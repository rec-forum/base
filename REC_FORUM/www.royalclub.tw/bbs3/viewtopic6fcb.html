				<div class="content">Session I  <br /><br />Chapter XII  :　THE ATTACK BY FIRE 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　<br /><br />孫子曰：凡火攻有五：一曰火人，二曰火積，三曰火輜，四曰火庫， 五曰火隊。<br />Sun Tzu said: There are five kinds of fire attacks: 1, burning personnel; 2, burning provisions; 3, burning equipment; 4, burning stores; 5, burning weapons.<br />----------------------------------------<br />The below article was translated by Lionel Giles in  1910<br />行火必有因，煙火必素具。發火有時，起火有日。時者， 天之燥也。日者，月在萁、壁、翼、軫也。凡此四宿者，風起之日也。<br />In order to carry out an attack, we must have means available. The material for raising fire should always be kept in readiness. There is a proper season for making attacks with fire, and special days for starting a conflagration. The proper season is when the weather is very dry; the special days are those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve, the Wall, the Wing or the Cross-bar; for these four are all days of rising wind.<br /><br />凡火攻，必因五火之變而應之。火發于內，則早應之于外。火發而其 兵靜者，待而勿攻。極其火力，可從而從之，不可從而止。火可發于 外，無待于內，以時發之。火發上風，無攻下風。<br />In attacking with fire, one should be prepared to meet five possible developments: (1) When fire breaks out inside to enemy's camp, respond at once with an attack from without. (2) If there is an outbreak of fire, but the enemy's soldiers remain quiet, bide your time and do not attack. (3) When the force of the flames has reached its height, follow it up with an attack, if that is practicable; if not, stay where you are. (4) If it is possible to make an assault with fire from without, do not wait for it to break out within, but deliver your attack at a favorable moment. (5) When you start a fire, be to windward of it. Do not attack from the leeward.<br />--------------------------------------<br />The below article was  translated by  Samuel B. Griffith  in 1963<br />晝風久，夜風止。 <br />When the wind blows during the day it will die down at<br />night.<br /><br /><br />凡軍必知有五火之變，以數守之。故以火佐攻者明，以水佐攻者強。水可以絕，不可以奪。 <br />12. Now the army must know the five different fire-attack<br />situations and be constantly vigilant. <br />13. Those who use fire to assist their attacks are intelligent;<br />those who use inundations are powerful.<br />1 4. Water can isolate an enemy but cannot destroy his supplies<br />or equipment. <br /><br />夫戰勝攻取，而不修其功者凶，命曰“費留”。故曰：明主慮之，良將修之。非利不動，非得不用，非危不戰。主不可以怒而興師，將不可以慍而致戰。<br />15. Now to win battles and take your objectives, but to fail to<br />exploit these achievements is ominous and may be described<br />as 'wasteful delay'.<br /><br />16. And therefore it is said that enlightened rulers deliberate<br />upon the plans, and good generals execute them.<br />1 7. If not in the interests of the state, do not act. If you cannot succeed, do not use troops. If you are not in danger, do not fight.<br /><br />18. A sovereign cannot raise an army because he is enraged,<br />nor can a general fight because he is resentful. <br />合于利而動，不合于利而止。<span style="color: #FF0000">怒可以復喜，慍可以復悅，亡國不可以復存，死者不可以復生。故明君慎之，良將警之。此安國全軍之道也。</span><br />19.For while anangered man may again be happy, and a resentful man again<br />be pleased, a state that has perished cannot be restored, nor<br />can the dead be brought back to life.<br />20. Therefore, the enlightened ruler is prudent and the good<br />general is warned against rash action.  Thus the state is kept<br />secure and the army preserved. <br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Q 1. Which version do you like prefer ?

Aside from not  being irritable , what  personalities are vital for excellent generals ?<br /><br />******************************************************<br />Session II<br /> Chapter  V :  Energy<br />1. Sun Tzu said: The control of a large force is the same<br />principle as the control of a few men: it is merely a   question of dividing up their numbers.<br />2. Fighting with a large army under your command is<br />nowise different from fighting with a small one: it is<br />merely a question of instituting signs and signals.<br />3. To ensure that your whole host may withstand the<br />brunt of the enemy’s attack and remain unshaken—this<br />is effected by maneuvers direct and indirect.<br />4. That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an egg—this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.<br />5. In all fighting, the direct method may be used for<br />joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed in<br />order to secure victory.<br />6. Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhaustible<br />as Heaven and Earth, unending as the flow of rivers<br />and streams; like the sun and moon, they end but to<br />begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away to<br />return once more.<br />7. There are not more than five musical notes, yet the<br />combinations of these five give rise to more melodies<br />than can ever be heard.<br />8. There are not more than five primary colors (blue,<br />yellow, red, white, and black), yet in combination they<br />produce more hues than can ever been seen.<br />9. There are not more than five cardinal tastes (sour,<br />acrid, salt, sweet, bitter), yet combinations of them<br />yield more flavors than can ever be tasted.<br />10. In battle, there are not more than two methods of<br />attack—the direct and the indirect; yet these two in<br />combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers.<br />11. The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in<br />turn. It is like moving in a circle—you never come to<br />an end. Who can exhaust the possibilities of their combination?<br />12. The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent<br />which will even roll stones along in its course.<br />13. The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop<br />of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim.<br />14. Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his<br />onset, and prompt in his decision.<br />15. Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow; decision, to the releasing of a trigger.<br />16. Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may be<br />seeming disorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid<br />confusion and chaos, your array may be without head<br />or tail, yet it will be proof against defeat.<br />17. Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline,<br />simulated fear postulates courage; simulated weakness<br />postulates strength.<br />18. Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of subdivision; concealing courage  under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent<br />energy; masking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical dispositions.<br />19. Thus one who is skillful at keeping the enemy on<br />the move maintains deceitful appearances, according to<br />which the enemy will act. He sacrifices something,<br />that the enemy may snatch at it.<br />20. By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march;<br />then with a body of picked men he lies in wait for him.<br />21. The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and does not require too much from individuals. Hence his ability to pick out the right men and<br />utilize combined energy.<br />22. When he utilizes combined energy, his fighting<br />men become as it were like unto rolling logs or stones.<br />For it is the nature of a log or stone to remain motionless on level ground, and to move when on a slope; if<br />four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if roundshaped, to go rolling down.<br />23. Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is<br />as the momentum of a round stone rolled down a<br />mountain thousands of feet in height. So much on the<br />subject of energy.<br />------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Q 1. From my angle I find 6 &quot;奇&quot;s  in this chapter only because Sun Tzu emphasized &quot; the direct and the indirect in combination&quot;. (<span style="color: #FF0000">奇正相生</span>) <br />When you read &quot; That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against an egg—this is effected by the science of weak points and strong&quot;, you're encouraged to read chap 6 if you wanna get a complete understanding .<br />So far because my ability fails to find perfect counterpart in English to 奇. I adopt Wu Sun Lin's (林戊蓀) translation -&quot;qi&quot;.<br />A. How &quot;qi &quot; could you imagine to deal with  your past troubles  ? Did  it work? <br />B. How to tell your opponent is using indirect way / strong enough ? <br />Q 2. How to choose the right man to the right  position and exploit situation(<span style="color: #FF0000">擇人任勢</span>)?<br />Q 3.  Welcome you  to  present your own questions about this article on line in advance for selecting .And during this session we do some brainstorming by everyone's expertise to get better / convincing conclusions.<br />*******************************************************************<br />Agenda<br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />8:10 ~ 8:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:25 ~ 8:30pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:30 ~9:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~9:30pm Concluding remarks/feedback from newcomers<br /><br />The meeting place of Thursday:<br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第一區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
