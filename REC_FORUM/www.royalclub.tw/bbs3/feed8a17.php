Offshore wind power firms see Taiwan as key battleground to expand in Asia<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/lang/archives/2018/05/09/2003692737">http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/lang/ar ... 2003692737</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Taiwan is becoming the next battleground for the world’s top offshore wind developers as they seek a foothold in Asia for a technology that has been expanding fast in Europe.<br />Taiwan announced results last Monday of its first major offshore wind farm auction that aims to add 3.8 gigawatts (GW) of capacity to its existing network of just 8 megawatts (MW).<br />The island’s offshore wind market is expected to expand to 5.5GW by 2025, and the government aims to invest US$23 billion on onshore and offshore wind projects by 2025.<br />Taiwan is making a big push to attract investments in renewable technology as it phases out nuclear power by 2025, after the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan highlighted the risks of using nuclear energy in a region prone to earthquakes.<br />European players win bulk of Taiwan offshore wind auction<br />For developers in Europe, where expanding offshore wind projects, particularly in the North Sea have driven down costs, Taiwan is seen as a route into Asian markets, such as Japan and South Korea, where the technology is still barely used.<br />Denmark’s Orsted and Germany’s wpd were last Monday’s biggest winners, securing contracts to install 900MW and 1GW of capacity, respectively.<br />“We see Taiwan as a stepping stone into Asia-Pacific,” said Matthias Bausenwein, the regional general manager for Orsted, the world’s largest owner of offshore **wind power** sites that was previously known as DONG Energy.<br />Strong wind speeds make island an attractive market<br />Taiwan’s auction drew bids from the world’s biggest international players, attracted by the island’s strong winds, a stable regulatory framework and the offer of 20-year power purchase agreements with a feed-in-tariff above European benchmarks.<br />“We have aggressive targets in Taiwan and, with things going on in China, South Korea and other markets, that amounts to it becoming the fastest-growing region globally,” said Bausenwein.<br />Falling costs<br />Offshore wind power is costlier than onshore projects or solar power, and still only accounts for about 3.5 percent of global wind energy capacity.<br />But Europe has been leading the way in using the technology, adding 3GW last year and taking total offshore capacity to 19GW, according to the Global Wind Energy Council.<br />Costs have plunged as a result. In Britain, the world’s biggest market, the cost of wind power fell below new nuclear generation for the first time last year.<br />Companies seek to develop local turbine suppliers<br />European firms want local suppliers to avoid the cost of shipping bulky equipment used in the turbines from Europe.<br />“The requirements for local content are increasing step by step,” said Andreas Nauen, offshore chief executive for Siemens Gamesa, adding some European equipment would initially be used. Siemens Gamesa is working to develop the Port of Taichung as a regional hub and has signed agreements with some local partners that could provide gear locally.<br />MHI Vestas, a venture between Japan’s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Danish turbine maker Vestas, is also considering developing local manufacturing. “We want to produce locally because we want to be competitive,” the joint venture’s chief executive, Philippe Kavafyan, told Reuters.<br />Question<br />1.Do you think offshore wind power has highly potential to become the main electricity sources in the future? What kind of challenges should solve right now?<br />2.There are three options, which one will you pick up?<br />A.Pay 3 times of electricity bill to use the green power. Why?<br />B.Built up Electric power plant near your home with air pollution late. Why?<br />C.Try our best to save electricity and prepare No air condition sometimes in the summer time. Why? <br />3. Follow the last question, if you were right to make final decision, how do you persuade your people who don’t agree in your opinion? <br /><br /><br />10 Friends Everyone Should AVOID!<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fStuMPuxa5k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fStuMPuxa5k</a><!-- m --><br />1.The negative friend<br />2.The competitive friend<br />3.The friends with benefits<br />4.The justified friend<br />5.Friend always wants to fight<br />6.The P.A.U friend(acronym friend)<br />7.Clueless friend<br />8.Social friend<br />9.Donald Trump<br />10.Always like to interrupt you<br /><br />Question<br />1.What kind of friend you get rid of? <br />2.What kind of friend you keep it? <br />3.Have some friends had hurt you?
