Article 1: How to handle conflicts with humor<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://exploringyourmind.com/handle-conflicts-humor/">https://exploringyourmind.com/handle-conflicts-humor/</a><!-- m --><br />Managing conflicts by taking things with humor not only allows for resolving disagreements, but also strengthens relationships. In fact, different studies show that one can overcome adversity if one manages to maintain joy. Conflict management is nothing less, since humor plays a similar role when confronting a conflict.<br />You can avoid many confrontations and resolve arguments and disagreements with good humor, since humor can help say things that might otherwise be difficult to express without offending someone. However, it is important to laugh with the other person, not at them.<br />When humor and play are used to reduce tension and anger, by reframing problems and putting the situation into perspective, the conflict can become an opportunity for greater connection and intimacy.<br />Humor is an effective tool in conflict management<br />Laughter is the best medicine, as it relieves stress, elevates mood, improves creativity and makes us more resilient. But it is not only good for emotional and physical health. It is also good for relationships. Laughter brings people together and creates intimacy. Laughter is a particularly powerful tool for managing conflicts and reducing stress.<br />In general, humor plays an important role in all kinds of relationships. In new relationships, humor can be an effective tool not only to attract another person, but also to overcome any discomfort or embarrassment that arises when you meet them. In already established relationships, humor can maintain emotion and freshness, as well as help to not accumulate anger or discomfort by problems not satisfactorily resolved.<br />Sharing the pleasure of humor creates a sense of intimacy and connection between two people; qualities that define solid and successful relationships. Laughing with the other creates a positive bond between the two. This union acts as a buffer against stress, disagreements, disappointments and problems that accumulate over time.<br />The power of humor in relationships<br />Conflict is an inevitable part of any kind of relationship. In addition, any conflict can be aggravated, even a small one, simply by reacting by letting yourself be driven by emotions or by the accumulation of bad memories by poorly managed conflicts in the past.<br />When conflict arises, humor and play can help clear things up and restore the connection. If used with skill and respect, a little humor can turn conflict and tension into an opportunity for shared fun and intimacy. In addition, this makes it possible to handle the situation, express one’s opinion and even formulate a solution without hurting the other’s feelings.<br />Although humor is not a miracle cure for conflicts, it can be an important tool to help overcome difficult times that affect all relationships occasionally. On the one hand, humor interrupts the struggle for power that is usually reached in conflicts, as it almost immediately removes tension, allowing reconnecting and regaining perspective.<br />In addition, laughter and shared play help free yourself from rigid forms of thinking and behavior. This allows you to see the problem in a new way and find a creative solution. Humor also frees us from inhibitions. We feel free to express what we really feel, letting our most genuine emotions surface.<br />How to use humor to smooth over and manage conflicts<br />To handle conflicts with humor, it is not enough to laugh at everyone by starting with oneself. Not everyone has the same sense of humor nor they are they able to get into “joke mode” at the same speed. Also, it is possible that your humor is not understood by everyone.<br />These are just a few things to keep in mind. For this strategy to be effective it is important to consider the following:<br />1. Make sure that everyone is joking and that everyone understands your humor<br />Making harsh, sarcastic comments or criticizing the other person for not being able to accept a joke will create even more problems and can even damage a relationship. Humor can only help overcome the conflict when both parties are joking and connect with the same sense of humor.<br />It is important to be sensitive to the other person. When the joke is unilateral rather than mutual, it only manages to undermine the trust and goodwill of the other person. That’s why humor should be just as fun and enjoyable for everyone involved.<br />2. Do not use humor to cover up other emotions<br />Humor helps us to be resistant towards the challenges of life. But there are times when it is not a good idea to resort to humor, for example, when it is used to cover up or avoid other emotions rather than coping with them. Laughter can be a disguise for feelings of pain, fear, anger and disappointment when you want to avoid them or when you do not know how to express them.<br />Although humor always gives us a chance to have fun, the reality is that covering up the truth is not funny. When we use humor and play as a disguise for other emotions, we are generating confusion and mistrust in relationships.<br />3. Develop a smarter sense of humor<br />It’s easier for some than for others to use humor, especially in stressful situations. That makes it necessary to develop a sense of humor that knows how to adapt to the circumstances. One of these skills is learning to discover the signs in the other person that indicate that they appreciate your efforts to take the tension off the subject and that they value humor as a way to deal with it.<br />It is also important to use a humor without sarcasm. Sarcasm only seeks to hurt the other or uses resources that can hurt others, even if it is not your intention. In fact, it is much more effective to start laughing at yourself.<br />Discussion:<br />1.How do you usually handle conflicts? Do you think if humor is an effective tool in conflict management? Why or why not?<br />2.How to use humor to smooth over and manage conflicts?<br />3.Could you share your experiences in using humor to deal with conflicts or embarrassing situation? If you have nothing to share, pls tell a joke at least to make some laughter in the team.<br />4.How to develop a sense of humor?<br /><br />Article 2: Top 10 reasons why employees quit their jobs<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.thebalance.com/top-reasons-why-employees-quit-their-job-1918985">https://www.thebalance.com/top-reasons- ... ob-1918985</a><!-- m --><br />Employees quit their job for many reasons. They follow spouses across the country, stay home with children, and go back to school. Those reasons are tough to address by an employer because they involve life events in the employee’s world outside of work.<br />But, the majority of reasons why employees quit their job are under the control of the employer. In fact, any element of your current workplace, your culture and environment, the employee’s perception of his job and opportunities are all factors that the employer affects.<br />The best way to retain employees is to stay in touch with what they’re thinking. Are they happy with their work? Are their needs for challenge, belonging, development, and meaningful work met? Do they have the communication, problem-solving, feedback, and recognition that they need from their boss?<br />If you stay in touch with your employees, you can head off potential retention issues. But, you must think about employee retention every day. Are the systems, processes, and requirements in your company supportive of employees?<br />Do they support the most important needs of your employees for meaningful work, market compensation and benefits, and the ability to have an effect on their work and workplace? Most importantly, do they make employees want to stay?<br />Ask them. Hold stay interviews to determine why employees stay with your organization. Then, pay attention to and enhance the factors they identify that keep them coming back every day.<br />Employees job search for a reason. Find out what it is before the employee announces her departure.<br />Sure, a great opportunity drops into an employee’s lap occasionally. But, this is not the norm. Provide that great opportunity in your company — and know what that great opportunity is — to retain your best employees.<br />Here are 10 critical reasons why employees quit their job. You can manage them.<br />1. Relationship with boss<br />Employees don’t need to be friends with their boss but they need to have a relationship. The boss is too much of an integral part of their daily lives at work for an uncomfortable relationship.<br />The boss provides direction and feedback, spends time in one-to-one meetings, and connects the employee to the larger organization. To have a toxic relationship with the person an employee reports to undermines the employee’s engagement, confidence, and commitment.<br />A bad boss is also the number one reason why employees quit their job. Here's how to get along with your boss.<br />2. Bored and unchallenged by the work itself<br />No one wants to be bored and unchallenged by their work. Really. If you have an employee who acts as if she is, you need to help her find her passion. Employees want to enjoy their job. They spend more than a third of their days working, getting ready for work, and transporting themselves to work.<br />Work closely with employees who report to you to ensure that each employee is engaged, excited, and challenged to contribute, create, and perform. Otherwise, you will lose them to an employer who will.<br />3. Relationships with coworkers<br />When an employee leaves my company, every email that is sent to the whole company, to say good-bye, includes a comment about passionate coworkers who the employee cares about and will miss. Second only to an employee’s manager, the coworkers with whom he sits, interacts, and serves with on teams, are critical components of an employee’s work environment.<br />Research from the Gallup organization indicates that one of the 12 factors that illuminate whether an employee is happy on their job is having a best friend at work. Relationships with coworkers retain employees.<br />Notice and intervene if problems exist.<br />4. Opportunities to use skills and abilities<br />When employees use their significant skills and abilities on the job, they feel a sense pride, accomplishment, and self-confidence. They are participating in activities that they are good at and that stretch their skills and abilities even further.<br />Employees want to develop and grow their skills. If they’re not able to do this in your jobs, they’ll find one where they can. This includes opportunity. If an employee can’t see a path to continued growth in their current organization, they are likely to look elsewhere for a career development or promotion opportunity. Make sure that you’re talking with them and that you know their hopes and dreams.<br />5. Contribution of work to the organization’s business goals<br />Managers need to sit with each reporting employee and discuss the relevance of the employee’s job and key contributions and deliverables to the overall strategy and business plan of the organization. Employees need to feel connected and that they are part of an effort that is larger than just their job.<br />Too many managers assume that the employee will receive the communication from executive staff and make this leap. They don’t. They need your help to understand and connect their job to the bigger picture. If they’re not part of it, you’ll lose them.<br />6. Autonomy and independence<br />Organizations talk about empowerment, autonomy, and independence, but they are not something that you can do to people or give them. They are traits and characteristics that an employee needs to pursue and embrace.<br />You are responsible for the work environment that enables them to do this. They are responsible for doing it.<br />A colleague presented a session about the Oz Principles at a recent company event. He pointed out that by creating a culture of accountability, you create empowerment as employees own and execute their responsibilities. Without this, your best employees will leave.<br />7. Meaningfulness of job<br />Ah, yes, meaningful work. We all want to do something that makes a difference, that isn’t busy work or transactional work, and that contributes to something bigger than ourselves. Ambitious and doable. But, managers must help employees see where their work contributes to the execution of deliverables that make a difference in the world.<br />With some products and services — cancer research, feeding the hungry, animal rescue, diagnosing and curing illnesses, producing milk or crops — meaningful is obvious, but everyone’s work needs the same meaningfulness. Help employees connect to why their work has meaning or they will find an employer who will.<br />8. Organization’s financial stability<br />Financial instability: a lack of sales, layoffs or reduced work hours, salary freezes, successful competitors highlighted in the news, bad press, employee turnover, mergers and acquiring companies, all lead to an employee’s feeling of instability and a lack of trust.<br />Employees who are worried tend to leave. Make every change and potential change transparent. Let them know how the business is doing at all times and what the organization’s plans are for staying on track or recovering in the future.<br />But, the most important issue here is the employees’ trust in and respect for the management team. If they respect your judgment, direction, and decision-making, they will stay. If not, they will leave. After all, they have the financial stability of their families to consider when they decide which executive they will follow — or not.<br />9. Overall corporate culture<br />While it’s not the top item on employee lists, the overall culture of your company makes a difference for employees. Does your organization appreciate employees, treat them with respect, and provide compensation, benefits, and perks that demonstrate respect and caring?<br />Is your work environment for people conducive to employee satisfaction and engagement? Do you provide events, employee activities, celebrations, and team building efforts that make employees feel that your organization is a great place to work?<br />Employees appreciate a workplace in which communication is transparent, management is accessible, executives are approachable and respected, and direction is clear and understood. Your overall culture keeps employees — or turns them away. Which gets you what you want and need for success?<br />10. Management’s recognition of employee job performance<br />Many place employee recognition further up the list, but this is where recognition scored in a recent Society for Human Resources Management (SHRM) survey of employees. While recognition is important, it is not among employees’ chief concerns.<br />A lack of recognition can affect many of the above factors, especially culture, but it’s probably not the deciding factor in an employee's decision to leave your organization. Provide a lot of genuine appreciation and recognition as icing on the cake for employee retention.<br />But, pay attention to the more significant factors, the cake, if you wish to retain your best employees. Make recognition the way you live in your organization to keep your best talent.<br />If you pay attention to these 10 factors, you will reduce turnover and retain your most wanted employees. If not, you’ll be holding regular exit interviews and good-bye lunches. It’s expensive to recruit a new employee. Why not expend the effort necessary to retain the employees that you have already painfully recruited and hired?<br /><br />Discussion:<br /><br />1.Are you happy with your work?  What makes you stay with your current company?<br />2.The relationship with your boss is critical for your work success and career progress.  How do you get along with your boss?<br />3.What will you do if you are bored and unchallenged by your work?  As a manager, what will you do if you have noticed that your employee gets bored with his/her job?<br />4.If you are a boss, what will you do to retain good employees?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=872">Shuman</a> — Wed May 09, 2018 10:24 pm</p><hr />
