A 19-year-old girl drove 51,000 kilometers alone in a light plane to travel <br />around 52 counties around the world. This sounds incredible, have you <br />ever wondered how she did it, because the whole process involves very <br />complicated issues, right? How do you feel about this? Do you know <br />what kind of challenges she has to face and deal with by herself during <br />this trip?<br />2. If your child wants to do something extremely challenging and <br />dangerous, if this matter is meaningful, will you agree and support or <br />even encourage her?<br />3. Have you ever achieved or engaged in extremely difficult and <br />challenging things or still dream of doing something crazy or pursuing <br />something out of the ordinary, please share with us?<br />4. Do you know the motivation for this young girl this time? What kind of <br />enlightenment or model will it bring to women or the world? <br />Session 2<br />WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT <br />HOMELESSNESS IN TAIWAN <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://borgenproject.org/what-you-need-to-know-about-homelessness-in-taiwan/?nowprocket=1">https://borgenproject.org/what-you-need ... wprocket=1</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Question<br />1. According to statistics, there were about 9,000 homeless people in <br />Taiwan in 2016, including more than 4,600 in new Taipei city and about <br />1,000 in Taipei. Do you know the reason why they become homeless? <br />How do they survive? Were they worthy of sympathy and why?<br />2. Our government want to help them provide with shelters, but most of <br />them are reluctant to move in. Do you really know why?<br />3. Homeless people sleeping on public aera seem to be affect the <br />appearance of the city and the image of the country, whenever you see <br />a group of homeless people at Taipei Main Station or an important park, <br />how do you feel?<br />4. In your opinion, is there any way to bring homeless people back to <br />society or the workplace and make them disappear gradually?<br />5. Winter is coming, have you ever thought about providing anything to <br />help them? Do you know what they need most and through which <br />agency or organization to help them?<br /><br />P.S.<br />1.參加三次後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />2.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~</div>
