			<div class="content">Article I : How to become a polyglot<br />by BENNY LEWIS<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/how-to-become-a-polyglot/">https://www.fluentin3months.com/how-to- ... -polyglot/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />What is a polyglot?<br />One of the most frequent questions I get asked is How can I become a polyglot like you? A polyglot is someone who can speak several languages. You can see me demonstrate the ones that I know in the compilation video below, which gives people a tour of my old site design (which has since been hugely updated).<br /><br />While it may seem impressive in the Anglophone world, multilingualism is quite normal in many cultures. Out of the places that I've been to, the west of Ireland has several bilingual individuals (Irish and English), Quebec has plenty who speak both French and English perfectly, Catalonia has Spanish and Catalan natives, a lot of Europeans speak 3 or more languages quite fluently, and many Indians I met spoke an impressive 5 or more Indian languages (as well as English), which can be extremely different compared to one another.<br /><br />In my attempt to expand my horizons and try my best to get to know a country's culture, learning its language it's just a natural step to take, which I've repeated several times. Today I'll give you some points on how to do that if you are trying it yourself!<br /><br />Motivation to be a polyglot<br />If you are learning several languages for the wrong reasons and go for quantity rather than quality, without appreciating each one, then all you will really get is a basic staggering command over an “impressive” number of languages.<br /><br />The start of my interest in languages started in Spain. I met this fascinating Brazilian guy who had a perfect American accent on his English, lovely Spanish, flowing French and, of course, Portuguese.<br /><br />We were part of an international exchange program for engineers and architects and we would all socialise together, and he would turn his head between several of us and flick between each of his languages with perfect ease, and converse with people in their native language.<br /><br />This was the coolest thing that I had ever seen! My plans to go back to Ireland to study for a Masters were thrown out the window, and my life appreciating languages began.<br /><br />Even though the only language that I spoke was English, I wanted to become a polyglotand I have been committed to that mission ever since! I had plenty of work ahead of me and spent months trying to speak Spanish without making any progress until I figured out the obvious problem that most people don't seem to get, but after years of work with several other languages, I feel like I can now safely call myself a polyglot too.<br /><br />As I keep saying on this blog, this is not down to any kind of natural talents, genetic heritage, lucky horseshoes or alien experimentation. It's just from treating the problem scientifically and using the right study methods and applying the right attitude, which anyone else can do too.<br /><br />So here are a few of my pointers if you would ultimately like to become a polyglot too some day!<br /><br />Some suggestions<br />Your first foreign language (if you don't already speak one) should be as straightforward to learn as possible. The priority is to learn how to think in a foreign language. After your first one, the next one can be dramatically easier if your learning approach was efficient enough the first time; getting over the mental barrier of accepting that you can communicate in a foreign language is the most important step you may ever make in terms of language learning, and is a harder realization to make than you may think.<br /><br />I've already said it, but this deserves repetition: You should be passionate about each language. Don't just add a language to your list because it would be cool. Apart from Esperanto, most languages involve a huge amount of studies and work and this can be disheartening and you may very simply give up unless you have several reasons to continue trying. <br /><br />Practise all languages as often as possible. Although you should only learn one language at a time, once you reach intermediate stage, the risk of confusing it is greatly reduced, so now you can switch between languages as often as you like! <br /><br />Staying in the same language family greatly reduces your workload. I don't want to suggest that you don't expand your horizons to Asian and other languages, but the order in which I learned languages made it so much easier to continue to the next one with much less work. After Spanish (first language), I learned Italian, which is very understandable to Spanish speakers despite being quite different. After Italian, I went on to French, which is surprisingly similar to Italian (especially written), despite sounding completely different. After French I tried Portuguese. The amount of work required to become fluent was reduced each time.<br /><br />Languages within a family are very different and unique, but it is “easier” to learn several of them and this is a “shortcut” that polyglots like me have used, although be under no illusion that you will always have a huge amount of work to do!<br />Study each language the right way. There are good methods to learn a language quickly and efficiently. I've written about some of my suggestions; if your study methods and attitude aren't good enough to learn one language, there's no way you can learn several!<br /><br />Be clear about why you want to be a polyglot. If it's just for bragging rights you will be very unlikely to succeed, as I mentioned above. I personally like to get to know cultures in my travels almost entirely by speaking with regular people who don't necessarily have to speak English (which is not so common outside of touristy zones in many places), so speaking several languages is a natural part of this since I travel a lot.<br /><br />Know when it's time to start the next language. Once you reach intermediate or higher in one language, if your ultimate goal is to speak several languages. You need to know when it's time to move on (while making sure you will be able to maintain that language). This is a tough decision to make because you will have to learn to…<br /><br />Be ready to feel very stupid! Yes, you will have to be open to feeling like an idiot… several times over! When you learn any language for the first time, you have to feel like a child who can't communicate fully in the early stages and this can be very frustrating.<br /><br />Bring your entire focus back to languages you've already learned. This is what I'm currently doing with my other languages. It's also a good excuse for me to return to my favourite country! Although I mentioned above that you could move on after reaching intermediate stage (however a higher level is more desirable before stopping), you should never consider your studies in a single language complete. There will always be more to learn!<br /><br />I've got several other tips for how to become a polyglot, and on how not to confuse languages or forget them across the blog. If you have any of your own suggestions on how to become multilingual, do share them!<br /><br />DISCUSSION:<br />(1). What are the advantages and price of becoming a polyglot?<br />(2).

What is your way to become a polyglot, compared with this article?<br />=============================================================================================================<br /><br />Article II : The single biggest reason why startups succeed by BILL GROSS<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gross_the_single_biggest_reason_why_startups_succeed/transcript">https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gross_th ... transcript</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I'm really excited to share with you some findings that really surprise me about what makes companies succeed the most, what factors actually matter the most for startup success. I believe that the startup organization is one of the greatest forms to make the world a better place. If you take a group of people with the right equity incentives and organize them in a startup, you can unlock human potential in a way never before possible. You get them to achieve unbelievable things.<br /><br />But if the startup organization is so great, why do so many fail? That's what I wanted to find out. I wanted to find out what actually matters most for startup success. And I wanted to try to be systematic about it, avoid some of my instincts and maybe misperceptions I have from so many companies I've seen over the years. I wanted to know this because I've been starting businesses since I was 12 years old when I sold candy at the bus stop in junior high school, to high school, when I made solar energy devices, to college, when I made loudspeakers. And when I graduated from college, I started software companies. And 20 years ago, I started Idealab, and in the last 20 years, we started more than 100 companies, many successes, and many big failures. We learned a lot from those failures.<br /><br />So I tried to look across what factors accounted the most for company success and failure. So I looked at these five. First, the idea. I used to think that the idea was everything. I named my company Idealab for how much I worship the &quot;aha!&quot; moment when you first come up with the idea. But then over time, I came to think that maybe the team, the execution, adaptability, that mattered even more than the idea. I never thought I'd be quoting boxer Mike Tyson on the TED stage, but he once said, &quot;Everybody has a plan, until they get punched in the face.&quot; (Laughter) And I think that's so true about business as well. So much about a team's execution is its ability to adapt to getting punched in the face by the customer. The customer is the true reality. And that's why I came to think that the team maybe was the most important thing.<br /><br />Then I started looking at the business model. Does the company have a very clear path generating customer revenues? That started rising to the top in my thinking about maybe what mattered most for success. Then I looked at the funding. Sometimes companies received intense amounts of funding. Maybe that's the most important thing? And then of course, the timing. Is the idea way too early and the world's not ready for it? Is it early, as in, you're in advance and you have to educate the world? Is it just right? Or is it too late, and there's already too many competitors? So I tried to look very carefully at these five factors across many companies. And I looked across all 100 Idealab companies, and 100 non-Idealab companies to try and come up with something scientific about it.<br /><br />So first, on these Idealab companies, the top five companies -- Citysearch, CarsDirect, GoTo, NetZero, Tickets.com -- those all became billion-dollar successes. And the five companies on the bottom -- Z.com, Insider Pages, MyLife, Desktop Factory, Peoplelink -- we all had high hopes for, but didn't succeed. So I tried to rank across all of those attributes how I felt those companies scored on each of those dimensions. And then for non-Idealab companies, I looked at wild successes, like Airbnb and Instagram and Uber and Youtube and LinkedIn. And some failures: Webvan, Kozmo, Pets.com Flooz and Friendster. The bottom companies had intense funding, they even had business models in some cases, but they didn't succeed. I tried to look at what factors actually accounted the most for success and failure across all of these companies, and the results really surprised me.<br /><br />The number one thing was timing. Timing accounted for 42 percent of the difference between success and failure. Team and execution came in second, and the idea, the differentiability of the idea, the uniqueness of the idea, that actually came in third. Now, this isn't absolutely definitive, it's not to say that the idea isn't important, but it very much surprised me that the idea wasn't the most important thing. Sometimes it mattered more when it was actually timed.<br /><br />The last two, business model and funding, made sense to me actually. I think business model makes sense to be that low because you can start out without a business model and add one later if your customers are demanding what you're creating. And funding, I think as well, if you're underfunded at first but you're gaining traction, especially in today's age, it's very, very easy to get intense funding. So now let me give you some specific examples about each of these. So take a wild success like Airbnb that everybody knows about. Well, that company was famously passed on by many smart investors because people thought, &quot;No one's going to rent out a space in their home to a stranger.&quot;Of course, people proved that wrong. But one of the reasons it succeeded, aside from a good business model, a good idea, great execution, is the timing.<br /><br />That company came out right during the height of the recession when people really needed extra money, and that maybe helped people overcome their objection to renting out their own home to a stranger. Same thing with Uber. Uber came out, incredible company, incredible business model, great execution, too. But the timing was so perfect for their need to get drivers into the system. Drivers were looking for extra money; it was very, very important.<br /><br />Some of our early successes, Citysearch, came out when people needed web pages. GoTo.com, which we announced actually at TED in 1998, was when companies were looking for cost-effective ways to get traffic. We thought the idea was so great, but actually, the timing was probably maybe more important. And then some of our failures. We started a company called Z.com, it was an online entertainment company. We were so excited about it -- we raised enough money, we had a great business model, we even signed incredibly great Hollywood talent to join the company. But broadband penetration was too low in 1999-2000. It was too hard to watch video content online, you had to put codecs in your browser and do all this stuff, and the company eventually went out of business in 2003.<br /><br />Just two years later, when the codec problem was solved by Adobe Flash and when broadband penetration crossed 50 percent in America, YouTube was perfectly timed. Great idea, but unbelievable timing. In fact, YouTube didn't even have a business model when it first started. It wasn't even certain that that would work out. But that was beautifully, beautifully timed.<br /><br />So what I would say, in summary, is execution definitely matters a lot. The idea matters a lot. But timing might matter even more. And the best way to really assess timing is to really look at whether consumers are really ready for what you have to offer them. And to be really, really honest about it,not be in denial about any results that you see, because if you have something you love, you want to push it forward, but you have to be very, very honest about that factor on timing.<br /><br />As I said earlier, I think startups can change the world and make the world a better place. I hope some of these insights can maybe help you have a slightly higher success ratio, and thus make something great come to the world that wouldn't have happened otherwise.<br /><br />DISCUSSIONS:<br />(1). What kind of startups do you know from your country/city? How successful are they?<br />(2). Have you ever been involved in a startup or maybe had an idea that could be turned into a startup?<br />(3). Why do you think so many startups fail?<br />(4). What do you think about the factors that the speaker mentioned? Do you agree with his conclusions?</div>
