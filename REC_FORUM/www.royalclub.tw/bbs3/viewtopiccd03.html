Yet dozens of years later it becomes clear that it’s better to be alone than to live with a person who brings a lot of disappointment, pain, and offenses.<br /><br /><br />Spent little time with loved ones<br />! !<br />In the cycle of work and home duties, many of us pay very little attention to our loved ones. Unfortunately, we often understand this at a tragic time: children grow up and start an independent life, warm relationships with spouses disappear, something tragic happens to parents.<br /><br /><br />Wasted a lot of time<br />! !<br />Watching TV shows, chatting in social networks, games on the phone — all of it takes an impressive amount of time. Yet you could spend it on much more useful things and thereby significantly improve the quality of your life.<br /><br /><br />Led an unhealthy lifestyle<br />! !<br />We ruin our health when we give in to temptations every day and have bad habits. And even if our health seems to be ok now, after a while we’ll most likely feel the consequences of such a frivolous attitude toward it.<br /><br /><br />Spent little time traveling<br />! !<br />Few of us don’t dream about traveling. Yet the desire to travel with comfort or our responsibilities stop people from this quite often. Yet comfort is not the most necessary thing, and you’ll always have urgent things to do, so...<br /><br /><br />Worked too much<br />! !<br />Most often people do so if they have no other values. Work is important, but don’t forget to relax from time to time.<br /><br /><br />Stopped learning new things<br />! !<br />Many people believe that one degree is enough. True, it’s good if you have one. Yet constant development brings not only more opportunities for professional growth but also an increase in self-confidence, making you<br />an interesting person to others.<br /><br /><br />Having a job they hate<br />! !<br />We often continue to work in a place we hate only because of our own indecisiveness and unwillingness to leave our comfort zone. Yet if we don’t risk and change something in our lives, we can simply fade away in a job<br />we’re not interested in.<br /><br /><br />Dreamed too much but took little action<br />! !<br />If you don’t take any steps to make your desires come true, everything will remain just a fantasy. If you wait for the perfect conditions for all your life, you may never have a chance.<br /><br /><br />Q1: Do you regret something you have ever done or never done?<br /><br />Q2: The reality is &quot;If you don’t take any steps to make your desires come true, everything will remain just a fantasy. If you wait for the perfect conditions for all your life, you may never have a chance.” But why people still dream too much and take little action?<br /><br />Q3: Do you think that watching TV shows, chatting in social networks, and playing games on the phone are wasting time?<br /><br />=============================================================================================<br />Article 2: 10 Interpersonal skills to land you that dream job<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.opencolleges.edu.au/careers/top-10-interpersonalskills#section13-link">http://www.opencolleges.edu.au/careers/ ... ion13-link</a><!-- m --><br /><br />According to Wikipedia, interpersonal skills relate to a person’s “EQ” (Emotional Intelligence Quotient). This is the cluster of personality traits, social graces, communication, language, personal habits, friendliness, and<br />optimism that characterise our relationships with other people<br /><br />In today’s job market, having technical skills is not enough. You need to go beyond the call of duty and show that you have what it takes to fit within the organisation’s culture.<br /><br />Recruiters today have pre-screening tests available at their disposal, to weed out applicants before they even get to the interview stage. They use personality tests and assessments and gauge who will be a better fit between two applicants of similar qualifications and experience. They rely on identifying interpersonal skills. Interpersonal skills will give you a chance to differentiate from other job applicants as well as work mates and move up the ladder. These complement your technical skills, enhance your job performance and social interactions, and work hard to give you an edge over others. Unlike hard skills, these are interpersonal.<br /><br />1. Self confidence<br />How confident are you that you are the best person for this job? The answer to this question is easy: research the company and the position you are applying for. When you have done your homework, you get that inner<br />sense of assuredness. In the interview, you are fully prepared and nothing can throw you off balance. In the job itself, you are totally confident.<br /><br />2. Positive attitude<br />“The largest part to your overall health is from your mental health. Having positive mental health gives us the motivation to do our best. It also makes us strive to do better.” How can you show your interviewer that you have a positive attitude?<br /><br />3. Communication<br />This skill is particularly important: the ability to read, write and speak clearly is essential.<br />Subscribers to the Harvard Business Review rated &quot;the ability to communicate&quot; the most important factor in making an executive &quot;promotable,&quot; more important than ambition, education, and capacity for hard work.<br />Graduates (as measured by both career advancement and salary) shared personality traits and critical thinking skills that distinguish good communicators: a desire to persuade, an interest in talking and working with other people, and an outgoing, ascendant personality.<br /><br />4. Team player<br />This one is especially useful if you are applying for a highly technical position and/or requires independent work like IT, design, writing etc. People who can go beyond working in their area of expertise, demonstrate big picture thinking, take leadership roles when necessary and work for the greater good are considered a great asset to any organisation.<br /><br />5. Critical thinking and problem solving<br />Are you generally a resourceful person? Even if you don’t have all the answers, would you be able to look for them? Know what to do? People who take ownership and are ready to own up their mistakes are highly regarded by the organisation.<br /><br />6. Time Management skill<br />“It's important that you develop effective strategies for managing your time to balance the conflicting demands of time for study, leisure, earning money and job&quot; Kent University<br /><br />7. Copy with pressure<br />Some jobs are easy-going where some demand a high level of pressure tolerance: Jobs where you are working to meet strict deadlines or where things can get turned around at the last minute. The employer might prefer you over others if you are known for crisis control and staying calm when all hell breaks loose.<br />Have you got a colourful story to demonstrate your past experience of working under pressure? Maybe you constantly had deadline stress or maybe you were working in a busy emergency department for the local hospital. Bringing that experience to light won’t hurt.<br /><br />8. Flexibility<br />The demand for flexible working arrangements, as well as flexible methods of study, has grown in recent years. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reports that nearly 150,000 students are studying online or “off-campus” in higher education alone – and that number is much higher when you include VET students.<br /><br />9. Accept feedback<br />Accepting negative feedback gracefully speaks volumes about your character and makes you extremely interesting in the eyes of the interview panel.<br /><br />10. Strong work ethic<br />A survey conducted by the Society for Human Resource Management compared the skills gap between older workers approaching retirement and younger workers starting work found that “professionalism” or “work ethic” is the top skill that younger workers lack. It said that companies are finding it harder to find punctual, reliable workers today<br /><br />Q1: Do you agree these interpersonal skills are as important as professional skill while applying jobs? Which one do you think is the most important one?<br /><br />Q2:Do you consider these interpersonal skills can be used in daily personal life while get along with family and friends?<br /><br />Q3: If you can give yourself scores on each single skill above, what will it be?<br />Anything you can do to improve?</div>
