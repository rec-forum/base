SESSION1:<br />What would you do? He's Not the Father, Would You Tell?<br />The hypothetical situation is that, you're sitting at a restaurant, and you can't help but overhear a conversation from the next table.  A young woman excited about her pregnancy.   she’s considering to tell her boyfriend who think he's the father but really isn't.  Worse yet, after a discussion with her friend, the expected mom still has no plans to tell her boyfriend the truth, because she thinks he will be the better option for the husband.  What would you do if you were the fly on the wall?<br />Please find the video from the link below,<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/33733">https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/33733</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Questions:<br />1.What would you do if you overheard it from the next table, will you save the innocent boy on the spot?<br />2.“He's not the Father”, if you were the friend of both the boy and girl, what will you do?<br />3.Is the pregnant girl so selfish or it can be one of the cures for her well-being? If you were her, are there any options you could choose for? <br />4.What if you were her parent, what would you do?<br /><br />**********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************<br />SESSION2:<br />Who are better, men or women?<br />I think it’s a wonderful question.  It is only juvenile to people who are still possessed by the Sixties myth of androgyny.  About fifty years ago we decided that if we all just hold hands, close our eyes and believe hard enough, the fundamental differences between men and women would disappear and we would all be the same, and on the heavenly road to equality.  The selfish motivations for this ploy do not concern us here.  But the fact remains that men and women are deeply and fundamentally different.  So this Quora question elicits a much more important one: better at what? Here is an arbitrary list:<br />War: men are better. Before we had lawyers men settled power struggles through combat. This is why we still speak of arms and armies. Men are better killers, though technology is rapidly changing this edge.<br />Sports: men definitely have the edge. These games were designed to display physical prowess used in combat. This is why we rarely allow men and women to compete against each other. It wouldn’t be fair due to undeniable innate differences.<br />Social Skills: I believe that on average women are just naturally more adept arbitrary at reading social situations, and understanding relationships between people.<br />Compassion: no contest. Women are naturally more compassionate.<br />Language skills: countless studies have shown that girls, on average, learn languages better, more completely than boys<br />Math skills: boys have an innate advantage in math<br />As Physicians: probably women<br />As Engineers: probably men<br />As Lawyers: take yer pick<br />As Dental Hygienists: probably women<br />As Auto Mechanics: probably men<br />As Food Servers: take yer pick<br />Heavy lifting: men are better<br />Child birth and breast feeding: definitely women<br />Parallel parking: men – but pretty soon we’ll all have self-driving cars so it won’t matter.<br />So which gender is better? that is subjective. It has to do with our entire spectrum of values. We’d like to be fair, and not discriminate on account of gender. But what if our values actually do favor one gender’s innate traits over the other? In such circumstances I can only speak for myself: women are better – better on average mind you - and not by much - but definitely the superior sex. <br /><br />Questions:<br />1.Who are better, men or women?<br />2.What was the best part of being a man or woman you’ve taken? how about the worst one you’ve suffered?  <br />3.If you could argue with god choosing any gender you want to be, which one would you prefer?<br />4.Which one is good at language skills, women or men? <br /><br />**********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************<br />Agenda<br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />8:10 ~ 8:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:25 ~ 8:30pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:30 ~9:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~9:30pm Concluding remarks/feedback from newcomers<br /><br />The meeting place of Thursday:<br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第一區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=13721">morris</a> — Fri Feb 15, 2019 2:09 pm</p><hr />
