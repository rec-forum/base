<span style="font-weight: bold">Session 1</span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">9 Reasons Why You Should Travel Alone</span><br />Link: <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/9-reasons-why-you-should-travel-alone.html" class="postlink">http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/9-reasons-why-you-should-travel-alone.html</a><br /><br />While it’s wonderful to share a special trip and new experiences with friends, a partner, or family, there’s a compelling case for travel alone from time to time. Solo travel can work for anyone, whether you’re single, in a relationship, extroverted, or introverted, and here are 9 good reasons why you should try it.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">1. Simple logistics</span><br />It can be challenging to coordinate a trip and time away from work with another busy person in your life, and it’s even more difficult when you try to make plans with a group. Usually, these challenges can be overcome by simply planning far in advance, but if you find yourself with some down time and you can’t find a travel partner on short notice, it may be the perfect time to pack your bags and go anyway.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">2. Work on your bucket list</span><br />Is there something you’ve been dying to try that no one is willing to try with you? Maybe you’d like to go skydiving over the Grand Canyon, see ancient Mayan ruins, or simply eat real Maine lobster. When your partner and friends don’t share every one of your interests, that’s OK, but it’s not OK to sacrifice your dreams, especially when all you have to do is get there.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">3. You’re great company</span><br />If you rarely spend significant time alone, you may be surprised at how enjoyable it can be. When was the last time you truly listened to only your thoughts and entertained only your dreams? Depending on the destination, a solo trip can be a powerful, introspective, life-changing experience. Imagine sitting on a peaceful beach at sunset or taking an invigorating morning hike without having to make conversation with anyone.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">4. Meet new people</span><br />If you’re a born extrovert, traveling alone can be a wonderful way to meet locals and make new friends. Often, people who are alone appear more approachable to others. Before you know it, you could be chatting with some interesting folks at a sidewalk cafe or even joining a group of like-minded people for yoga on the beach. The key is to keep an open mind while keeping safety in mind, especially in a foreign land.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">5. Do everything you want and nothing you don’t want</span><br />Have you ever been hesitant to do that half-day at the spa you were longing for because you felt bad leaving your travel partner with nothing to do? When you travel alone, you are not obliged to entertain anyone but yourself.  If you want to “waste” the day sitting at an outdoor bar drinking mojitos instead of sightseeing, you won’t have to answer to anyone.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">6. It’s empowering</span><br />If traveling makes you a better, smarter person, then traveling alone makes you super-better and super-smarter. For any of you who may feel uncomfortable even sitting alone at a diner to have breakfast, taking a trip by yourself might seem daunting. Once you take the plunge and get over your fears, you’ll feel a sense of empowerment. A successful solo vacation can inspire you to tackle even more things in life you’ve been afraid to try.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">7. Great service</span><br />For some reason, service at hotels and restaurants seems better when you’re traveling single. People tend to admire those who travel solo, and it’s possible that when you make it known, you could be in for a sweet room upgrade or a cocktail “on the house”.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">8. Absence makes the heart grow fonder</span><br />I don’t suggest you spend every vacation opportunity away from your partner, but doing so once in a while can be refreshing for a couple. When you set the precedent in your relationship that it’s OK to pursue individual interests, trust is enhanced. Coming home to your partner after a solo trip can remind each of you why you dig each other in the first place. As a bonus, if you find a favorite place when you’re alone, you can always bring your sweetie along another time.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">9. No drama</span><br />Sometimes, when you’re single, you wait until you’re dating someone before you take a vacation away, and these trips can either make or break a fledgling relationship. If things don’t go well, the entire trip can be a miserable, drama-filled time you’d love to forget. When you get good at traveling alone, you can stop waiting for “someone” to take on vacation. Instead, you can continue to go alone until someone really worthy comes along to help you make some brilliant new memories.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion:</span><br />1.

Today, the video sharing giant claims over 1 billion active users worldwide, and thousands of magnetic video content creators, called YouTubers or YouTube influencers, have risen to prominence in the wake of YouTube's exponential growth.<br /><br />The Rise Of YouTubers<br />As audiences continue abadoning television and other forms of traditional entertainment in favor of social media platforms and social interaction through apps, online channels, and networks, YouTube has attracted millions of engaged users who now watch over 4 billion videos each day and over 6 billion hours of videos each month. The platform's top YouTubers have both capitalized on and served as an impetus for this growth, drawing large audiences by creating content that is both entertaining and authentic while fostering influential relationships with their followers.<br />Why Brands Partner With Today's Top YouTubers<br /><br />The massive reach of social media influencers and the unique relationship YouTubers have cultivated with followers make partnering with today's top video content creators an effectively viable marketing channel for brands and advertisers looking to target millions of engaged consumers. Because the best YouTubers are able to organically integrate brand sponsored content (through product placements, unboxing videos, experiential videos, etc.) using some of the most popular YouTube video formats to create an authentic experience for subscribers, influencers marketing collaborations typically see far more engagement and higher ROIs than any other forms of advertising. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion:</span><br />1.Do you know the noun of youtuber before? What do you think about this? Do you think they are the celebrity and have the influence on the public?<br />2.Do you prefer to get the information from words or video? Why? What different for you?<br />3.Any youtuber channel you have subscribed? If yes, please share with you mate. If not, please share your favorite TV program.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=49">josh</a> — Mon Oct 23, 2017 5:05 pm</p><hr />
