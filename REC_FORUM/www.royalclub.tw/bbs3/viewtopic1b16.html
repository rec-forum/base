				<div class="content">Session 1:<br />Why are weddings so damn expensive?<br /><br />Please find video below the website.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/27044">https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/27044</a><!-- m --><br /><br />1. Do you believe that Wedding cost could destroys an ongoing marriage? Why or why not?<br />2. What is your wedding going to be (if you were married, how was it?)? Just keep it simple or the most luxurious one? Why? <br />3. Women insist that wedding is an once-in-a-lifetime even while mans say it’s only a ceremony, what do you think about it?<br />4. If you wanted to cost less for a wedding, what are things that you want to save? (guests. venue. food, photo or ring, etc.). please explain why.<br /><br />Session 2:<br />Which Jobs Robots Will Take First?<br />Researchers at the University of Oxford have predicted that the jobs in developing countries up to 47 percent could be automated in the coming two decades, mostly replaced by robots. But which of the professional jobs will be taken first by robots?<br />We can define robots as machine learning algorithms running on purpose-built platforms and they are trained to perform tasks that humans usually do. Let’s see how this technology could take the jobs and what jobs would be the first?<br />Doctors<br />According to UNDESA (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs) report, the present population of the world 7.5 billion is expected to reach 8.5 billion by 2030, 9.8 billion by 2050 and 11.2 billion by 2100. Doctors’ job would be one of the guaranteed jobs that robots will take away. There are many talented doctors, but still not sufficient enough to serve people and the good news is robots are capable enough to perform as a doctor. Robot treatments are currently in practice in US to spot early-stage skin cancers. Even some mobile app development companies in India are very enthusiastic to dig deeper in this area.<br />Commodity Salespeople (Ad Sales, Supplies, etc.)<br />Robots can even replace sales people and ensure higher productivity. For sales people: if you don’t put your special skills on sales, you could lose your job as machines are very much responsive and 24*7, so fight for your best.<br />Accountants &amp; Bookkeepers<br />Data processing was a job creator instead of what it was mistaken as job destroyer. But today machine learning–based accountants and bookkeepers are far better than their human counterparts. If your company hire such kind of machine employees, you can yield better results, but it will replace human employees. Today top obile app development companies Noida,India and other technology companies are much interested to go behind it. Robo-accounting is still in developing stage only and its performance in dealing with auditing, accounts payable and receivable, inventory control, and other accounting areas are breathtaking. There might be a big shake-up in auditing field because of this technology.<br />Middle Management<br />If your job is copying data from one excel column to another, robots could replace you. How special you may be in matrix, it will acquire your job, be ready to face it.<br />Report Writers, Journalists, Authors &amp; Announcers<br />I agree, writing is hard, but not report writing. Machine can read data, pattern match images or video and understand any sort of research material, so it can easily create research report. Today text-to-speech facility are common conveniences we are getting, but robots can take the responsibility.<br />Are you thinking that robot will hurt you? This technology may be good or bad for adapting, but there is nothing to get upset. But we have to accept new technology and profitability at the end. Man and machine partners may not save every job, but it is a clear way to taking the tech world to the next level.<br /><br />1. According your own opining what jobs will be taken first? If someone just happened to have majored in the field, is it essential for them to shift their jobs? if not, any strategies?<br />2. Is your job replaceable? Why or why not? How do you make if different?<br />3. What will you do in five years? Is it a goal or just an illusion? Please explain it.<br />4. How do you make plans practical and feasible? <br /><br />Saturday's meeting place: <br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />tel: 2255-8132<br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
