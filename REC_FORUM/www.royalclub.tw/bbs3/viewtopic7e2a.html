He started attacking the children and ran away after the driver yelled at him.<br />The man reportedly stabbed himself in the neck and subsequently died from the injuries.<br />The children are believed to be students at Caritas elementary school, a private Catholic institution in the city.<br />Japanese broadcaster NHK reports that police confirmed a young girl was among the fatalities, and later confirmed that a man in his 30s had also died due to his injuries.<br />Another 16 people, mostly children, are believed to have been injured in the attack. Earlier reports cited police saying the number of injured was 19.<br />In a televised statement, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe expressed “strong indignation” over the attack and offered his condolences to victims of what he described as a “harrowing incident.”<br />No motive for the attack has yet been established.<br />Violent attacks are rare in Japan, which has one of the lowest crime rates in the world. But the country has seen some high-profile killings, including the stabbing of 19 at a disabled home in 2016.<br /><br /><br />Discussion<br /><br />1. What’s wrong in this society?<br />2. What is his motivated you guess?<br />3. Should we find the killer’s parents to share the duty yet?<br />3. Do you think social media are another kind of killer machine?  <br />4. How can we prevent a similar situation happens again and again?<br /><br />/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////<br /><br /><br />Article2: Parents risk jail for raising children as vegans<br /><br />Doctors in Belgium have stated that raising children on a vegan diet is &quot;unethical&quot; and should be a criminal offence. Vegans refrain from consuming any animal products, including meat, eggs, dairy products, and other animal-derived substances. The Royal Academy of Medicine of Belgium has declared that veganism is &quot;unsuitable for unborn children, children, teenagers, and pregnant and lactating women&quot;. Professor Georges Casimir said vegan parenting qualifies as &quot;non-assistance to a person in danger,&quot; which is a criminal offence that carries a prison sentence of up to two years. He said children need &quot;higher requirements for protein and essential fatty acids&quot; and that these nutrients must be from animal products. <br />The animal rights group PETA reacted angrily to the ruling of the Belgian medical association. It rejected the ruling and called it &quot;ignorant codswallop&quot;. PETA spokeswoman Dawn Carr said: &quot;Nutritionists confirm that while a meat- and dairy-based diet is what strikes people down in adulthood (as it can lead to hardened arteries that cause stroke, brain aneurysms, and heart attacks) a well-planned vegan diet is perfect for babies and children.&quot; She added: &quot;Kids, including my own, thrive on a balanced vegan diet, but as with any dietary regime, it's the parents' responsibility to ensure their child is getting all the necessary nutrients.&quot; Around three per cent of Belgian children live in vegan families. <br /><br /><br />Discussion<br />1. What images are in your mind when you hear the word 'vegan'?<br />2. What do you think of a vegan diet?<br />3. Should governments be making diets a criminal offence?<br />4. Do we need to eat meat and other animal products?<br />5. Is a child really &quot;in danger&quot; if it eats no animal products?<br /><br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00 ~ 7:30 pm greetings &amp; free talk <br />7:30 ~ 8:15 pm guests introduced &amp; first session discussion <br />8:15 ~ 8:45 pm presentation, sharing the article &amp; other experiences <br />8:45 ~ 9:30 pm second session discussion<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />a minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
