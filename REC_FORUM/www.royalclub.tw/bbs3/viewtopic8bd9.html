			<div class="content">9/28(Sat.)Difference Between Being Alone and Being Lonely, Posted by koshal/Solar greenhouses generate electricity and grow crops at the same time(Host:Amy)<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Article 1:Difference Between Being Alone and Being Lonely, Posted by koshal </span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Being Alone vs Being Lonely</span><br />There is a difference between being alone and being lonely. Wait a minute! Are not being alone and being lonely one and the same thing? Do you not feel lonely when you are alone but feel happy when you are in between people you know? Well, to be frank, this was true at least in old times when people had time for leisure and social activities. People visited friends and relatives and knew what was going on in their surroundings. That was a time when being alone was considered a type of punishment and sending people to live their life in prisons made on islands was considered a harsh punishment. However, times have changed and with all the advancement and materialism, we have restricted our social activities to playing with all the modern gadgets and talking to friends we have on social networking sites rather than going out with friends in the city.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What does Being Alone mean?</span><br /><br />Being alone is a situation while being lonely can be known as a feeling. When a person is alone that means the person is by himself or herself. Also, being alone does not necessarily brings unhappiness. Being alone can be a choice someone makes.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What does Being Lonely mean?</span><br /><br />Being lonely is a feeling. Economic development has forced people to migrate from their rural surroundings and smaller towns to large cities in search of greener pastures. Though they do get better jobs and more money at their disposal, they now live in apartments where they hardly know their neighbors. This has led to a situation where people, despite not being alone, feel more and more lonely. They are lonely because of their social circle that is shrinking at a fast pace. Today people prefer to chat with unknown people on the net than giving a call to their real friends with the result that they are feeling lonelier than ever. This is why we see a proliferation of social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What is the difference between Being Alone and Being Lonely?</span><br /><br />The feeling of loneliness is also not felt by everyone on the same level. There are people who say that reading their favorite books is just great and they do not feel lonely as their books are their companions. On the other hand, you can find people who, despite living in the midst of their family members may feel lonely and remain depressed. Thus, loneliness is a feeling that some people feel much more than others.<br /><br />• Being alone and being lonely are two related but quite different concepts.<br />• Being alone is situation where there is no one around you while being lonely is a feeling.<br />• One can be all alone and not fee loneliness whereas some people may feel lonely despite being in the midst of their family and friends.]<br />• There was a time when living alone was considered as a form of punishment whereas today people are living alone in apartments out of their own volition and facing loneliness.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussions:</span><br /><br />1. Do you agree the sentence of the article,” Today people prefer to chat with unknown people on the net than giving a call to their real friends with the result that they are feeling lonelier than ever.”?<br />2. How do you conquer with being lonely? Join activities , call or chat friends via modern gadgets? <br />3. The feeling of loneliness is not the same level for everybody. What situation will make you feel lonely?<br />4. Will being alone make you fell loneliness or you enjoy it ?<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Article 2:Solar greenhouses generate electricity and grow crops at the same time.</span><br />November 4, 2017,by Jennifer Mcnulty, University of California - Santa Cruz <br /><br />The first crops of tomatoes and cucumbers grown inside electricity-generating solar greenhouses were as healthy as those raised in conventional greenhouses, signaling that &quot;smart&quot; greenhouses hold great promise for dual-use farming and renewable electricity production. &quot;We have demonstrated that 'smart greenhouses' can capture solar energy for electricity without reducing plant growth, which is pretty exciting,&quot; said Michael Loik, professor of environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and lead author on a paper that appears in the current issue of the American Geophysical Union's journal Earth's Future. Electricity-generating solar greenhouses utilize Wavelength-Selective Photovoltaic Systems (WSPVs), a novel technology that generates electricity more efficiently and at less cost than traditional photovoltaic systems. These greenhouses are outfitted with transparent roof panels embedded with a bright magenta luminescent dye that absorbs light and transfers energy to narrow photovoltaic strips, where electricity is produced. WSPVs absorb some of the blue and green wavelengths of light but let the rest through, allowing the plants to grow. WSPV technology was developed by coauthors Sue Carter and Glenn Alers, both professors of physics at UC Santa Cruz, who founded Soliculture in 2012 to bring the technology to market. <br /><br />Loik's team monitored photosynthesis and fruit production across 20 varieties of tomatoes, cucumbers, lemons, limes, peppers, strawberries, and basil grown in magenta glasshouses at two locations on campus and one in Watsonville, California. &quot;Eighty percent of the plants weren't affected, while 20 percent actually grew better under the magenta windows,&quot; said Loik. Tomatoes and cucumbers are among the top greenhouse-produced crops worldwide, he said. In additional experiments, small water savings were associated with tomato photosynthesis inside the magenta glasshouses. &quot;Plants required 5 percent less water to grow the same amount as in more conventional glasshouses,&quot; he said. &quot;I thought the plants would grow more slowly, because it's darker under these pink panels. The color of the light makes it like being on the Red Planet,&quot; said Loik. &quot;Plants are sensitive not just to the intensity of light but also to color. But it turns out the plants grow just as well. &quot;Reducing the energy consumed by greenhouses has become a priority as the global use of greenhouses for food production has increased six-fold over the past 20 years to more than 9 million acres today—roughly twice the size of New Jersey, according to Loik. &quot;It's big and getting bigger,&quot; he said. &quot;Canada relies heavily on greenhouses for vegetable production, and their use is growing in China, too.&quot; <br /><br />Plastic greenhouses are becoming popular for small-scale commercial farming, as well as for household food production, he added. Greenhouses use electricity to control temperature and power fans, lights, and other monitoring systems. &quot;This technology has the potential to take greenhouses offline,&quot; said Loik, who specializes in climate change, plant physiology, water resources, and sustainable technologies. Cost per panel of WSPV technology is 65 cents per watt—about 40 percent less than the per-watt cost of traditional silicon-based photovoltaic cells.&quot;If greenhouses generate electricity on site, that reduces the need for an outside source, which helps lower greenhouse gas emissions even more,&quot; said Loik. &quot;We're moving toward self-sustaining greenhouses.&quot; <br /><br /><br />Discussions:<br />1. According to the report of今周刊/台灣太陽能兆元商機爆發, Taiwan farmers use solar energy to grow bitter gourds successfully. Do you think it’s a kind of revolution of farming?<br />3. The global use of greenhouse for food production has increased 6-fold over the past 20 years because it saves energy. Should we promote it largely here?                  <br />3. Green house use electricity to control temperature and power fans, lights and monitor other system and it saves water. Will it help reduce the dependence for the gasoline?<br /><br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00 ~ 7:30 pm greetings &amp; free talk<br />7:30 ~ 8:15 pm guests introduced &amp; first session discussion<br />8:15 ~ 8:45 pm presentation, sharing the article &amp; other experiences<br />8:45 ~ 9:30 pm second session discussion<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven,<br />板橋民生路二段237 號,<br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30,<br />a minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文<br /><br />Royal 三峽 , Royal new branch information,<br />Every Monday evening: 8:00pm- 10pm: 摩斯漢堡 北大特區 土城區學成路712號, next to the park.<br />Please keep contact with President Ophelia.</div>
