Traditionally we believe &quot;people often think that they need to be married to be happy.&quot; However, this new study finding is opposite: Being married doesn't make you happier than staying single. What do you think about the result of the study? Or why single people can have a happy life?<br /><br />2.The researcher said that &quot;if you're unhappy to begin with, getting married is not likely to drastically change that.'' Do you agree with this quote and why? <br /><br />3.If you are a parent, would you encourage your children to get married? Or what goes through your mind when your parents ask you to get married?<br /><br />4.Taiwanese and other countries' governments have taken actions and set incentives to increase marriage rate and birth rate, do you agree with that and why? <br /><br />5. If the study result gets published widely on media, what trends or thoughts will happen to younger generation?<br /><br />Optional topic:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZZ6QB5TSfk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZZ6QB5TSfk</a><!-- m --><br /><br />#2 <br /><br />GAME NIGHT FUN !!!<br />We will play Taboo game (modified) this coming Saturday night!!!  <br />Come to have fun, exercise your brain, and of course practice your English skills!
