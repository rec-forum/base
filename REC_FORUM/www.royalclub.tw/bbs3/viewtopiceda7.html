According to AFP, the company announced this month that it will use artificial intelligence to detect when a user is about to post offensive content, and issue a caution by asking the user: “Are you sure you want to post this?”<br />“This intervention gives people a chance to reflect and undo their comment,” said Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, adding that in early tests, they have “found that the feature encourages some people to undo their comment and share something less hurtful.” The company will also start testing “Restrict,” a feature aimed at rendering abusive posts visible only to the sender.<br />Instagram has over a billion users across the world, including 7.4 million users in Taiwan. However, bullying is not the only problem the social network is currently facing, as there have been calls for regulations over hate speech, fake news and “deepfake” technology that fabricates content easily mistaken for the real thing.<br /><br />Question<br />1.How can we stop online bullying? <br />2.how to protect yourself from online bullying?<br />3.What can parents do to prevent cyberbully ? <br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Bad day- Daniel Powter <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH476CxJxfg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH476CxJxfg</a><!-- m --> <br /><br />Where is the moment when we needed the most?<br />You kick up the leaves, and the magic is lost<br />They tell me your blue sky's faded to gray<br />They tell me your passion's gone away<br />And I don't need no carrying on<br /><br />Stand in the line just to hit a new low<br />You're faking a smile with the coffee to go<br />You tell me your life's been way off line<br />You're falling to pieces every time<br />And I don't need no carrying on<br /><br />'Cause you had a bad day<br />You're taking one down<br />You sing a sad song just to turn it around<br />You say you don't know<br />You tell me don't lie<br />You work at a smile, and you go for a ride<br />You had a bad day<br />The camera don't lie<br />You're coming back down, and you really don't mind<br />You had a bad day<br />You had a bad day<br /><br />Well you need a blue sky holiday<br />The point is they laugh at what you say<br />And I don't need no carrying on<br /><br />You had a bad day<br />You're taking one down<br />You sing a sad song just to turn it around<br />You say you don't know<br />You tell me don't lie<br />You work at a smile, and you go for a ride<br />You had a bad day<br />The camera don't lie<br />You're coming back down and you really don't mind<br />You had a bad day<br /><br />Sometimes the system goes on the blink, and the whole thing it turns out<br />Wrong<br />You might not make it back and you know that you could be well, oh, that<br />Strong<br />And I'm not wrong<br /><br />So where is the passion when you need it the most?<br />Oh, you and I<br />You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost<br /><br />'Cause you had a bad day<br />You're taking one down<br />You sing a sad song just to turn it around<br />You say you don't know<br />You tell me don't lie<br />You work at a smile and you go for a ride<br />You had a bad day<br />You see what you like<br />And how does it feel one more time?<br />You had a bad day<br />You had a bad day (had a bad day, had a bad day, had a bad day) <br /><br />Question<br />1.How do you make yourself feel better after a bad day? <br />2.How do you turn a bad mood into a good mood? <br />3.How do you help someone having a bad day? <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00 ~ 7:30 pm greetings &amp; free talk <br />7:30 ~ 8:15 pm guests introduced &amp; first session discussion <br />8:15 ~ 8:45 pm presentation, sharing the article &amp; other experiences <br />8:45 ~ 9:30 pm second session discussion<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />a minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
