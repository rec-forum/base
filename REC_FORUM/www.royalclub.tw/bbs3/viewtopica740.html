At the time, average salaries for public sector workers were lower than those in the private sector.<br />The government began to phase out the 18 percent rate in 1995. <br />Under current rules, payments made by retirees and public sector workers into the national fund prior to 1995 are still covered by the 18 percent rate, regardless of the size of a recipient's monthly pension.<br />The committee had decided to choose between two different figures, NT$25,000 and NT$32,160, for people who made less than this amount per month to retain the 18 percent preferential rate. <br />Minister Without Portfolio Lin Wan-yi, the committee's deputy convener, explained the decision to go with the larger figure, saying that it had received majority backing from different sectors of society and the economy. <br />There were about 3000 to 4000 civil servants, teachers and military personnel who received monthly pensions of less than NT$30,000, Lin said<br />Given the minimal increase of people who would qualify for the preferential rate should the committee opt for the higher salary minimum, Lin said that the committee chose to go with NT$32,160 to &quot;look out for the underprivileged.&quot; <br />While the Ministry of National Defense is currently working on a separate pension reform plan for military personnel, Lin expressed hope that the salary floor could be the same for all public sector workers. <br />Phasing Things Out <br />According to Lin, those currently receiving an 18 percent preferential rate would be phased out completely in six years at the latest. Those who received their pension as a lump sum will see their rates reduced from 18 percent to 6 percent in 6 years' time. <br /><br />Last week the Examination Yuan, which oversees civil servant regulations, proposed to reduce the income replacement ratio — the percentage of working income that an individual needs to maintain the same standard of living in retirement — from 80 percent to 70 percent for civil servants who have worked 35 years or more. <br />The pension reform committee said the ratio would be lowered first from 80 percent to 75 percent, before gradually lowering it to the intended 60 percent. <br />The committee has also reportedly raised the amount of death benefit a dependent of a civil servant can receive from one third of the monthly pension to half of the monthly pension. <br />Once the president decides on about the proposed salary base of NT$32160, this would become the fixed number for the pension reform plan going forward, Lin said<br /><br />Q1.

Why or Why not?<br />Q3.What is a reasonable income replacement ratio for retired public sector workers: 80%, 75%, 70%, 65%, or 60%?<br />Q4. What is your opinion about the pension reform? <br />Q5.

Alice and Neil discuss where they lie on the introvert/extrovert spectrum. If you are an introvert you're in good company; Barack Obama, JK Rowling and many more eminent and thoughtful people are introverts.<br />This week's question<br />Who first used the term 'extrovert'?

I'm Neil…<br />Alice<br />And I'm Alice.<br />Neil<br />So Alice how did you spend Saturday night?<br />Alice<br />Curled up on the sofa with a good book. You?<br />Neil<br />I went out on the town. Met some friends, had a few drinks, then went on to a party.<br /><br />Alice<br />Well that illustrates the difference between us – you're an extrovert. And I'm… not. And where we are on the spectrum between introvert and extrovert is the subject of today's show.<br /><br />Neil<br />So would you call yourself an introvert, Alice?<br />Alice<br />No, I'm an ambivert, which means a mixture of introvert and extrovert.<br />Neil<br />Well, whichever you are, Alice, staying in on your own on a Saturday night is pretty boring!<br />Alice<br />Not to me. And you shouldn't be so judgemental, Neil. You're reflecting the general view that people seem to have these days, that being an introvert is somehow less valuable than being an extrovert. Introverts have many valuable qualities. They're reflective – that means thoughtful – and have inner resources. In other words, they don't rely on other people to enjoy themselves.<br />Neil<br />OK, well if you're feeling reflective at the moment, how about answering today's quiz question?<br />Alice<br />OK.<br />Neil<br />Can you tell me: who first used the term 'extrovert'? Was it…<br />a) Sigmund Freud?<br />b) Friedrich Nietzsche?<br />Or c) Carl Jung?<br />Alice<br />I think the answer is c) Carl Jung.<br />Neil<br />Well, we'll find out if you got the answer right or not later in the show. But before we get there, let's listen to Lisa Kaenzig, researcher and Associate Dean for William Smith College, New York State, telling us a bit more about what being an introvert typically means.<br />INSERT<br />Lisa Kaenzig, researcher and Associate Dean for William Smith College, New York State<br />Introverts are people of any age who really get their energy from within themselves. And who often have sort of a running dialogue in their head going on thinking before they're talking, like to have a little more time to think through things before they're commenting on them or answering a question, need some time to recharge their batteries by being by themselves, and enjoy having alone time.<br />Neil<br />Lisa Kaenzig there – who says that introverts think about what they're going to say before they say it.<br />Alice<br />Do you do that, Neil?<br />Neil<br />Nope!<br />Alice<br />You should try it sometime. Now, Lisa also talks about the different ways people recharge their batteries – introverts tend to need time alone to regain their strength and energy when they're feeling drained – or very tired – whereas extroverts often prefer to recharge by being with other people.<br />Neil<br />So introverts create their energy internally – from within themselves – and extroverts recharge from being with other people.<br />Alice<br />Exactly. But in some situations, for example at school or in the workplace, things can be made suitable for – extroverts. Extroverts typically love being with others – in a big class or an open plan office – where there's a lot going on. They enjoy the external stimulation. But introverts can find these big, noisy environments uncomfortable.<br /><br />Neil<br />I can see that. And these days, people are wild about group work and brainstorming – job ads frequently ask if you are a people person, a team player … and so on.<br />Alice<br />That's right. Introverts like to work alone or in small groups and need a quieter space to perform well. Let's listen now to Dr Peter Aloka, a researcher and psychologist in Kenya. He's been working with introvert teenage mothers in Bondo who are returning to school after having their babies. And schools are being asked to develop new strategies to support their learning.<br />INSERT<br />Dr Peter Aloka, psychologist, Bondo, Kenya<br />Introverts might find it easier working in groups, but with smaller groups, and they work in pairs with extroverts… The teachers should design a classroom for all the students too, to contribute. Whenever a teacher is teaching a question in class let them allow for wait time for students to process the information before answering the question. Just for people to think through that question. Thinking, pairing, and sharing: those three strategies will help the introverts to speak out.<br />Neil<br />Dr Peter Aloka is talking about some very clever pairing there. If you put two introverts together they might not say anything. An extrovert is likely to talk, but won't intimidate – or overpower – their introvert partner as much as a large group would.<br />Alice<br />So the idea is that with fewer people – in a small group or a pair – the introvert will have enough time and space to express their ideas. And because their ideas have been thought through – or carefully considered – , their contribution is likely to be worth waiting for. So… Think. Pair. Share.<br />Neil<br />Hmm. I like that. OK, so I think it's time to share the answer to today's quiz question. I asked: who first used the term ‘extrovert'? Was it…<br />a) Sigmund Freud?<br />b) Friedrich Nietzsche?<br />Or c) Carl Jung?<br />Alice<br />I said… Carl Jung.<br />Neil<br />And you were… right, Alice. So thinking things through really works! ‘Introvert' and ‘extrovert' are the two basic personality types according to the theories of the 20th-century Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung. According to these theories, an introvert is a person whose interest lies with their own feelings and thoughts, in contrast to an extrovert, whose interest lies with other people and the outside world.<br />Alice<br />OK. Now, let's hear the words we learned today:<br />ambivert<br />reflective<br />inner resources<br />recharge their batteries<br />drained<br />intimidate<br />thought through<br />Neil<br />Well, that's the end of this edition of 6 Minute English.
