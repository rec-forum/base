				<div class="content"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">What Is Green Power</span><br /></span><br />The U.S. energy supply is composed of a wide variety of energy resources; however, not all energy resources have the same environmental benefits and costs.<br /><br />Green power is a subset of renewable energy and represents those renewable energy resources and technologies that provide the highest environmental benefit. EPA defines green power as electricity produced from solar, wind, geothermal, biogas, eligible biomass, and low-impact small hydroelectric sources. Customers often buy green power for its zero emissions profile and carbon footprint reduction benefits.<br /><br />Renewable energy includes resources that rely on fuel sources that restore themselves over short periods of time and do not diminish. Such fuel sources include the sun, wind, moving water, organic plant and waste material (eligible biomass), and the earth's heat (geothermal). Although the impacts are small, some renewable energy technologies can have an impact on the environment. For example, large hydroelectric resources can have environmental trade-offs on such issues as fisheries and land use.<br /><br />Conventional power includes the combustion of fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and oil) and the nuclear fission of uranium. Fossil fuels have environmental costs from mining, drilling, or extraction, and emit greenhouse gases and air pollution during combustion. Although nuclear power generation emits no greenhouse gases during power generation, it does require mining, extraction, and long-term radioactive waste storage.<br />The following graphic depicts how EPA defines different types of energy resources based on their relative environmental benefits.<br /><br /><br /><br />Q1 :  Do you know the power policy in Taiwan?<br />Q2 :  Do you want green power but high electricity fee? <br /> <br /><br />How Do Wind Turbines Work?<br />Wind turbines operate on a simple principle. The energy in the wind turns two or three propeller-like blades around a rotor. The rotor is connected to the main shaft, which spins a generator to create electricity. Click on the image to see an animation of wind at work.<br /><br /> 	 <br /><br />So how do wind turbines make electricity? Simply stated, a wind turbine works the opposite of a fan. Instead of using electricity to make wind, like a fan, wind turbines use wind to make electricity. The wind turns the blades, which spin a shaft, which connects to a generator and makes electricity. View the wind turbine animation to see how a wind turbine works or take a look inside.<br />Wind is a form of solar energy and is a result of the uneven heating of the atmosphere by the sun, the irregularities of the earth's surface, and the rotation of the earth. Wind flow patterns and speeds vary greatly across the United States and are modified by bodies of water, vegetation, and differences in terrain. Humans use this wind flow, or motion energy, for many purposes: sailing, flying a kite, and even generating electricity.<br />The terms wind energy or wind power describe the process by which the wind is used to generate mechanical power or electricity. Wind turbines convert the kinetic energy in the wind into mechanical power. This mechanical power can be used for specific tasks (such as grinding grain or pumping water) or a generator can convert this mechanical power into electricity.<br />Types of Wind Turbines<br />Modern wind turbines fall into two basic groups: the horizontal-axis variety, as shown in the photo to the far right, and the vertical-axis design, like the eggbeater-style Darrieus model pictured to the immediate right, named after its French inventor. Horizontal-axis wind turbines typically either have two or three blades. These three-bladed wind turbines are operated &quot;upwind,&quot; with the blades facing into the wind.<br />Wind turbines can be built on land or offshore in large bodies of water like oceans and lakes. The U.S. Department of Energy is funding efforts that will make innovative offshore wind technology available in U.S. waters.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">Policies to Support Solar Power Deployment</span></span><br />As global electricity demand increases, governments are designing and implementing policies to scale up and catalyze renewable energy, which now meets 22% of global electricity demand (REN21 2014). Solar technologies are a critical component of this expanded deployment, and they have experienced unprecedented growth in recent years. Solar prices have decreased significantly over the last decade (REN21 2014) and in 2013, new capacity installation of solar electricity from photovoltaics (PV) surpassed all other renewable energy technologies worldwide—excluding hydropower—with 39 gigawatts installed that year. Concentrating solar thermal power, although it still represents a fairly nascent market, also continues to expand as installed capacity increased by 36% in 2013 compared to 2012. In addition to meeting energy demand in an increasingly cost-effective manner, solar deployment can also support critical economic, social, and environmental development goals (Flavin and Hull Aeck, n.d.).<br />Despite significant growth of solar markets in many countries, barriers to solar deployment still exist. Common critical barriers (Brown and Muller 2011; REN21 2014; and U.S. Dept. of Energy 2014) include:<br />•	Lack of consistent policy signals, which can create uncertainty in markets<br />•	Restrictive and time-consuming regulatory and permitting processes<br />•	Technical or infrastructural grid integration challenges<br />•	Concerns of utilities related to integration of distributed or variable power in the grid<br />•	Higher cost of solar technologies (real or perceived), especially in relation to fossil fuel subsidies<br />•	Lack of affordable financing<br />•	Need for skilled labor to support solar technology deployment, including system design, installation, and ongoing operation and maintenance.<br /><br />Q1 :  Do you support the solar power policy?<br />Q2 :  What’s the problems of the power policy in Taiwan ?</div>
