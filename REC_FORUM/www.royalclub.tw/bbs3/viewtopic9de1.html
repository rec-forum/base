			<div class="content">Article 1: Coffee drinkers live longer – perhaps<br />By Smitha Mundasad Health reporter, BBC News <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bbc.com/news/health-40567047">http://www.bbc.com/news/health-40567047</a><!-- m --><br />Drinking three cups of coffee a day may help you live longer, according to a study of almost half a million people from 10 European countries. <br />The research, published in the journal the Annals of Internal Medicine, suggests an extra cup of coffee could lengthen a person's lifespan - even if it is decaffeinated. <br />But sceptical experts point out it is impossible to say for sure that it is the coffee that is having a protective effect, rather than say, a more healthy lifestyle in coffee drinkers. <br />They say there is no need to reach for that extra cup of coffee just yet. <br />What does the new study claim? <br />Researchers from the International Agency for Research on Cancer and Imperial College London say they have found that drinking more coffee is linked to a lower risk of death - particularly for heart diseases and diseases of the gut. <br />They came to their conclusions after analysing data of healthy people over the age of 35 from 10 EU countries. <br />They asked them once at the beginning of the study how much coffee they tended to drink and then looked at deaths over an average of 16 years. <br />If true - by just how much could a cup of coffee lengthen lifespan? <br />Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, from the University of Cambridge, analyses the public understanding of risk and says that if the estimated reductions in death really were down to coffee, then an extra cup of coffee every day would extend the life of a man by around three months and a woman by around a month on average. <br />But despite the sheer scale of the study, it is by no means perfect and cannot prove that coffee beans are the magic ingredient. <br />Why you do not need to rush out and buy more coffee just yet<br />Frustratingly for coffee fiends, the findings really are not as clear-cut as they might first seem. <br />That's because the study could not take every factor into account - clouding how certain one can be about coffee's effects. <br />For example, it did not look at how much coffee drinkers earned in comparison with non-coffee drinkers. It might be that people who can afford three cups of coffee a day are richer and that extra money, in some way, helps protect their health. <br />It might be that people who drank three cups of coffee a day spent more time socialising and that in turn may have boosted their wellbeing. <br />And even if they were to be certain it was the coffee that was responsible, not every risk improved.<br />The researchers found higher coffee-drinking was linked to a higher rate of ovarian cancer in women, for example. <br />And although the paper looked at a lot of people, the researchers excluded anyone who had diabetes, heart attacks or strokes at the beginning of the study. <br />So it doesn't tell us much about the risks or benefits of drinking coffee if people are unwell. <br />It is also possible some of those people became unwell while having their regular brews. <br />Is coffee good for you? <br />Previous studies have shown conflicting and often contradictory results. <br />For many people, experience suggests that drinks containing caffeine can temporarily make us feel more alert. <br />But caffeine affects some people more than others, and the effects can vary from person to person. <br />NHS experts have not set limits for coffee in the general population but they do say that pregnant women should avoid drinking more than 200mg of caffeine a day.<br />They say this is because coffee might increase the chance of the baby being born too small. Too much caffeine may also increase the risk of miscarriage.<br />And, of course, caffeine is not just found in coffee. <br />The 200mg caffeine limit could be reached by having two mugs of tea and a can of cola, for example, or two cups of instant coffee. <br />There was also recently the case of a US teen who, it's thought, may have died from drinking too many caffeinated drinks too quickly. <br />How could we ever be sure whether coffee makes you live longer? <br />The most rigorous scientific way to be certain that coffee could make you live longer would be to force thousands of people all over the world to drink it regularly while preventing many thousands of otherwise similar people from ever drinking coffee. <br />Scientists would then have to monitor every other aspect of their life - what else they ate and drank, how much they earned, how much exercise they did, for example. <br />That's a study that is never likely to take place.<br />So for now, some experts say, instead of putting all your bets on coffee being good for you, you could instead do something that has been proven to extend life - take a brisk, 20-minute walk to the nearest coffee shop - whether you order a cup or not. <br />Discussion:<br />1.	Do you believe that coffee drinkers live longer? Why?<br />2.	What are the advantages and disadvantages of drinking coffee?<br />3.	Why is coffee so popular around the world?<br />4.	Do you prefer coffee or tea? Why?<br />5.	What do you drink to stay healthy?<br /><br /><br />Article 2: Married People Have Lower Levels of Stress Hormones, Study Says<br />By Elana Glowatz<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.medicaldaily.com/married-people-have-lower-levels-stress-hormones-study-says-411108">http://www.medicaldaily.com/married-peo ... ays-411108</a><!-- m --><br />If you want to stress less, try getting married, because apparently it will lower your levels of a stress hormone.<br />That’s according to a study in Psychoneuroendocrinology, which says married people they analyzed had less cortisol than people who were not married — including people who were never married and people who were separated, divorced or widowed.<br />And cortisol is important because although it has other functions, your body releases the hormone when you are under stress. High cortisol levels have been linked to mental illnesses like anxiety and depression as well as the progression of certain medical conditions, among other issues.<br />Read: How Marriage Makes Men More Charitable<br />“Married people tend to be healthier than both the previously … and never married, but the mechanisms through which this occurs remain unclear,” the study notes. “Research has increasingly focused on how psychological stress experienced by unmarried versus married individuals may differentially impact physiological systems related to health.”<br />According to Carnegie Mellon University, in addition to being less healthy than their married counterparts, single people have been shown to experience more psychological stress, and the study findings support that idea.<br />There were other stressful differences between the three groups, which together numbered almost 600 people. The wedded ones also had “a more rapid decline in cortisol through the afternoon hours” compared to those who were always single, the study says. And higher stress levels produced higher cortisol levels in the people who were previously married as opposed to the currently wed and the other singles.<br />The fast decline reduces a person’s risk of heart disease and increases the chances of surviving cancer, Carnegie Mellon said.<br />Researchers have long documented the positives and negatives of marriage. That includes its effects on both health and social factors. One study looked at how people’s views of marriage correlated with the amount of time they spent volunteering, while other researchers have found that bad relationships can be linked to a higher risk of heart disease, a slower recovery for illness and overall poor health, according to Live Science.<br />“These data provide important insight into the way in which our intimate social relationships can get under the skin to influence our health,” laboratory director and co-author Sheldon Cohen said in the Carnegie Mellon statement.<br />Discussion:<br />1.	Why do married people tend to be healthier than both the previously and never married?<br />2.	What are the positive and negative effects of marriage on health?<br />3.	What are the advantages and disadvantages of being single?<br />4.	How do your social relationships affect your health?<br />5.	Is marriage forever?<br />6.	What do people need to do to stay happily married?<br /><br />Saturday's meeting place: <br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />tel: 2255-8132<br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
