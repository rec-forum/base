			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Host : Josh</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Article 1 - Is live streaming your life good business or dangerous?</span><br /><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-39778550" class="postlink">http://www.bbc.com/news/business-39778550</a><br /><br />Live streaming is becoming big business, with millions of people around the world broadcasting the minutiae of their daily lives in real time to adoring fans - and making small fortunes in the process. But is it safe?<br /><br />Samantha Firth, a 21-year-old nanny living in Chicago, walks to the subway with her friend. So far, so ordinary.<br />But she is simultaneously broadcasting her 15-minute journey live via her mobile to thousands of avid followers.<br />&quot;I love you... you guys are the best,&quot; she exclaims, before heading onto the subway and zooming the camera in on a spot on her forehead.<br /><br />It used to be that only film stars would be famous, but thanks to reality TV, YouTube and bloggers, anyone can have their &quot;fifteen minutes&quot; of fame, as Andy Warhol predicted.<br /><br />The proliferation of live broadcasting tools, pioneered by Meerkat several years ago and followed by the likes of Periscope, Facebook, YouTube and others, has given many young people the chance to broadcast every aspect of their lives - whether they're brushing their hair in their bedroom or out dancing with friends.<br /><br />In China alone, the entertainment live streaming market is valued at £5bn, according to Credit Suisse.<br />And in the US, 63% of 18-34 year-olds are watching live content and 42% creating it, finds a study by UBS Evidence Lab.<br /><br />But for many like Ms Firth, this isn't just narcissistic fun, it's a cash cow.<br />She joined Live.me - owned by China's Cheetah Mobile - eight months ago after moving from Sydney to Chicago. The live-in nanny has since become one of the most popular broadcasters on the site, amassing 350,000 fans.<br /><br />These devotees bombard her with virtual gifts - animated stickers that can be converted into &quot;diamonds&quot; and then real money - helping her pull in about $21,000 (£16,300) a month.<br /><br />&quot;Coming from a different country it has been difficult to make friends, but this app has allowed me to connect with people who have the same interests,&quot; she says of her reasons for joining.<br /><br />&quot;I spend most of my free time broadcasting because it's where most of my friends are.&quot;<br />She is keen to portray a candid version of herself, pimples and all.<br />&quot;I don't wear make-up, I wear sweatshirts and sweatpants,&quot; she says. &quot;Sometimes I cry when someone says something hurtful on a broadcast.&quot;<br /><br />Like Live.me, live streaming platform YouNow enables these citizen broadcasters to make money from fans sending them virtual gifts. Fans of some streaming sites can also subscribe monthly to their favourite live streamers.<br /><br />It's been a real moneyspinner for the top broadcasters, who can earn up to $200,000 (£155,000) a year.<br />Singer Emma McGann, 26, broadcasts live from her studio in Coventry, England, for three to six hours every day. She says her live streams attract about 5-10,000 unique views.<br /><br />YouNow not only provides her with a good salary - she earns £2,000-3,000 a month via the channel - but it has helped her gain exposure for her music.<br />&quot;It enabled me to get a single in the iTunes chart,&quot; she says. &quot;It's also a great testing ground for new material.&quot;<br />&quot;I like the live element. I like to interact with the audience and take song requests.&quot;<br />Fans can also speak to her over the internet.<br /><br />While many brands are already running their own live streaming sessions, We Are Social head of strategy Harvey Cossell believes there are opportunities for brands to capitalise on live streaming by co-creating with individuals who have already amassed a loyal audience.<br />The success of such collaborations in the social gaming world, on sites such as Twitch, are a case in point.<br />&quot;They would need to identify those people that represent a similar set of values to the brand in question and then find creative ways to partner with them in the production of their content,&quot; he advises.<br /><br />The challenge, he warns, is one of authenticity.<br />&quot;It's always better for brands either to partner with the right person, or do nothing at all.&quot;<br /><br />Some researchers are forecasting that the live streaming business will be worth $70bn globally by 2021.<br />But for all its engagement value and monetisation potential, you only have to search online to see that live streaming has its dark side.<br />Earlier this year, 12-year-old Katelyn Nicole Davis took her own life and broadcast it live on Live.me, while there have been many reports about paedophiles watching live streaming of child sex abuse.<br /><br />&quot;Live streaming apps and sites can expose young people to graphic and distressing content and can leave them vulnerable to bullying and online harassment,&quot; an NSPCC [National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children] spokesman tells the BBC.<br />&quot;Worryingly, live chat can also be used by groomers to target young people who may be manipulated into sending sexual images and videos.&quot;<br />Khudor Annous, head of marketing and partnerships at Live.me, says the company has a number of safeguards, including a facial recognition tool that can supposedly spot anyone who's under the age of 13 on the app.<br /><br />&quot;If they are in fact under the age of 13, then we ban the account,&quot; says Mr Annous.<br />&quot;We have also provided users with reporting tools to report a channel if they identify a child in the app. We're typically able to evaluate reports within a couple of hours depending on daily volume.&quot;<br /><br />As for grooming, he says: &quot;Every user has the ability to report any suspicious behaviour before, or any violations of our community guidelines. We also work with the FBI and local law enforcement agencies around the globe to ensure the safety of our community.&quot;<br /><br />But there are also concerns that the broadcasters are themselves exploiting young people.<br />Clinical psychologist Linda Blair describes the rise of young people live streaming as &quot;very sad&quot;.<br />She adds: &quot;It's an indication of loneliness. They might temporarily feel great but it's only a distraction.&quot;<br />But with millions of people already using live streaming platforms, including Facebook Live, we can expect the number of everyday broadcasters to continue growing.<br /><br />&quot;I see live streaming following a path similar to social networking, where at first it started as a place for people to connect with each other but eventually evolved into a powerful platform for advertising, marketing, and publishing,&quot; says Paul Verna, principal analyst at eMarketer.<br />Mr Cossell also believes that live video will expand into other formats.<br />&quot;It will begin to harness emerging technologies such as 360-video and virtual reality more readily,&quot; he says.<br /><br />&quot;Live streaming is clearly here to stay.&quot;<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion:</span><br />Q1. Why live streaming is becoming popular recently? Would you like to try it?<br />Q2. Why people give virtual gifts or money to the popular broadcasters?<br />Q3. Is live streaming your life good business or dangerous?<br />Q4. What will you do if you have your own live channel?<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Article 2 - Friends at Work? Not So Much</span><br /><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/06/opinion/sunday/adam-grant-friends-at-work-not-so-much.html" class="postlink">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/06/opinion/sunday/adam-grant-friends-at-work-not-so-much.html</a><br /><br />ONCE, work was a major source of friendships. We took our families to company picnics and invited our colleagues over for dinner. Now, work is a more transactional place. We go to the office to be efficient, not to form bonds. We have plenty of productive conversations but fewer meaningful relationships.<br /><br />In 1985, about half of Americans said they had a close friend at work; by 2004, this was true for only 30 percent. And in nationally representative surveys of American high school seniors, the proportion who said it was very important to find a job where they could make friends dropped from 54 percent in 1976, to 48 percent in 1991, to 41 percent in 2006.<br /><br />We may start companies with our friends, but we don’t become friends with our co-workers. “We are not only ‘bowling alone,’ ” Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor at Stanford, observes, “we are increasingly ‘working alone.’ ”<br /><br />Focusing our friendship efforts outside work isn’t the norm around the world. In surveys across three countries, Americans reported inviting 32 percent of their closest colleagues to their homes, compared with 66 percent in Poland and 71 percent in India. Americans have gone on vacation with 6 percent of their closest co-workers, versus 25 percent in Poland and 45 percent in India.<br /><br />It’s not that Americans are less concerned with relationships overall. We’re social creatures outside work, yet the office interaction norm tends to be polite but impersonal. Some people think pleasantries have no place in professional meetings.<br /><br />In a study led by the social psychologist Jeffrey Sanchez-Burks, Anglo-American, Mexican and Mexican-American participants watched a four-minute video of two people working together. Shortly after, the Americans generally remembered just as much as the Mexicans and Mexican-Americans about the task, but much less about the social interaction. Anglo-Americans struggled to remember the socioemotional aspects, such as smiling, handshaking and discussions about movies and weekend plans. In other studies, Americans were less likely to notice subtleties in communication when a message was described as having been sent from a manager at a large company than when the same message was supposedly sent from a friend. There was no such discrepancy between the professional and personal among people from China or South Korea.<br /><br />Why are Americans so determined to get down to business?<br /><br />The economic explanation is that long-term employment has essentially vanished: Instead of spending our careers at one organization, we expect to jump ship every few years. Since we don’t plan to stick around, we don’t invest in the same way. We view co-workers as transitory ties, greeting them with arms-length civility while reserving real camaraderie for outside work. At best, as the movie “Fight Club” termed our conversation partners on airplanes, colleagues become “single-serving friends.”<br /><br />Some observers blame the rise of flextime and virtual work. When more people are working remotely, we have fewer chances for the face-to-face encounters that are so critical to companionship. But a comprehensive analysis of 46 studies of over 12,000 employees demonstrated that as long as people were in the office for at least two and a half days per week, “telecommuting had no generally detrimental effects on the quality of workplace relationships.”<br /><br />This doesn’t rule out the impact of technological advances. When we’re constantly connected with old friends on social media — and we can travel to visit them anytime — why bother making new ones? With 24/7 connectivity, we face a growing time famine, where the pressure to get work done may eclipse the desire to socialize.<br /><br />But how you react to this time famine might depend on your religion and your sex. In an experiment, Professor Sanchez-Burks randomly assigned people to dress and act professionally or casually, and then tracked their mimicry of a specific interpersonal cue. When Protestant men dressed professionally and solved a business case, they mimicked this social cue at half the rate of those who wore Hawaiian garb and generated vacation ideas. The attire and task had no impact on women and non-Protestant men: They caught the cues regardless of what they were wearing and doing.<br /><br />The sociologist Max Weber classically argued that the Protestant Reformation had a peculiar effect on American work. At the dawn of the Protestant Reformation, Martin Luther preached that hard work in any occupation was a meaningful duty — a calling from God. John Calvin took this idea a step further, arguing that people should avoid socializing while working, as attention to relationships and emotions would distract them from productively fulfilling God’s will. Over the generations, these Calvinist teachings influenced Protestants, who came to view social considerations as inappropriate and inefficient in the workplace. Protestant men were especially susceptible, as they were expected and socialized to focus on productivity. For much of the 20th century, American workplaces were largely designed by Protestant men.<br /><br />Yet in recent years, America has become noticeably less Protestant, dropping from roughly 70 percent in the 1950s to 57 percent in 1985, 49 percent in 2005, and 37 percent last year, according to Gallup. The proportion of Protestant chief executives has declined, too. Why, then, does the Protestant ethic persist?<br /><br />A generational shift has reinforced the transactional mind-set in American workplaces, regardless of sex and religion. Although the evidence is strong that different generations generally want similar things out of work, the value placed on leisure time has increased steadily. When the psychologist Jean M. Twenge led an analysis of work preference surveys completed by high school seniors in 1976, 1991 and 2006, 17 percent of baby boomers strongly valued more than two weeks of vacation time, compared with 25 percent of Generation X and 31 percent of millennials.<br /><br />When we see our jobs primarily as a means to leisure, it’s easy to convince ourselves that efficiency should reign supreme at work so we have time for friendships outside work.<br /><br />BUT we may be underestimating the impact of workplace friendships on our happiness — and our effectiveness. Jobs are more satisfying when they provide opportunities to form friendships. Research shows that groups of friends outperform groups of acquaintances in both decision making and effort tasks.<br /><br />When friends work together, they’re more trusting and committed to one another’s success. That means they share more information and spend more time helping — and as long as they don’t hold back on constructive criticism out of politeness, they make better choices and get more done.<br /><br />What will make workplaces less transactional? Research suggests that social events aren’t always effective: People don’t mix much at mixers, and at company parties, they mostly bond with similar colleagues.<br /><br />Technology companies like Google and Facebook provide opportunities for shared games, sports, exercise and meals — and research suggests that playing together and eating together are good ways to foster cooperation. Meanwhile, LinkedIn has encouraged employees to take their personal lives to work by hosting Bring in Your Parents Day. And at organizations ranging from McKinsey to Chevron, an increasingly popular step is to build alumni networks, as universities do. As Reid Hoffman, Ben Casnocha and Chris Yeh observe in their book “The Alliance,” alumni networks can encourage employees to invest in relationships even when they won’t stay at jobs for decades.<br /><br />Whether we bond at work is a personal decision, but it may involve less effort and vulnerability than we realize. Jane E. Dutton, a professor at the University of Michigan, finds that a high-quality connection doesn’t require “a deep or intimate relationship.” A single interaction marked by respect, trust and mutual engagement is enough to generate energy for both parties. However small they appear, those moments of connection can transform a transaction into a relationship.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion:</span><br />Q1. Why having friends at work is so important?<br />Q2. How do you make friends at the office?<br />Q3. Would you exchange your line or FB with your colleagues?<br />Q4. Do you think it is hard to make friends at work? compare with friends from school?<br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:05pm discussion session (35 mins)<br />8:05 ~ 8:20pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:20 ~ 8:25pm Regrouping &amp; instruction giving<br />(Session II)<br />8:25 ~ 8:35pm Taking a 10 minutes break (Intermission)<br />8:35 ~ 9:10pm discussion session (35 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~ 9:30pm Concluding remarks</div>
