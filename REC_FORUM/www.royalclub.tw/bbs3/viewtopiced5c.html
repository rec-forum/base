Even as vaccination campaigns started in the United States and Europe, countries slammed shut their borders to visitors from the United Kingdom, because of a new strain of the coronavirus. And while the number of people flying in the United States is again on the rise — topping 1 million a day on the weekend before Christmas — a patchwork of quarantine and testing regulations remains in place in many parts of the country.<br /><br />Worldwide, Covid-19 has killed more than 1.5 million people, sickened millions more and short-circuited economies. Of all the industries reeling from its destructive impact, the travel industry was upended like no other.<br /><br />Travel has been changed by past calamities. Safety measures instituted after the 9/11 attacks are now just part of the travel experience. It’s unclear just which changes to the travel landscape will be in place a year from now — or 10 years on — but some answers are starting to come into focus.<br /><br />On the brink of the new year, we looked at nine of the most pressing queries facing the travel industry and individual travelers — here are the answers.<br /><br />Will I need to prove I’ve been vaccinated to travel?<br /><br />How long must I wait until travel picks up?<br /><br />When can I get back on a cruise ship?<br /><br />City or country? Where can I expect crowds?<br /><br />When will I be traveling for business again? And what about my frequent-flier miles?<br /><br />If I need to cancel, will flexible policies still be around?<br /><br />I’d like to travel with my family, what’s the outlook?<br /><br />What new travel trends can I expect to continue in 2021?<br /><br />Will I ever feel safe traveling?<br /><br />Questions:<br />Q1: From the 9 questions and answers, what are your concerns? Can you share your point of view?<br />Q2: If you can go travelling in 2021 or 2022, where will you visit and what will you prepare?<br />Q3: Even we can’t go travelling in 2020 or even 2021, but we can share the most unforgettable travel experience, can you share your story with us?<br /><br />(Welcome everyone can bring your souvenir or some interesting things to share with us) <br /><br /><br />Article 2: When you feel like quitting?<br />Speaker: Steve Harvey<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJqEvNkmIjw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJqEvNkmIjw</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Questions:<br />Q1: Do you even have the feeling like quitting? Can you share the situation or feeling?<br />Q2: How do you go through the difficulty/struggle?<br />Q3: Any advice to share with everyone?<br /><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00 ~ 7:30 pm greetings &amp; free talk<br />7:30 ~ 8:15 pm guests introduced &amp; first session discussion<br />8:15 ~ 8:45 pm presentation, sharing the article &amp; other experiences<br />8:45 ~ 9:30 pm second session discussion<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven,<br />板橋民生路二段237 號,<br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30,<br /><br />P.S.<br />1.因聚會地點是在咖啡店內，所以有低消80元喔！<br />2.參加三次後，只要繳交1000元 (學生:500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />3.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~</div>
