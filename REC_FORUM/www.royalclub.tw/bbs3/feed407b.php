Due to production disruptions in Brazil and forest fires in Canada, the global cost of short fiber pulp, which is used to produce toilet paper, has risen from US$650 per ton on average to US$800 as of February, according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA). One of the largest suppliers of toilet paper in Taiwan, YFY Inc., said that the rise in the price of pulp has caused costs to increase by more that 50 percent since mid-2017, and is continuing to climb, along with the cost of transportation and packaging, according to a CNA report.Toilet paper suppliers have informed Taiwan's retailers that prices of the product will go up by 10 to 30 percent, likely starting in mid-March. This means that consumers are likely to see the cost of a 12 pack of inter-fold toilet paper to rise from NT$200 (US$6.84) to NT$260 (US$8.89), reported CNA. After toilet paper brands announced the price hike on Friday (Feb. 23), word quickly spread to consumers and panic buying soon set in across Taiwan, with many shops reporting empty shelves by Sunday.<br /><br />The hysteria has spread to the web, with online retailer ETMall announcing that toilet paper products took up six out of the top 20 hottest selling items from Feb. 23 - Feb. 25, with sales of toilet tissues increasing by ten times over the weekend and many brands selling out completely, reported CNA.On Friday (Feb. 23), the Executive Yuan said the Cabinet's price stabilization task force has requested the Fair Trade Commission (FTC), the MOEA and the Consumer Protection Committee to investigate the announcement of the price hike by toilet paper brands. Wu Cheng-hsueh (吳政學), deputy director-general of Taiwan's Department of Consumer Protection, told the press on Sunday (Feb. 25) that the country's four major retailers promised that toilet paper prices will not rise until mid-March and urged the public not to engage in panic buying, reported UDN. Wu urged the public not to panic as he said retailers would not take advantage of the situation to hike prices, hoard toilet paper or empty the shelves. Wu said that department officials would conduct spot checks in stores and conduct regular monitoring to make sure the price hike of toilet paper does not lead to price rises in other products. In a phone interview with UDN, Wu said that Carrefour,  RT-Mart. A.mart, and PX Mart had all pledged to keep the price of toilet paper the same and not increase it at least until mid-March. Wu said that if retailers are found to be colluding together to raise prices, they could be fined up to NT$50 million. A male shopper surnamed Li (李) told Liberty Times that he was shocked to find the toilet paper shelves at the PX Mart in Taipei's Banqiao District completely bare yesterday (Feb. 25). Meanwhile, a female consumer surnamed Chen (陳) told the newspaper that all the stores she went to were out of toilet paper, and she said that it was not a fear of a price hike, but rather a fear of running out of the toilet tissues that stoked the panic buying. John Purkis, a British elementary school teacher living in Taipei, saw the mad rush for toilet paper first hand: &quot;I was at Carrefour in Taoyuan on Saturday night at 10 p.m. and every single person was checking out with their carts stacked 6 feet high with tissue paper.&quot;<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussions:</span><br />1.Did you buy toilet paper? Do you think we should stockpile some toilet paper because of the soaring price in the future?<br />2.From egg tart to a doll-catcher, the stores springs up like mushrooms at the corners at same time in Taiwan. What does it reflect for the phenomenon in Taiwan? <br />3.Will you follow up the people’s steps and do the same? Why or why not? <br />4.Do you have any methods to provide to our government to stop the panic buying?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #0000FF">Session II</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #0000FF">Mihir Garimella is making drones that go where humans cannot</span></span><br /><br /><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/02/08/tech/mihir-garimella-drones-tomorrows-hero/index.html" class="postlink">https://edition.cnn.com/2018/02/08/tech/mihir-garimella-drones-tomorrows-hero/index.html</a><br /><br />By Victoria Brown and Tom Page, CNN, February 8, 2018 <br /><br />Story highlights , 18-year-old creates fruit fly-inspired drone <br /><br />When Mihir Garimella was in fifth grade, his parents would chide him for leaving his bedroom light on. Rather than just remember to turn off the light, he rigged a motion sensor to automate the switch. A year later at his school orchestra, Garimella would get in trouble because he couldn't tune his violin. So he built a robot that listened to sound samples and tuned it for him. The 18-year-old from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is an ordinary teenager with an extraordinary eye for integrating tech solutions into everyday life. A Google Science Fair winner in 2014, a TEDx speaker in 2015, he'd designed a low-cost concussion detection kit, created a math app which recognizes and solves handwritten problems, and co-authored a paper on brain tumor diagnosis via image processing algorithms -- all before leaving high school.&quot; I've always loved just building things,&quot; he told CNN. It's perhaps an understatement.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><br />High-tech solutions from nature</span><br /><br />Garimella is best known for his work on drones, for which he won the Google prize. His research has taken him into the field of biomimicry -- designing robotics modeled on the natural world. In Garimella's case, he's focused on the humble fruit fly, an unlikely source of inspiration. &quot;Four years ago my family went to India on vacation,&quot; he recalls. &quot;When we got back we realized we'd left a bunch of bananas on the kitchen counter. By that point they were rotting, so our house was filled with fruit flies. &quot;Try as he might, they'd always evade the fly swat. &quot;I became curious about how these tiny organisms (with a) tiny brain, really bad eyesight, could possibly escape so effectively,&quot; he says. Garimella studied the insect, and sent emails to eminent biologists. To his surprise, professors at Caltech and Carnegie Mellon University replied. &quot;Fruit flies have the fastest visual system on the planet -- they can see 10 times faster than humans can,&quot; Garimella says. &quot;Their eyes are equivalent to a 25x25 pixel camera, so they basically can't see any detail at all. But as a result, they can process whatever information they do see very quickly. &quot;The teenager began wondering if this low-data approach could be applied to drones, traditionally difficult to maneuver in tight spaces and ill-adept in detecting and avoiding danger. His tiny FlyBot prototype fitted in the palm of a hand and acted like a fruit fly, outmaneuvering hazards using a single camera and Garimella's own algorithm to 3D-map its environment. The prizes flowed in, but for the student, there was more work to be done.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Going where humans dare not</span><br /><br />&quot;The next thing I looked at was carrying out missions in these spaces -- search and rescue, finding the source of a fire or chemical leak,&quot; he says. Finding positive uses for drones has been a hot topic in recent years, spurring on stories about medical drops in Rwanda and Amazon deliveries and competitions like Drones For Good in the UAE. Often these drones take different forms, varying in size. Garimella has been working to design a single drone that can perform multiple functions. &quot;The idea is that you take (my) drone, plug in different sensors based on whatever task you're trying to accomplish, and the drone would use those sensors to carry out a mission,&quot; he says. &quot;So in a search and rescue situation after an earthquake, you could plug in a thermal camera and the drone would use that to find people who are trapped.<br />&quot;If you're inspecting a nuclear power plant you could plug in radiation sensors and the drone could use that to pinpoint hot spots of radiation, find tanks that are going to leak. &quot;He lists many more potential uses, including industrial inspection. The idea is that with an adaptive, autonomous drone, these robots can spot potential dangers before they ever happen. &quot;I'm trying to keep these drones under the $1,000 price range,&quot; he adds, saying that after four years of work, he hopes to have a product on the market in the next &quot;one-to-two years.&quot; As a freshman studying computer science at Stanford University he's now balancing studies while launching his own company. &quot;My dream is to build something that can improve the lives of a billion people,&quot; he says.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussions:</span><br />1.Mihir Garimella got the inspiration from nature world and applied it on the drone. Newton found the gravity from the apples falling down from the trees. Do the stories enlighten you anything? <br />2.According to the article, the price of future drone designed for various multiple may keep the price under the US$1,000 - range so everybody can access it. Do you have any crazy ideas about the function of drones, such as to be a patrolman, help farmers spray insecticide or others?<br />3.With the new technology invention on the drone that provide us a lot of advantages, are there any disadvantages for us?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Agenda</span><br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />8:10 ~ 8:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:25 ~ 8:30pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:30 ~9:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~9:30pm Concluding remarks/feedback from newcomers<br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #FF0000">The meeting place of Thursday:<br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第一區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文<br /></span></span><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=827">Jason Tang</a> — Mon Mar 05, 2018 6:06 pm</p><hr />
