			<div class="content"><span style="color: #FF0000">Thursday gathering of Royal Club is relocated to Ikari 怡客咖啡, 台北市衡陽路116號</span><br /><br />Session I: Advantages and Disadvantages of Business Ownership<br /><br />Do you want to be a business owner someday? Before deciding, you might want to consider the following advantages and disadvantages .<br />Being a business owner can be extremely rewarding. Having the courage to take a risk and start a venture is part of the American dream. <br /><br />Success brings with it many advantages:<br />• Independence. As a business owner, you’re your own boss. You can’t get fired. More importantly, you have the freedom to make the decisions that are crucial to your own business success.<br />• Lifestyle. Owning a small business gives you certain lifestyle advantages. Because you’re in charge, you decide when and where you want to work. If you want to spend more time on nonwork activities or with your family, you don’t have to ask for the time off. If it’s important that you be with your family all day, you might decide to run your business from your home. Given today’s technology, it’s relatively easy to do. Moreover, it eliminates commuting time.<br />• Financial rewards. In spite of high financial risk, running your own business gives you a chance to make more money than if you were employed by someone else. You benefit from your own hard work.<br />• Learning opportunities. As a business owner, you’ll be involved in all aspects of your business. This situation creates numerous opportunities to gain a thorough understanding of the various business functions.<br />• Creative freedom and personal satisfaction. As a business owner, you’ll be able to work in a field that you really enjoy. You’ll be able to put your skills and knowledge to use, and you’ll gain personal satisfaction from implementing your ideas, working directly with customers, and watching your business succeed.<br /><br />Disadvantages of Small Business Ownership<br />As the little boy said when he got off his first roller-coaster ride, “I like the ups but not the downs!” Here are some of the risks you run if you want to start a small business:<br />• Financial risk. The financial resources needed to start and grow a business can be extensive. You may need to commit most of your savings or even go into debt to get started. If things don’t go well, you may face substantial financial loss. In addition, there’s no guaranteed income. There might be times, especially in the first few years, when the business isn’t generating enough cash for you to live on.<br />• Stress. As a business owner, you are the business. There’s a bewildering array of things to worry about—competition, employees, bills, equipment breakdowns, customer problems. As the owner, you’re also responsible for the well-being of your employees.<br />• Time commitment. People often start businesses so that they’ll have more time to spend with their families. Unfortunately, running a business is extremely time-consuming. In theory, you have the freedom to take time off, but in reality, you may not be able to get away. In fact, you’ll probably have less free time than you’d have working for someone else. For many entrepreneurs and small business owners, a forty-hour workweek is a myth; see Figure 5.6 &quot;The Entrepreneur’s Workweek&quot;. Vacations will be difficult to take and will often be interrupted. In recent years, the difficulty of getting away from the job has been compounded by cell phones, iPhones, Internet-connected laptops and iPads, and many small business owners have come to regret that they’re always reachable.<br />• Undesirable duties. When you start up, you’ll undoubtedly be responsible for either doing or overseeing just about everything that needs to be done. You can get bogged down in detail work that you don’t enjoy. As a business owner, you’ll probably have to perform some unpleasant tasks, like firing people.<br /><br />Questions:	<br />Q1. What do you think is necessary for starting a business? Will it succeed even if it has those requirements?<br />Q2. Do you think running a small business is simple and easy? Would you be willing to try if given the opportunity? What kind of business would you go in if you wanted?<br />Q3. Since those are many unfavorable factors in running a business, why are many people still willing to or even borrow money to engage in this high risk investment?<br />Q4. Are you satisfied with your current job? Why? if you can choose, which job you would like to select? Why? <br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Session II: It’s Time for Taiwan to Confront Its Own Ethnic Discrimination Issues<br /><br />The United States has been rocked by large street protests over the past months, sparked by the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died while being arrested by four police officers. These nationwide protests have brought the problems of societal racism and discriminatory policing toward the Black community in the U.S. to the forefront.<br />Taiwan, on the surface, might seem like a serene society that lacks much racial discrimination. Dig a little deeper, however, and the story is much different.<br /><br />The truth is that Taiwan’s tranquility masks serious exploitation of foreigners, especially from developing countries, as well as discrimination against foreigners. The poor treatment of foreign Southeast Asian workers, who number in the hundreds of thousands, is widespread, while there are discriminatory policies and behavior towards non-Taiwanese residents.<br />Most Taiwanese may not be outwardly racist, but there is still an ethnocentric way of thinking that facilitates discriminatory attitudes and a tendency to regard some non-locals, especially from Southeast Asia, as lesser beings. Ethnic homogeneity and an unfamiliarity with foreigners among some citizens might play big factors, but in an age of technology and globalization, these need to be overcome.<br />Another group in Taiwan that is not fully accepted are the hundreds of thousands of workers from Southeast Asia. Hailing mainly from Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines, they contribute substantially to Taiwan’s economy by working in factories, fishing boats, senior homes, and households. And yet many of these factory workers, fishermen and domestic helpers are being exploited, harassed or having their pay withheld.<br /><br />The latest example of labor discontent was on June 2 when over 800 Vietnamese workers at a Compal factory went on strike over a high wage deduction for boarding and poor dormitory living conditions. The labor authorities had to step in to negotiate and eventually the two sides reached an understanding.<br />Employing tens of thousands of foreign crew members, Taiwan’s massive fishing industry is rife with physical abuse, shoddy conditions, and contract violations of primarily Southeast Asian fishermen at sea. Beatings are not uncommon, nor are wage deductions and coercion of workers to remain on board their ships.<br /><br />In addition to poor working conditions, foreign crew members are also sometimes victims of human trafficking. Ship owners often fail to legally register workers, leaving them with no legal protection and entirely at the mercy of Taiwanese boat owners and labor brokers. This has been an issue for years and international media and NGOs, along with U.S. government reports, have condemned this exploitation.<br />Meanwhile, even international students at Taiwanese universities have been exploited by being tricked into unpaid labor at factories. In recent years, hundreds of students from the Philippines, Indonesia and Sri Lanka have allegedly been forced to do manual labor at factories and even a slaughterhouse. In January 2019, Indonesia even suspended allowing its students to enter work-study programs in Taiwan due to reports of Indonesian students being used as cheap labor.<br />The most recently revealed case involved dozens of students from Eswatini, Taiwan’s only African diplomatic ally, who were allegedly made to work in a chicken factory illegally in 2018 as part of a work-study program. The Ministry of Education is investigating this case, while the students’ university has claimed it had done nothing wrong.<br /><br />The use of public space by domestic helpers on their weekly day off has been contested, after the Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) said last month it would ban people from sitting in the main hall of Taipei Main Station after the lifting of social distancing measures implemented due to the coronavirus. Given that domestic helpers often use this area to relax in during their days off, the ban would affect them.<br />As for foreigners in Taiwan with residency status, especially those from the West and white, they usually don’t experience too many problems. If anything, Western residents are treated much better by Taiwanese than non-Western and non-white residents.<br />However, discrimination still pops up in daily life and policies.<br /><br />It is also well-known that some Taiwanese bushiban English tutoring centers and kindergartens prefer to hire white, Western tutors to teach their kids. This preference for white candidates means that African-American and even Asian-Americans have been discriminated against, demonstrating a clear and disturbing racial bias that ignores actual language and teaching abilities.<br />For foreign residents who formally want to become Taiwanese, citizenship is extremely difficult to apply for and attain, especially as it does not allow dual citizenship and hence requires renouncing one’s existing citizenship. While the law was changed in 2017 to allow for exceptions, this is also very onerous—one must be a “high-level professional” or have made special contributions to Taiwan—and few people actually do so.<br />Taiwan society will need to change its mindset and be more open to foreigners, due to a need to attract talent and immigrants, increase its low and declining birthrate, and to fit into a globalized world.<br /><br />It will especially need to learn to accept Southeast Asians as residents and not merely as laborers. Already, Southeast Asian spouses are growing in number, with 390,000 married to Taiwanese as of 2020. In 2019, Southeast Asian spouses made up over 40% of transnational marriages involving Taiwanese. However, it can be difficult for these spouses to obtain permanent residency in Taiwan since marriages between Taiwanese and Southeast Asian nationals are subject to additional background checks by immigration officials.<br />Whether it be ending systematic exploitation of workers and students from developing countries, or reforming government policies that discriminate against foreigners or handling casual discrimination in normal life, Taiwan has many issues it needs to work on.<br /><br />Questions:<br />Q1. At present, foreign workers in Taiwan can be seen everywhere. Do you have a different mentality between whose foreign workers from Southeast Asia and whose from other regions in European or American? If so,Why? <br />Q2. Do your family , relatives and friends have hired foreign workers? Are they treated well? If you need to hire one , how would you treat her?<br />Q3. If Taiwan does not have these foreign workers, many families and industries may will suffering severely affected. Do you think foreign workers will snatch Taiwanese job opportunities? Are Taiwanese will to do those heavy, hard and dangerous job? Why?<br />Q4. In recent years, many Taiwanese have married with foreign brides. If you have the opportunity, would you consider marry with foreigners? Why?</div>
