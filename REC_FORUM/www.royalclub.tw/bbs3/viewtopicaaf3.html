I still find that hard to believe. I mean, it was crazy but that's what happened. I was 26 years old, and Bob Gilga, the head of photography at the geographic called me back to their headquarters in Washington DC to give me my marching orders and I remember. I remember standing in the lobby of what they call<br />“Explorers Hall “ and I was looking at a giant globe and dog sleds and submersibles and flags planted on Everest, and surrounded by the most beautiful photographs I've ever seen in my life. How was I gonna prove that I was worthy of working here, and then I was taken upstairs and into Bob's office. Bob was a blunt man, just straight and to the point and honestly a little scary; well that morning I was completely unprepared for what he said to me. He stopped me cold; he changed the way I did everything from that day forward. He looked at me from over his desk and he said, “You know to it, the people who photograph for this magazine are the best in the world. You don't have to prove yourself”. I don't have to prove myself; I mean honestly that's all I've been thinking about since I got the assignment. “You don't have to prove yourself”, he continued, “but by God every day you had better improve yourself”. The words went in; “don't prove yourself improve yourself”. Bob was still talking; he said,” You know, I want you to spend your time every day trying to be better than you were yesterday. If you learn something that'll help the others, will then share it; that way we'll all get better faster. Don't prove yourself, improve yourself; otherwise you've fired.” big first lesson. Right how did the blocks? I don't know how many times I've thought about it, how many times I've acted on it since that day in Bob's office. “Don't prove yourself; improve yourself”, and you know living that lesson I've come to see that life really is a lot more about cooperation than it is about competition. It wasn't proving myself or taken others down that allowed me to succeed; it was simply, consciously, continuously improving myself; refining my skills, honing my wisdom, focusing my vision. Ultimately, the only person I was trying to surpass was me. Don't prove, improve.<br /><br />Q1. Why do we always want to prove ourselves?<br />Q2. Why should we try to surpass ourselves?<br />Q3. How are we consciously continuously improving ourselves? Are there any examples in your life of continuous improvement?<br />Q4. Prove yourself is a &quot;static&quot; view of life. Improve yourself is a dynamic view of life.<br />Are you working to prove yourself or improve yourself?<br /><br />Session II:<br />Amazon to (finally) open checkout-free store in Seattle<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/21/technology/business/amazon-go-seattle-store/index.html">http://money.cnn.com/2018/01/21/technol ... index.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Attention Seattle shoppers: Amazon is about to open its long-promised convenience store with zero checkout lines.<br />Customers must scan theAmazon Go app upon entering the store. Sensors will then track their movements and charge shoppers' Amazon (AMZN) accounts for the items they grab. Customers just walk out of the store. No cashiers needed. <br />The Wall Street Journal reported last March that the tech that powers theshop was a bit more difficult to develop than initially thought. <br />Amazon on Sunday disputed that, telling CNNMoney that &quot;there were no technology problems.&quot; <br />The company said it's workers have been allowed toshop at the store during its testing phase. According to the spokesperson, the &quot;volume of business from justAmazon employees turned out to be significantly higher than expected.&quot;<br />Amazon Go's offerings include groceries, ready-to-eat meals, cold drinks and meal prep kits. <br />The tech giant first introduced the Amazon Go store concept in 2016, and it was set to open to the public in early 2017.<br />&quot;We were able to learn everything we needed from just that subset of customers,&quot; the person added. <br />Monday will mark the first time the general public will be able to test it out. <br />Related: Why you want Amazon to be your new neighbor<br />The first store is located in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered. <br />Amazon said Sunday that more may open in the future, but that &quot;for now we're laser focused on this store.&quot; <br />E-Commerce Guide by CNN Underscored: Eight unknown perks of having an Amazon prime account<br />Amazon Go marks the latest addition to Amazon's brick-and-mortar ventures. <br />The company now operates 13 bookstores across the U.S., and three more locations are on the way, according to Amazon's website. The company also purchased the Whole Foods grocery chain in June for $13.7 billion. <br />It's not just Amazon: Chinese tech giants are selling groceries too<br />Amazon's foray into operating physicalshops is laced with irony, considering Amazon is widely blamed for driving some traditional retailers out of business with its quick-shipping e-commerce site. <br />But the company has made it clear it's not building your grandparents' shopping destinations. <br />Just likeAmazon Go, Amazon bookstores are geared for the digitally savvy. <br />Inside those shops, digital displays under each book show the number of stars it's received on Amazon.com. At checkout, there's no cash. Customers must pay with a card or through the Amazon app on their phones. <br />--CNN Tech's Seth Fiegerman contributed to this report.<br /><br />Q1. Have you ever bought anything from Amazon? What is your experience?<br />Q2. For an e-commerce company like Amazon, why do they need to open brick-and-mortars?<br />Q3. Would you be willing to buy something from Amazon go? Why or why not?<br />Q4. What is the impact of check-out free stores? Who will benefit from that?<br />Agenda<br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:05pm discussion session (35 mins)<br />8:05 ~ 8:20pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:20 ~ 8:25pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:25 ~ 8:35pm Taking a 10 minutes break (Intermission)<br />8:35 ~ 9:10pm discussion session (35 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~ 9:30pm Concluding remarks/feedback from newcomers<br />The meeting place of Thursday:<br />摩斯漢堡明曜店 (明曜百貨後面第二條巷子地下室)<br />台北市大安區仁愛路四段151巷37號B1樓<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運 - 板南線 - 忠孝敦化站 (步行約5分鐘)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
