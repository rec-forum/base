5/14(Sun.) Japanese Trends: Why Are People Eating Less Rice?/ £1.3 million lottery winner went back to work at McDonald's after winning life changing money<br /><br />Agenda:<br />7:00-7:05 pm Opening Remarks<br />Session 1:<br />7:05-7:40 pm<br />Individual Presentation<br />7:40-8:00<br />Group discussion.<br />Session 2.<br />8:00-8:40 pm<br />Individual<br />8：40-9:00 pm<br />Group discussion.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://zoomtw.zoom.us/j/92987266213?pw">https://zoomtw.zoom.us/j/92987266213?pw</a><!-- m --> ...<br />Meeting ID:929 8726 6213<br />Password:112233<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Japanese Trends: Why Are People Eating Less Rice?</span><br /><br />A recent survey of 1,000 people by Makino, a rice retail company in Chiba prefecture, found that although 85% of Japanese people eat rice every day, 68% eat it only once a day. And only 17% eat rice for all three meals. Rice consumption in Japan has been falling since the 1960s. According to Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries — or MAFF — Japanese rice consumption peaked in 1962 at around 118 kilograms per person, and has been falling ever since. By 2020, rice consumption was just over 50 kilograms per person — under half the 1962 figure. This trend away from rice seems to have developed from efforts to improve people's diets after World War II. After the war there wasn't enough food in Japan, so the US provided wheat flour that was used to make bread for school lunches. During the 1950s and 1960s, the Japanese government also encouraged people to eat more Western foods such as bread, meat and dairy products, which were seen as more healthy.<br />More recently, an increase in people living alone and in families where both parents are working has led to a change in eating habits. Traditional Japanese family meals with rice take time to prepare, but simple meals with bread or noodles can be prepared very quickly. Now MAFF is trying to reverse this trend by promoting the use of rice in school lunches and providing information on the health benefits of rice. In recent years, the Japanese government has also been promoting rice flour as a healthy, gluten-free alternative to wheat flour, and has been trying to increase rice flour exports abroad. As wheat prices rise because of the weak yen and the war in Ukraine, rice flour could also become more popular in Japan.<br />Discussions:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />1.Are you surprised that only 17% eat rice for three meals in Japan? How often do you eat rice?<br />2.Have you changed your eating habit from rice to Western food? <br /> Do you consider Western food to be healthy?<br />3. How often do you cook at home? Do you think eating at home is healthier and save money?  <br />4.What is your staple foods – rice, noodles, steamed bun or others ? <br />5.What kind of Taiwan traditional foods would you like to recommend ?<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">£1.3 million lottery winner went back to work at McDonald's after winning life changing money, 01 April 2023, Ali Condon</span><br />When a lucky punter bagged a whopping £1.3 million in the National Lottery, he had the opportunity to change his life forever. But, it turned out that 25-year-old Luke Pittard actually quite liked his life the way it was. So, not long after winning the fortune, he decided to turn in his luxury life and head back to work at McDonald's. Luke was working as a staff trainer at McDonald's in Pontprennau, Cardiff when he won the colossal stack of cash back in 2006.Not only did he have great mates at the fast food joint, but it's where he met his future wife, Emma Cox. When you win a million pound jackpot, it seems only right to hand in your notice and kick your feet up, so that's what Luke did. During his time away he went in on his new millionaire lifestyle, splashing out on a trip to the Canary Islands, a dream wedding for him and Emma, and a property worth over £200k.But eventually, Luke realised that there was 'more to life than money', and started to miss his pals at McDonald's. So, a year and a half after his big win, Luke decided to return to work.<br />&quot;I loved working at McDonald's before I became a millionaire and I'm really enjoying being back there again,&quot; he told The Sun at the time. &quot;Lots of my old McDonald's workmates came to our wedding and I had kept in touch with them all the time, so I just thought: 'Why not go back?' &quot;He added: &quot;You can only go shopping a certain number of times before you start seeing the same things. It was getting boring and repetitive and I put on a stone in weight. I was eating constantly. &quot;I enjoy going to work. It’s better than staying at home all day. &quot;And Luke has been able to use his winnings to make the working day a little bit easier.&quot;I used to walk to work all the time but now I get a taxi there and back. &quot;If that isn't the high life, I don't know what is. Even though he made more money per week on interest on his lottery winnings than he did in McDonald's, Luke's wife Emma fully supported his decision. &quot;I can totally understand it. We both really enjoyed working at McDonald's and still have good friends there. &quot;So it was really familiar for him and something for him to look forward to.&quot;<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />Discussions:<br />1.If you are the jackpot winner, will you quit your job immediately? Why ?<br />2.How will you distribute your money and what will you do to spend your money?<br />3.According to the statistic in America, the people who win the big jackpot will go bankruptcy with 3-5 years. What do you think the reasons?<br />4.Have you even bought any lottery and what’s your expectation? To try your luckiness or win money to become a millionaire?<br />5.Have your friends or relatives had experienced to win lottery? Share us.<br /></div></blockquote><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12531">Danny Lin</a> — Wed May 10, 2023 9:29 am</p><hr />

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Sam.<br />Neil<br />And I’m Neil.<br />Sam<br />Your friend, Alicia, phoned and left you a message for you, Neil. She’s sorry but she has to cancel lunch today. I think she’s going with Jenny, instead.<br />Neil<br />That’s the third time this week they’ve had lunch together! Are they best friends now?<br />Sam<br />It sounds like Neil has a case of the green-eyed monster, in other words, jealousy – the fear that someone else may take something you think is yours.  Humans have struggled with jealousy for thousands of years. Jealousy damages friendships, destroys relationships, and can even become a motive for murder.<br />Neil<br />In this programme, we’ll discuss jealousy to find out happens when the green-eyed monster raises its ugly head. And, as usual, we’ll be learning some useful new vocabulary. Meanwhile, my friend Alicia will be having lunch with Jenny instead of me…<br />Sam<br />Feeling jealous is no fun. Maybe this question will take your mind off it. The expression ‘the green-eyed monster’ comes from a speech in one of William Shakespeare’s most famous plays, but which one? Is it:<br />a)    Romeo and Juliet?<br />b)    Hamlet? or,<br />c)    Othello?<br />Neil<br />I think the answer is Othello.<br />Sam<br />OK, Neil. I’ll reveal the answer later in the programme. For many people, feelings of jealousy occur in romantic relationships. Here psychologist, Dr Alex Mielke,explains whyto BBC World Service programme, CrowdScience.<br />Dr Alex Mielke<br />So you have a friend, a significant other, your parents… and you have the feeling that this relationship is threatened by someone else starting some form of relationship with them, starting a new friendship, you know, flirting with them and so on, which is different from envy, for example, which is probably the emotion that gets you to act when someone has something you want and you have to somehow get that from them – that’s when you feel envious.<br />Neil<br />Jealousy can be a problem for husbands and wives, boyfriends and girlfriends, or anyone involved in a romantic relationship. Dr Mielke uses the term, significant other, to describe any kind of romantic partner who you have a long-term relationship with.<br />Sam<br />You might feel jealous if someone flirts with your partner. Flirting is when you behave as if you are sexually attracted to someone but in a playful way rather than with serious intentions.<br />Neil<br />Dr Mielke also notes the difference between two words people often confuse: jealousy, and a similar term, envy - wanting what someone else has. You could be envious of someone’s possessions like a new car, their achievements like promotion at work, or a personal quality like being funny or good-looking.<br />Sam<br />So, jealousy involves three people – you, your loved one, and someone else - whereas envy involves just two - you and the person who has something you want. But while these emotions are easy to define, they can be very difficult to manage.<br />Neil<br />Jealousy can lead to controlling behaviour, like checking your partner’s text messages or monitoring who they see, behaviour which damages relationships. But unlike other psychological problems such as anxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorder, many do not feel brave enough to ask for help with their jealousy.<br />Sam<br />So, what can people who struggle with jealousy do? That’s the question Caroline Steel, presenter of BBC World Service programme, CrowdScience, asked clinical psychologist, Dr Johan Ahlen.<br />Caroline Steel<br />If there was sort of an ideal future for people looking for help with their jealousy, what would it be like? Could there be a pill? Or would it be a specific therapy? Or what’s kind of a realistic ideal future?<br />Dr Johan Ahlen<br />I believe that some kind of cognitive behavioural therapy where you work with decreasing this monitoring and checking behaviours like having a plan for how to do that because that's not easy. And also, at the same time increasing activities or behaviours that harmonise with how you want to become. <br />Neil<br />Unfortunately, Dr Ahlen says jealousy cannot be cured by taking a pill – medicine in the form of a small tablet that you swallow.<br />Sam<br />Instead, he recommends cognitive behavioural therapy, or CBT for short, a therapy which helps people deal with their emotions by changing how they think about things. Instead of feeling jealous that your best friend is spending time with someone else, try feeling happy that she’s made a new friend.<br />Neil<br />Good idea - plus I won’t have that horrid feeling of the green-eyed monster inside! Speaking of which, it’s time to reveal the answer to your question, Sam. <br />Sam<br />I asked which famous Shakespearian play first described jealousy as ‘the green-eyed monster’.<br />Neil<br />I said it was Othello. So, was I right?<br />Sam<br />Othello was the correct answer! Othello becomes so jealous that he murders his wife, Desdemona, before killing himself. If only he’d had some therapy! Right, let’s recap the vocabulary from this programme on the green-eyed monster, another name for jealousy.<br />Neil<br />A significant other is a wife, husband or other romantic partner who you are in a long-term relationship with.<br />Sam<br />Flirting means playfully pretending you are sexually attracted to someone.<br />Neil<br />The emotion envy means wanting what someone else has. <br />Sam<br />A pill is medicine in the form of a small tablet which you swallow.<br />Neil<br />And finally, cognitive behavioural therapy or CBT is a type of therapy where people are encouraged to change the way they think about their emotional and behavioural problems. Once again, our six minutes are up. Join us again soon for more emotional support as well as new and useful vocabulary here at 6 Minute English. Bye for now!<br />Sam<br />Bye bye!<br /><br />Q1.
