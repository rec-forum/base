Love food, Hate waste <br /><br />Sometimes we waste food intentionally because we bought too much and the food becomes rotten, or because we don’t like the taste of the food. When we waste food, do you know the consequences? On this website <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.lovefoodhatewaste.com/">https://www.lovefoodhatewaste.com/</a><!-- m -->, there are some valuable information on what happens when we waste too much food. Feel free to skim the topics on the website above and choose an article you like before answering the following questions. <br /><br />Questions:<br />1. If you have leftover at home or restaurant, how do you deal with them usually? Are you aware of throwing food on a day to day basis? <br />2. What do you think if we too waste the food? Please try to talk about the pros and cons. Or in contrast, if we save food, how about its pros and cons. <br />3. Did you find any information on the website you haven’t thought about before? Which topic on the website you like the most? And why?<br />4. Do you think the website is helpful and can make a difference to our planet? And why?<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Session 2. Northern lights (aurora borealis): What they are &amp; how to see them<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRmm5jw5lX4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRmm5jw5lX4</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The northern lights are an atmospheric phenomenon that's regarded as the Holy Grail of skywatching.<br /><br />The northern lights, or the aurora borealis, are beautiful dancing waves of light that have captivated people for millennia. But for all its beauty, this spectacular light show is a rather violent event. <br /><br />Energized particles from the sun slam into Earth's upper atmosphere at speeds of up to 45 million mph (72 million kph), but our planet's magnetic field protects us from the onslaught. <br /><br />As Earth's magnetic field redirects the particles toward the poles — there are southern lights, too, which you can read about below — the dramatic process transforms into a cinematic atmospheric phenomenon that dazzles and fascinates scientists and skywatchers alike.<br /><br />Seeing the northern lights with your own eyes is a bucket-list item for astronomy lovers and travelers alike. Fortunately, they occur frequently. <br />&quot;The northern lights are happening 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year,&quot; said photographer Chad Blakely, owner of the northern lights tour company Lights Over Lapland(opens in new tab). But that doesn't mean they're easy to spot; you need to be at the right place at the right time.<br /><br />The best place to see the northern lights is any destination in the &quot;auroral zone,&quot; the area within an approximately 1,550-mile (2,500 kilometers) radius of the North Pole, according to the Tromsø Geophysical Observatory(opens in new tab) in Norway. That's where the aurora most frequently occurs, though the phenomenon can creep farther south during particularly strong solar storms. <br /><br />Related: Where to see the northern lights: 2022 aurora borealis guide<br />In March 1989, for example, a powerful solar eruption made the northern lights visible, albeit briefly, to people as far south as Honduras. (There were some negative consequences as well, however: The geomagnetic storm that supercharged the aurora also temporarily knocked out electricity across the entire Canadian province of Quebec.)  <br /><br />Within the auroral zone, it's best to be as far away from city lights as possible to maximize visibility. But it's pretty tricky to get into the middle of the Arctic wilderness, even with a guide, so it's best to base yourself in a destination with solid infrastructure, like Fairbanks, Alaska; Yellowknife, Canada; Svalbard, Norway; Abisko National Park, in Sweden; Rovaniemi, Finland; and pretty much anywhere in Iceland.<br /><br />The best time of year to see the northern lights is between September and April, when the sky gets dark enough to see the aurora. (Far northern locales experience the midnight sun, or 24 hours of daylight in the summer.) The most action usually happens between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m., according to the Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska Fairbanks(opens in new tab). Keep the moon phases in mind, as a bright full moon might fill the night sky with light. Check local weather forecasts as well, because you won't be able to spot the aurora through the clouds.<br /><br />You can also monitor aurora forecasts from the University of Alaska Fairbanks' Geophysical Institute(opens in new tab) and NOAA, which offers both three-day(opens in new tab) and 30-minute forecasts(opens in new tab).<br /><br />Reference: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.space.com/15139-northern-lights-auroras-earth-facts-sdcmp.html">https://www.space.com/15139-northern-li ... sdcmp.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Questions:<br />1. After reading this article, are you interested in seeing northern lights? <br />2. Please share other natural phenomenons in the sky which you have seen, like northern lights, shooting stars, a sea of clouds and etc. Where have you seen them and what you felt when you saw them?<br />3. Do you have any plan or special dream which you want to travel or explore it in your life? Please share it to our fellows.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=46353">Ellen Lu</a> — Tue Sep 13, 2022 5:36 pm</p><hr />
