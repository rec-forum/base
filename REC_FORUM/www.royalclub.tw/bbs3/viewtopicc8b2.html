As the saying goes, &quot;You're as young as you feel!&quot; Dating as a senior is a wonderful and fulfilling experience. This is your guide to making the most of your dating experience as a senior. <br /><br />Best Ways to Meet Single Seniors<br />Many single seniors are anxious to get back into the dating scene. The biggest question is where to begin? Thanks to technological advances, the dating world has changed drastically We now live in a world where the sky is the limit on how you are able to meet someone. It used to be the only way to meet someone was at work, set-up by a mutual friend, or a chance meeting around town. This makes for an extremely small dating pool and leaves the likelihood of meeting someone to chance. <br /><br />Welcome to the world of online dating! Online dating has revolutionizedthe dating scene. In fact, singles of all ages have turned to online dating to meet their match, with many doing so very successfully. Zoosk, OurTime, and Elite Singles are among the top-rated online dating websites for seniors. <br /><br />If online dating is not your thing, that's okay! Look for activities in your community to become involved with that are geared towards seniors. For instance, most cities offer senior centers. Senior centers are designed as a way for seniors in the community to come together and engage in different activities. The specific activities will vary among different centers but most offer educational programs, fitness and wellness classes, art programs, and various social events throughout the year. This is a great way to meet singles who live nearby, find someone you have a connection who shares similar interests. After all, even though opposites attract, 2 people must have some common interests. <br /><br />Navigating the First Date<br />First dates can be intimidating no matter your age. For seniors, this can be particularly true. How should seniors approach their first date? First and foremost, if you've never met or barely know your date, choose a public place for your first date. You can't be too careful when it comes to scams and traps. The more comfortable you are, the more you will enjoy yourself. Make sure you wear clothes that are both comfortable and appropriate for your much-anticipated date. <br /><br />One of the big differences in dating as a senior and dating in your 20s is you have more of a past. This is not a bad thing. It means you have life experience and know what you are looking for in a relationship. This also means you have a greater opportunity to share information which you should probably keep to yourself. For instance, do not overly share on medical issues you may be having. It's okay to mention them, but do not go into any gory details on the first date. <br /><br />There is an excellent chance that you have previous relationships that have either ended in divorce or the unfortunate death of your spouse. The first date is not the time or place to go into great lengthy detail of these past relationships. Save this information for a time when the 2 of you know each other better and are connecting on a deeper level. Whatever you do, never compare your date to one of your exes. Even if it's a good comparison, it is an instant turn off. <br /><br />You should always focus on having fun on your date. First dates come with the flutter of butterflies in your stomach and the anticipation of what might be. This is your chance to get to know someone and take a new adventure! <br /><br />Matters of Intimacy<br />Intimacy knows no age limit and is an important part of a healthy relationship. Many seniors believe that because either they or their partner no longer have the ability to bear children, that there isn't a need to use protection. This could not be further from the truth! Yes, it is true that becoming pregnant or fathering a child may no longer be a concern, but it does not mean you are safe from STDs. <br /><br />When entering a new relationship, seniors should still be mindful of protecting themselves against unwanted diseases. Although you think it may be obvious whether or not your partner has an STD, there are many diseases which do not show any symptoms at all. It is better to be safe than sorry. If you have sex with multiple partners or aren't sure of your partner's sexual history, it is important to get tested once a year for both you and your partner's safety. <br /><br />There's No Rush<br />One of the best things about dating as a senior is the lack of pressure. You aren't racing the clock to start a family, buy a house, and climb the corporate ladder. Take your time getting to know someone you are interested in. In fact, there isn't even a rush to become exclusive unless both of you feel strongly about it. <br /><br />Another great aspect of dating as a senior is the tendency to get to the truth quicker. Seniors understand what they are looking for out of life and out of a partner. There is nothing wrong with getting straight down to business on whether or not you see eye to eye.<br /><br />Do not ignore substantial differences such as relationship goals. Decide what is acceptable to you as far as the financial standing of a partner. Everyone is different. There isn't a right or wrong answer when it comes to the perfect partner. <br /><br />Without Limitations<br />For many seniors, transportation presents an issue when it comes to engaging in dating and other activities. No need to fear, enjoy life without limitations! Caring Senior Service offers transportation to seniors so they do not miss out on a thing! Whether your senior needs to run errands, make it to an appointment, or wants to attend a social event, transportation can be arranged. Contact us today and learn how you or your loved one can keep their freedom!<br />We hope that this guide gives you the confidence to ask out someone new or further pursue a relationship that you've been enjoying.<br /><br />Discussion:<br />1.

It is summer time. Do you turn your air-conditioner on all day long? <br />Why / why not?<br />2. It’s getting hotter and hotter this summer. What will you do to prevent heat attack when having outdoor activities?<br />3. What would you do if you encountered a stranger who faints or loses consciousness suddenly?<br />4. Chinese medicine practitioners recommend taking ice or icy cool food as less as possible. What is your comment?</div>
