Korean Wave (Hallyu) – The Rise of Korea’s Cultural Economy &amp; Pop Culture</span>   Excerpted from <a href="https://martinroll.com/resources/articles/asia/korean-wave-hallyu-the-rise-of-koreas-cultural-economy-pop-culture/" class="postlink">https://martinroll.com/resources/articles/asia/korean-wave-hallyu-the-rise-of-koreas-cultural-economy-pop-culture/</a><br /><br />The Korean Wave (Hallyu) refers to the global popularity of South Korea’s cultural economy exporting pop culture, entertainment, music, TV dramas and movies.<br /><br />Hallyu is a Chinese term which, when translated, literally means “Korean Wave”. It is a collective term used to refer to the phenomenal growth of Korean culture and popular culture encompassing everything from music, movies, drama to online games and Korean cuisine just to name a few. During former president Barack Obama’s state visit to Korea in March 2012, he made reference to the Korean Wave, which was made the country’s top priority by the government.<br /><br />South Korea is one of the only countries in the world, if not the only one, that has a dedicated goal to become the world’s leading exporter of popular culture. It is a way for Korea to develop its “soft power”. Soft power is a popular term coined in 1990 by Harvard political scientist Joseph Nye. It refers to the intangible power a country wields through its image, rather than through hard force. Hard force refers to military power or economic power. An example of soft power in play is how the US enticed the world to buy its Levi’s jeans, Apple iPhones, Marlboro cigarettes, Coca-Cola soft drinks and Hollywood movies, by leveraging on a desirable image. A unique image of cool.<br /><br />Hallyu first spread to China and Japan, later to Southeast Asia and several countries worldwide where it continues to have a strong impact. In 2000, a 50-year ban on the exchange of popular culture between Korea and Japan was partly lifted, which improved the surge of Korean popular culture among the Japanese.  South Korea’s broadcast authorities have been sending delegates to promote their TV programs and cultural content in several countries.<br /><br />Hallyu has been a blessing for Korea, its businesses, culture and country image. Since early 1999, Hallyu has become one of the biggest cultural phenomena across Asia. The Hallyu effect has been tremendous, contributing to 0.2% of Korea’s GDP in 2004, amounting to approximately USD 1.87 billion. More recently in 2019, Hallyu had an estimated USD 12.3 billion boost on the Korean economy.<br /><br />Over the last two decades, South Korea has become very rich and very futuristic. In 1965, Korea’s GDP per capita was less than that of Ghana. Today, South Korea is the world’s 12th largest economy. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The spillover effects of Hallyu</span><br /><br />The cumulative effect of movies, music, dramas and games has been tremendously positive to the Korean economy and the Korean country image in the region. According to the Korea Foundation for International Cultural Exchange, Hallyu contributed USD 9.5 billion to the Korean economy in 2018. Hallyu has contributed immensely to Korean tourism as well. An opinion survey conducted by the KTO in 2019 found that the total Hallyu-related tourist spend is USD 1.1 billion and that Hallyu-related tourism made up 55.3% of all inbound tourism. With the K-Culture Valley or “Hallyu-wood” theme park already built and with further upcoming developments, this traffic is expected to increase, which will in turn fuel the growth of the Korean wave.<br /><br />Some of the spillover effects of Hallyu on tourism in Korea include:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Rise of the Korean superstars:</span> The main components of the Korean Wave – movies, music and the dramas – has given birth to a new generation of Korean celebrities who have attained superstar status in the entire South East Asian countries including Japan, China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Bae Yong-joon (Yonsama), BoA, and others have been drawing huge crowds where they go. A case in point is when the Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi mentioned in a press conference that he wished that he were as popular as Yonsama. This has given Koreans a great boost in their confidence as their stars are being looked up to by millions of people in the region. On a lighter note, this has also helped soften the tension during international discussion between politicians as many politicians who visit South Korea have been insisting on meeting these celebrities on a personal front.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Increased interest in Korean tourism:</span> Hallyu has given Korean tourism a shot in the arm and helped tremendously in repositioning the Korean country image globally. As the movies, music bands and the dramas gained popularity, people from many countries have been flocking into Korea to experience the Korean culture first hand. KTO has been very active in offering package tours which includes a visit to the shooting locations, the various towns and resorts made famous in the movies and dramas and so on.<br /><br />In 2019, Korea earned USD 21.5 billion from tourism, attracting a total of 17.5 million tourists. With South Korea’s international tourist growth forecasted at an annualized rate of 3.3% to hit around 1.8 billion by 2030, the Korean government is planning to increase its tourism revenues to USD 35 billion a year by then. The side effect of this tourist boom has been an increased popularity of Korean cuisine.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Improved Korean country image: </span>Korean popular culture has had a significant impact on the global fashion industry as an increasing number of Korean celebrities are included in the social fiber of fashion.  New York has had its appearances of K-Pop girl groups like Girls’ Generation, Hyuna from 4Minute and CL from 2NE1. The singer G-Dragon dresses in an influential way that gets international notice as Korean celebrities are known for mixing styles and genres in clothing. Korean popular culture products including TV series such as My Love From The Star, music from PSY, boy bands like EXO and girl bands like Girl’s Day, are putting Korea on the global scene.<br /><br />Till very recently, South Korea evoked the images of the Korean War, the North-South Korean conflict, the burgeoning chaebols, many of which suffered hugely during the Asian financial crisis and the Seoul Olympics. All in all, nothing very positive and glamorous. Brand Korea was pretty elusive to everyone outside of Korea.<br /><br />All of that has started to change with the explosion of Hallyu. Hallyu has provided Korea with an excellent opportunity to showcase its diverse culture, people, its unique entertainment products, exotic locales and its own pan-Asian superstars to the rest of the world and thereby create a very strong brand Korea. With the maddening popularity of Korean movies and dramas, the focus seems to have shifted towards Korean values, society, emotions and the beautiful locations projected in these movies. This in turn has given Korea a good chance to create new perceptions and images of itself across the world.<br /><br />All these factors have had the unstinting support from the Korean government, all the artists, businessmen as well as the Korean population. This collaborative effort has propelled Hallyu into a sustained cultural phenomenon rather than just a mere fad.<br /><br /><br />Questions:<br /><br />1. Do you know how popular Korean culture is around the world? And why is it able to gain so much global spotlight?<br /><br />2. Do you watch any kind of drama or movie made by South Korea? What was it you have watched most recently? Do you like it and why? <br /><br />3. Do you think the entertainment industry or soft power is very important to a country? If yes, what should our government and private sectors do to improve our entertainment industry?<br /><br />4. Conversation practice question:<br />In your subgroup, each person please think of a question related to this article then ask your fellow group members.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">2  AMAZING RACE: TAIWAN! Is Taiwan Travel English Friendly?</span><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhnclTG2wNk&amp;t=79s" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhnclTG2wNk&amp;t=79s</a><br /><br />Questions:<br /><br />1. Traveling around the entire island or half of the island has become a very popular activity in recent years in Taiwan. Do you have any similar experience and if so, how was it? (For example, what kind of transportation did you take? where did you stay overnight? Which scenic place did you like the most? Do you have any recommendations about traveling around the island?) ** If you haven't had the chance to travel around the island, would you like to? What is holding you back?<br /><br />2. When you travel around the island or half of the island what was the biggest challenge for you and how did you overcome it?<br />If you haven't done it, please share some challenges you have faced when were traveling elsewhere.<br /><br />3. Taiwan will be bilingual by the year 2030. In Wes's video, he visited some English-friendly stores and restaurants. Do you think their services are English-friendly enough? Do you have any ideas for creating a qualified English- friendly environment in Taiwan?<br /><br />P.S.<br />1.參加三次後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />2.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12531">Danny Lin</a> — Wed Nov 03, 2021 1:43 am</p><hr />
