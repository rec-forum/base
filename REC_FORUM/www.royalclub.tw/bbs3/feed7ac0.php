How resilient are you?<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/features/6-minute-english/ep-200213">https://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/e ... /ep-200213</a><!-- m -->  <br /><br />Questions:<br />1.How do you usually deal with difficult situations, such as severe and sudden illness, financial crisis, the loss of beloved ones or breaking up with someone? Are you good at dealing with adversity? What’s your most successful experience in coping with adversity?<br />2.Why do some people cope with stress better than others? Before watching this video, did you think we are born with resilience or we can learn it? Why?<br />3.From the video, resilience can be bolstered from 3 levels: social support, positive thoughts and biological capabilities to stay calm? Are you equipped with the above 3 elements? Do you have any ideas regarding how to strengthen those elements?<br />4.Are you an early or late bloomer in terms of studying, career or intimate relationship, etc.? An old saying goes, &quot;Anyone who blooms at all, ever, is very lucky.&quot; What do you think about the saying? Do you think it’s still luckier to be an early bloomer? Why or why not?<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Session 2. Is it good to disagree?<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/features/6-minute-english/ep-200206">https://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/e ... /ep-200206</a><!-- m -->  <br /><br />Questions: <br />1.Have you seriously lost temper due to someone who disagreed with you? In your innermost thoughts, do you want your superiors, subordinates or your beloved ones to agree with you about everything? Please share with us your own stories/experiences.<br />2.Do you agree that“Disagreement is something normal”? Do you think it’s a necessary evil, or it is boring if everyone agrees with others about everything? Do you prefer divergence to boredom in this respect? <br />3.From the video, the dos and don’ts concerning disagreeing with others in a better way are: don’t try to take a higher position in the hierarchy, don’t contempt; do compromise, do speak truthfully and do listen intently. Among those tips, which one is the most difficult to you? Which one do you dislike the most? Which one is the most preferable and effective to you? <br />4.Are you a pedantic person focusing a lot on the small details or formal rules? If yes, why do you like to be this kind of person? If not, is it good to have such kind of person around us? Why or why not?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25437">Michael</a> — Sun Nov 08, 2020 10:45 pm</p><hr />
