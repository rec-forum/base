			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Session I: France bans extremely thin model</span><br /><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39821036" class="postlink">https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39821036</a><br /><br />A law in France banning the use of unhealthily thin fashion models has come into effect.<br /><br />Models will need to provide a doctor's certificate attesting to their overall physical health, with special regard to their body mass index (BMI) - a measure of weight in relation to height.<br /><br />The health ministry says the aim is to fight eating disorders and inaccessible ideals of beauty.<br /><br />Digitally altered photos will also have to be labelled from 1 October.<br />Images where a model's appearance has been manipulated will need to be marked photographie retouchée (English: retouched photograph).<br /><br />A previous version of the bill had suggested a minimum BMI for models, prompting protests from modelling agencies in France.<br /><br />But the final version, backed by MPs 2015, allows doctors to decide whether a model is too thin by taking into account their weight, age, and body shape.<br /><br />Employers breaking the law could face fines of up to 75,000 euros (£63,500; $82,000) and up to six months in jail.<br /><br />&quot;Exposing young people to normative and unrealistic images of bodies leads to a sense of self-depreciation and poor self-esteem that can impact health-related behaviour,&quot; said France's Minister of Social Affairs and Health, Marisol Touraine, in a statement on Friday, French media report.<br /><br />France is not the first country to legislate on underweight models - Italy, Spain and Israel have all done so.<br /><br />Anorexia affects between 30,000 to 40,000 people in France, 90% of whom are women.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion questions: </span><br />1.	What kind of negative impact do modeling industry leave on young people?<br />2.	What are the signs/symptoms of anorexia? Do you know anyone who has died from anorexia? How can we help them?<br />3.	Why do so many people think skinny equals beauty?<br />4.	If you could be anyone for one day, would you like to be a Victoria’s secret fashion model walking on a runway? <br />(Please refer to Bruno Mars - 24K Magic [Victoria’s Secret 2016 Fashion Show Performance] below.)<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSMB63GMfWM" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSMB63GMfWM</a><br />5.	Have you ever tried to lose weight? What have you done and which method do you think is the most effective? <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Session II: Why do 70 percent of lottery winners end up bankrupt?</span><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2016/01/why_do_70_percent_of_lottery_w.html">https://www.cleveland.com/business/inde ... ery_w.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />It seems difficult to believe: The lucky winners, possibly three, of Wednesday's $1.5 billion Powerball jackpot will probably go bankrupt within five years. In fact, about 70 percent of people who win a lottery or get a big windfall actually end up broke in a few years, according to the National Endowment for Financial Education.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How is that possible?</span><br /><br />&quot;People who were little, ordinary people all of a sudden become extraordinary,&quot; said Steve Lewit, CEO of Wealth Financial Group in Chicago. &quot;They're euphoric. They lose all sense of reality. They think they're invincible and powerful. They think they're Superman.&quot;<br /><br />The biggest problem, several finance advisers agreed, is that lottery winners give away too much money to family and friends.<br /><br />&quot;Once family and friends learn of the windfall, they have expectations of what they should be entitled to, and many of these expectations are not rational,&quot; said Charles Conrad, senior financial planner with Szarka Financial in North Olmsted. &quot;It can be very difficult to say no.&quot;<br /><br />The easy solution would be to rely on a third party to act as a gatekeeper, Conrad said, but many lottery winners don't turn to anyone to intercept the flood of requests from all of those &quot;close&quot; friends and relatives. The same thing often applies to professional athletes who get huge contracts, he said.<br /><br />Once new millionaires start giving money away, &quot;it's difficult to reverse course and turn off the spigot,&quot; agreed Westlake financial planner Scott Snow, who had a South Euclid client who won more than $100 million in the Mega Millions lottery a decade ago.<br /><br />Kevin Myeroff, a certified financial planner and CEO of NCA Financial in Mayfield Heights, said a shocking number of lottery winners don't get help from professionals such as a financial adviser or attorney. Or they surround themselves with the wrong people. And then they up giving too much money away and squandering too much on depreciating assets such as cars, vacations and gifts.<br /><br />It's compounded because, when you're talking about hundreds of millions or more than $1 billion -- what? -- it's virtually impossible to wrap your mind around what that amount means. You've heard the TV reports that you could stack $1.5 billion worth of $1 bills and it would reach 100 miles high. Or you could spend $30,000 a day and never run out of money.<br /><br />When someone has hit a jackpot or received a big inheritance, &quot;the recipient has no idea what that amount of money means to them,&quot; Myeroff said. &quot;If someone had $20 million and I asked them, 'Could you safely take out $10,000 per month or $200,000 per month to live on?' They wouldn't have a clue.&quot;<br /><br />Snow said newly wealthy people also often invest in businesses without scrutinizing them.<br /><br />Conrad said lottery winners may not pay enough attention to anything they put money into. &quot;They can invest in things that they don't understand and they do so without understanding the real risks involved,&quot; he said.<br /><br />&quot;If an investment has a lot of moving parts or can't be explained in simple terms, it probably isn't something they should be doing,&quot; Conrad said. &quot;Just because they now have a significant amount of money doesn't mean that they automatically become a sophisticated investor.&quot;<br /><br />To avoid financial woes and other problems, Snow said, lottery winners should surround themselves with a team of trusted advisers who can &quot;act as a sounding board.&quot;<br /><br />Lewit said that, six years ago, a good friend of his won $22 million in a lottery. In addition to hiring a financial planner, an accountant and an attorney, his friend hired a life coach &quot;to make sure he kept his head screwed on straight.&quot; Further, his friend doesn't make any major financial decision without consulting his team.<br /><br />With all of the pressures, it's no wonder that many lottery winners end up with costly addictions such as drugs or gambling, Myeroff said, that can burn through money.<br /><br />Lewit said lottery winners often think they have a bottomless pit of money and they spend, spend, spend without a care. &quot;These are obscene amounts of money,&quot; he said. &quot;But you can plow through money fast once you get in that lane.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It's natural to want to spend money on nice things once you receive a windfall,&quot; Conrad said. But if you don't have a budget, even for millions of dollars, &quot;it is very easy to lose track of how much you have spent. Many don't realize this until it is too late.&quot;<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion questions:</span><br />1.	If you won $10 million on the lottery, what would you do with that money?<br />2.	Do you know why many lottery winners are broke or in worse shape than before?<br />3.	If you won the lottery, who would you tell? Why?<br />4.	Do you have any methods to choose your numbers or would you have the computer choose for you? Any tips to increase your chance of winning the lottery? Please share your thoughts.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Agenda</span><br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />8:10 ~ 8:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:25 ~ 8:30pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:30 ~9:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~9:30pm Concluding remarks/feedback from newcomers<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The meeting place of Thursday:</span><br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第一區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
