Does “taking a gap year after high school” fit the culture of Taiwan?<br />2.	If you are a high school student, would you plan to take a gap year? What do you care most about?<br />3.	Do you have any real stories about “taking a gap year after graduation”?<br />4.	Is “taking a gap year” just for students?<br /><br /><br />Session 2: 2022 New Year's Yve Celebration<br /><br />What makes the Taipei New Year's Eve Celebration special is that it is different from the fireworks and performances put on by Sydney Australia, the second city to celebrate New Year' Eve, and also different from the countdown and lowering of the ball in Times Square in New York City.<br />At Taipei's 101 building when the countdown enters the final stage, the building itself lights up floor by floor from the bottom up for the New Year's countdown, making Taipei 101 the biggest New Year's Eve countdown clock in the world. After the countdown is over, fireworks are immediately set off, a star-studded group gathers on the spot to accompany a variety of activities and special ceremonies, and a special, exciting, out-of-the-ordinary Taipei New Year's Eve celebration is on display!<br />Although taking place in the winter with its low temperatures and frequent bursts of cold air, Taipei New Year's Eve celebration attracts more people the later in the evening it gets. Even if a cold snap hits, there is no drop in the enthusiasm of those welcoming in the new year. The Taipei city government, that runs the event, has made the concept of turning Taipei city into &quot;New Year City,&quot; the creative axis of the event. Since the staging of Taiwan's first-ever grand New Year's event in 1995, it won an enthusiastic response among young people and had the media competing with each other to report it, and this later spread throughout the entire country with similar celebrations being held everywhere.<br />On the day of the event, the Taipei city government will invite popular entertainers and famous pop singers to perform at the celebrations on the square in front of the government offices. At the same time, this glamorous New Year's Eve celebration puts Taipei squarely on the global stage, winning international applause and becoming one of the most famous international and Taiwanese New Year's events.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://eng.taiwan.net.tw/m1.aspx?sNo=0002019&amp;lid=080643">https://eng.taiwan.net.tw/m1.aspx?sNo=0 ... lid=080643</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Questions:<br /><br />1. How was your New Year's Eve? Are there any fond memories about New Year's Eve?<br />2. Have you ever been to see fireworks and shows near Taipei 101 or other places? How was it? <br />3. Why do people like to watch sunrise on New Year's Day?  <br />4. What are your plans/wishes for 2022? Read more, travel more? Or rescue Taiwan and the Earth? <br /><br /><br /><br />P.S.<br />1.丹堤咖啡有100元低消喔!<br />2.參加三次(含實體及線上會議)後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />3.請帶著開放與熱情來參加全英文會話聚會!</div>
