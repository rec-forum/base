Are they against it, hesitant, agnostic?<br /><br />But beyond knowing your audience, you have to appreciate the context in which you speak.<br /><br />The first thing about context we need to think about is the time.<br /><br />What time of day are you communicating?<br /><br />If you're talking early in the morning, you might have to have a little more energy to keep people moving.<br /><br />Context also involves emotion.<br /><br />Most of us when we communicate, we think about information: &quot;what's in my head and my heart I need to communicate to you?&quot;, but we also communicate a feeling.<br /><br />Maybe we're trying to get people excited and motivate them, but we need to think about the emotion as well as the information.<br /><br />The final bit of context has to do with &quot;where you're physically speaking?&quot;<br /><br />Think about the way the room is set up, think about the environment: is it live, is it virtual?<br /><br />Those change the way that you communicate.<br /><br />So our approach is important, our audience is important, the context in which we find ourselves is important, and so too is the way we structure our messages.<br /><br />In fact, we remember information up to 40% better when it's structured.<br /><br />The first structure is a chronological structure: past, present, future.<br /><br />Here's how things used to be, here's how they are today, here's where they're going in the future.<br /><br />The next structure happens to be the problem, solution, benefit structure.<br /><br />You start by explaining what the issue is, you talk about how to solve it and then the benefits to the people.<br /><br />Finally my favorite structure is the what, so what, now what structure.<br /><br />You start by telling people what the issue is, you tell them why it's important in that &quot;so what&quot; step and then you tell them what's next, what's coming.<br /><br />So I want for you bold communication that's confident and compelling, and I want for your message to echo long after you leave the room.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Q1. What tips or techniques can you learn from this video?<br />Q2. What are your tips to improve speaking skills?<br />Q3.

Now you can find dishes cooked by chefs at 'virtual' restaurants.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil.   <br />Georgina<br />And I’m Georgina. I’m going to order some takeaway food, Neil, do you want anything? Maybe a pizza?  Fish and chips? Indian curry? <br />Neil<br />Hmmm, takeaway food to eat at home – that’s a great idea. Yes, I’ll have a poké bowl, please. <br />Georgina<br />What’s that? It doesn’t sound like typical takeaway food. <br />Neil<br />It is nowadays, Georgina! Over the last few years the explosion of food delivery apps like Deliveroo and Just Eat has seen a revolution in takeaway food. Today it’s not just pizza and curries being delivered to people’s front door – there’s a wide range of food dishes and styles from all around the world. <br />Georgina<br />And with cafés and pubs closed during lockdown, more and more food chains and restaurants are switching to delivery-only services – takeaways – to bring meals to people who are isolating. <br />Neil<br />Over the last few weeks many takeaway companies have seen orders increase dramatically as people find themselves stuck at home due to the coronavirus pandemic. But what are they choosing to eat? That’s my quiz question for today, Georgina – last year what was Deliveroo’s most ordered dish? Was it:<br />a) Hawaiian Poké bowls?<br />b) Cheeseburgers?<br />c) Chicken burritos? <br />Georgina<br />I would have thought it was ‘fish and chips’, but I’ll go with b) Cheeseburgers. <br />Neil<br />OK, we’ll find out later if you were right. One consequence of the increasing popularity of takeaways is something called ‘dark kitchens’. Unlike apps such as Deliveroo and Just Eat which connect customers to local takeaways, these digital ‘dark kitchens’ work as just-for-delivery restaurants. Inside, chefs cook in kitchens without waiters, tables or diners, preparing high-quality dishes ready for delivery straight to your home. <br />Georgina<br />One of the first ‘dark kitchen’ operations, Taster, was started by chef Anton Soulier who in 2013 was working for Deliveroo when it was just a tiny company operating only in London. Now he’s in charge of twelve kitchens catering for customers in London, Paris and Madrid. <br />Neil<br />Sheila Dillon of BBC Radio 4’s The Food Programme went to the Bethnal Green area of east London find out more. <br />Sheila Dillon<br />When you go on the Taster website the restaurant names are virtual, all of them sold as ‘designed for delivery’ by Taster. What that means is all the menus, drawn up by serious chefs are designed to travel well, chosen so they’ll be warm, retain their texture and won’t look like a dog’s dinner when they come off the back of a bike. So strangely the delivery, the bike, has become a shaper of the foods we eat. <br />Neil<br />All the restaurants on Taster are virtual – existing online and created by computers to appear like the real thing. <br />Georgina<br />Chefs cook the dishes using recipes and ingredients designed to travel well - be transported a long way without being damaged or their quality being spoiled. <br />Neil<br />That’s to avoid the takeaway food ending up like a dog’s dinner - an informal way to say something that looks messy or has been very badly done. <br />Georgina<br />Usually the takeaways are transported in a box on the back of a delivery cyclist who rushes them from the kitchen to the customer’s home. It’s a very modern way of eating, which Sheila thinks has become a shaper of the foods we eat – meaning that it has a strong influence on how a situation develops. <br />Neil<br />However some are worried that the increase in takeaways and delivery-only food means people are losing basic cooking skills. It’s something that Taster boss Anton has noted too. <br />Anton Soulier<br />There is a strong underlying trend that maybe, in twenty, thirty years people won’t have kitchens – and it’s already happening in the US for example. I love cooking, it’s one of my passions but I’m rarely doing it - occasionally on Sundays and everything as it’s almost going to become a weekend hobby. <br />Georgina<br />People choosing to eat takeaways instead of cooking at home has become an underlying trend – a general development in how people behave which is real but not immediately obvious. <br />Neil<br />And in the future, cooking at home may even switch from being a daily necessity to a hobby – an activity someone does in their spare time for pleasure or relaxation. <br />Georgina<br />I do enjoy tucking into a takeaway sometimes but personally I couldn’t survive without my kitchen, Neil. <br />Neil<br />Ah, but could you survive without Deliveroo? Remember in today’s quiz question I asked you what Deliveroo’s most ordered dish was. <br />Georgina<br />I said b) Cheeseburgers. <br />Neil<br />But the correct answer was a) Hawaiian Poké bowls – a Hawaiian version of sushi. <br />Georgina<br />Now that’s something I couldn’t cook at home! <br />Neil<br />Today we’ve been discussing the revolution in takeaways and home-delivered food which in recent years has become an underlying trend  - a general development in how people behave, or in this case, eat. <br />Georgina<br />Another trend has been the creation of virtual restaurants – online restaurants which look like the real thing but exist only on the internet. <br />Neil<br />Chefs create dishes using ingredients which travel well - can be transported a long way without being damaged or spoiled. That’s so the customer doesn’t end up with a dog’s dinner - an informal expression meaning something messy or badly done. <br />Georgina<br />Recent developments like high-quality restaurant meals being delivered by bike are shapers of modern eating – things that have a strong influence on how a situation develops. <br />Neil<br />All of which means that cooking may soon become just a hobby – an activity someone does in their spare time for pleasure or relaxation, for example cycling… <br />Georgina<br />...or learning English. <br />Neil<br />That’s all we have time for today. Happy cooking and goodbye for now! <br />Georgina<br />Bye!<br /><br />Q1. Would you like to order food delivered to your home? Why or why not?<br />Q2. Why is eating take away food at home becoming a trend?<br />Q3. Do you think the kitchen will become unnecessary in houses of the future?<br />Q4. How is take home changing the restaurant industries and the choices they offer?</div>
