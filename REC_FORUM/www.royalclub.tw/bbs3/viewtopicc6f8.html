A recession may be around the corner. Don't panic<br />By Allison Morrow, CNN Business<br />Updated 1519 GMT (2319 HKT) May 6, 2022<br /><br />Around the world, warning signs of a recession are flashing.<br />Wall Street is on edge. Central banks are hiking interest rates to try to rein in inflation. And geopolitical upheaval is exacerbating supply chain headaches that began in 2020.<br /><br />&quot;We will get a major recession,&quot; Deutsche Bank economists warned last month, staking out the more bearish position on Wall Street. Bank of America, in the still-grim-but-less-dire camp, said the mood in financial markets has been &quot;recessionary.&quot; Goldman Sachs is among the more optimistic of the big banks, but it's not exactly cheery: The tight labor market has &quot;raised the risk of recession meaningfully,&quot; it said recently.<br /><br />What is a recession?<br />First, the textbook definition: A recession is a prolonged period of economic decline, beginning when the economy peaks and ending when it bottoms out. Recessions are typically marked by an economy shrinking in back-to-back quarters, measured by gross domestic product(GDP). <br />The reality of a recession feels is broadly economically gloomy — think rising unemployment, a stock market in decline, and stagnating or shrinking wages. People often rein in spending as gloom sets in, giving recessions a psychological component that can be hard to shake.<br /><br />How should you prepare?<br />First, don't panic: Even if a recession is inevitable, there's no telling how severe it will be. But it never hurts to plan for the worst. Here are a few ways financial advisers say you can insulate your finances from a downturn.<br /><br />Lock in a new job now: With ultra-low unemployment and plenty of openings, it's a job seeker's market. That could change quickly in a recession.<br /><br />Cash in on the housing boom: If you've been on the fence about selling your home, now may be the time to list. Home prices in the United States are up nearly 20% year over year, but mortgage rates are also rising, which will eventually curb demand.<br /><br />Set some cash aside: It's always a good idea to have liquid assets — cash, money market funds, etc — to cover urgent needs or unexpected emergencies.<br /><br />Don't trade on the headlines: Rapid-fire news reports about higher energy and food prices or talk of a potential world war or nuclear attack are unnerving.<br /><br />But making financial decisions based on an emotional response to current events is often a losing proposition.<br /><br />&quot;Making a radical change in the midst of all this uncertainty is usually a decision that [you'll] regret,&quot; said Don Bennyhoff, chief investment officer for Liberty Wealth Advisors and a former investment strategist at Vanguard.<br />Look back at periods of crisis over the last century and you'll see that stocks typically came back faster than anyone might have expected in the moment, and did well on average over time.<br /><br />Stay cool. Do your best. Then 'let go': Whatever the news today, building financial security over time requires a cool, steady hand.<br />&quot;Don't let your feelings about the economy or the markets sabotage your long-term growth. Stay invested, stay disciplined. History shows that what people -- or even experts -- think about the market is usually wrong. The best way to meet your long-term goals is just stay invested and stick to your allocation,&quot; Mari Adam said, Florida-based certified financial planner.<br /><br />Remember, too: It's impossible to make perfect choices since no one has perfect information.<br /><br />&quot;Collect your facts. Try to make the best decision based on those facts plus your individual goals and risk tolerance.&quot; Adam said. Then, she added, &quot;Let go.&quot;<br /><br />The article above contains two simplified articles as below: <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/06/economy/recession-explained/index.html">https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/06/econ ... index.html</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/28/success/money-moves-recession-geopolitical-unrest/index.html">https://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/28/succ ... index.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Questions:<br />1.
