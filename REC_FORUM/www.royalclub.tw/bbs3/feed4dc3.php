<span style="font-weight: bold">Session I: Simple Ways to Boost Your Self Confidence and Achieve Your Goals</span><br /><a href="https://tacklingourdebt.com/2014/06/10/simple-ways-boost-your-self-confidence-and-achieve-your-goals/" class="postlink">https://tacklingourdebt.com/2014/06/10/simple-ways-boost-your-self-confidence-and-achieve-your-goals/</a><br /><br />We all have times in our life when we feel inadequate and useless. Even if we have good jobs, manage a household, and successfully raise a family, we still feel like we just don’t quite measure up.<br /><br />We just aren’t as successful as we thought we would be by this point in our lives.<br /><br />We aren’t living in our dream house or earning the amount of money we thought we would be by now.<br /><br />All of those thoughts weigh heavy on our minds and the unfortunate part is that those thoughts prevent us from moving forward and achieving our goals and dreams.<br /><br />Here are five tactics to help you erase that doubt and become more confident:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">1.Let Go of Negative Criticism of Yourself</span><br />This applies to both past and present. Don’t let a jerk of a boss ruin your day by simply adding his voice to the tape player in your head. Realize that he may be taking his anger out on someone else because of his own inadequacies. People’s negative attitudes speak volumes about them, not about you!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">2.Prepare Yourself and Do Your Best</span><br />It’s not enough just to think positively; you have to actively pursue success as well. Visualizing your end goal can help you make the right choices, but no one can do the work except you.<br /><br />One way to overcome self-doubt is to write down your positive qualities.<br /><br />Make a list of at least five things you are good at. Every day when you wake up read the list. Reading aloud will also help you to believe the items you’ve listed.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">3.Set Reasonable Goals</span><br />Decide what you want to do within a set amount of time.<br /><br />Keep your goals realistic so you can meet them. If you set unrealistic goals that you can’t meet, you’ll quickly become discouraged.<br /><br />Start out small at first and get bigger with your dreams.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">4.Take Action</span><br />Inactive people easily become depressed. To avoid this unpleasant situation, immerse yourself in achieving your goals. Hard work will always pay off in the end.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">5.Celebrate Your Success</span><br />Self-doubters tend to think they don’t deserve to succeed. But you do!<br /><br />You deserve a reward for conquering your self-doubt and becoming more self-confident. You deserve to be honored for your hard work and perseverance.<br />Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.<br /><br />Just remember you can’t reach the top of a mountain in one giant leap; it takes many steps along the way to reach the peak in due time. The same is true of success and achieving your goals.<br /><br />Taking baby steps and achieving many small successes will bring you the confidence to reach your dreams. In the meantime, sit back and enjoy the journey to becoming the self-assured, happy and successful person you know you can be. It’s a wild ride, but it’s well worth it in the end.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion Questions:</span><br />1.What are the traits of a confident person? <br /><br />2.Do you think the 5 tactics listed in the article are useful? Explain.<br /><br />3.How do you boost your self-confidence?<br /><br />4.Do you think doing hard things or trying something new will boost your self-confidence? Why or why not?<br /><br />5.If you still think you are not good enough, what would you do to get this negative voice out of your head?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Session II: 7 Strategies Emotionally Intelligent People Use to Keep Their Feelings Under Control </span><br /><a href="https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/7-simple-strategies-that-will-help-you-manage-your-emotions.html" class="postlink">https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/7-simple-strategies-that-will-help-you-manage-your-emotions.html</a><br /><br />Our emotions influence practically every decision we make. <br /><br />Since most of the emotions you experience occur almost instinctively, you can't control how you feel in any given moment. But you can control how you react to those feelings--by focusing on your thoughts.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Here they are, seven specific strategies to help manage emotions:</span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">1. Pause</span><br />If you feel your emotions are getting out of control, take a pause. If possible, go for a short walk. Once you've had the chance to calm down, come back and decide how you want to move forward. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">2. Volume Control</span><br />If a discussion begins to escalate, focus your efforts on &quot;dialing it back&quot; by softening your tone or lowering your voice. You'll be surprised at how your partner follows your lead.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">3. Mute</span><br />Take a deep breath and remind yourself that both your mood and that of your communication partner are temporary. Remember that much of what they say at this point may be extreme or exaggerated; resist the urge to respond in kind.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">4. Record</span><br />As you tune into the other person, don't judge or offer advice. Instead, focus on learning more about how the other person sees you, how they see themselves, and how they see the situation.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">5. Rewind</span><br />Carefully think about where, when, and how to reintroduce the subject. <br /><br />For example, opening with an apology, an expression of thanks, or by acknowledging where you and your communication partner agree may lead the other person to lower their guard and become more open to whatever you have to say.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">6. Fast-Forward</span><br />Forget about how you feel in the moment. Ask yourself: How will this decision affect you in a month? A year? Five years? Doing so can help you think clearly, see the big picture, and make better decisions.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">7. Slow-Motion</span><br />The next time you're dealing with negative feelings or a bad mood, slow down and ask yourself why you feel the way you do. Can you take action to change a situation or circumstance and make things better? Or, can you ask someone for help?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Emotional health</span><br />We are emotional creatures. <br /><br />The key is not to take emotions out of the equation, but rather to find balance. It's about learning to harmonize rational thought with deep emotions, balancing &quot;brain&quot; with &quot;heart.&quot;<br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><br />Discussion Questions:</span><br />1.What are the characteristics of Emotionally Intelligent people? Do you know any emotionally intelligent people? Please share your observation about them?<br /><br />2.Which is more important in determining life success: IQ (Intelligence Quotient) or EQ (Emotional Intelligence/Quotient)? Explain.<br /><br />3.Which one/ones of the 7 strategies, do you think, is/are the most important to keep your emotions under control? Why? <br /><br />4.How do you control your emotions? Please share your experience.<br /><br />5.Have you ever hurt someone’s feelings, which made your feel regretful? And what lesson did you learn from it?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Agenda</span><br />7:00 p.m. --7:20 p.m. Free talk<br />7:20 p.m. --7:50 p.m. First topic discussion<br />7:50 p.m. --8:15 p.m. Presentation (At least two members of each table are invited)<br />8:15p.m.-- 8:45 p.m. Second topic discussion<br />8:45 p.m.-- 9:00 p.m. Presentation (Participants that haven't presented yet are invited)<br />speaker time: 2 minutes for each speaker<br />host time: 3 minutes<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The meeting place of Thursday:</span><br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第三區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=827">Jason Tang</a> — Thu Dec 05, 2019 10:19 pm</p><hr />
