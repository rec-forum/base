Teen arrested in US built handgun with online parts/Staff writer, with CNA<br /><br />US media on Monday reported that a Taiwanese teen arrested last week for allegedly threatening to shoot up his Pennsylvania high school had built a 9mm handgun with parts bought online and had more than 1,600 rounds of ammunition for various guns, also bought online. Sun An-tso (孫安佐), 18, had about 225 rounds of 12-gauge ammunition, 663 rounds of 9mm bullets, 295 rounds of AR-15 bullets and 425 rounds of AK-47 bullets, cbsphilly.com said, citing Upper Darby Police Department Superintendent Michael Chitwood. Chitwood’s department last week said that Sun’s school-issued iPad showed searches on how to buy an AK-47 or an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. Sun was arrested on Tuesday last week on charges of making terrorist threats after allegedly planning an attack on Monsignor Bonner and Archbishop Prendergast Catholic High School on May 1.The Archdiocese of Philadelphia told the CBS 3 television station that Sun has since been expelled, cbsphilly.com said. “In my opinion, based on the totality of everything, we certainly feel he was going to shoot down the school,” Chitwood told a news conference on Monday night. Sun is being held on a detainer lodged by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, meaning he cannot be freed on bail, which had been set at US$100,000, Chitwood said.<br /><br />Sun’s parents, actor Sun Peng (孫鵬) and Taiwanese gezai opera (歌仔戲) actress Di Ying (狄鶯), have maintained that he was joking when he talked about shooting up his school. The couple, who arrived in the US on Friday, visited their son at Delaware County Jail on Monday morning, accompanied by Robert Keller, one of two attorneys they retained to represent their son. Keller later told reporters that the parents were very emotional and cried during what he described as a “heartwarming” meeting. On Monday night, Keller and cocounsel Michael Kotik issued a statement: “This young man has had no prior contacts with the courts and has been considered an affable, precocious student with no discipline or antisocial tendencies... Our investigation reveals that there was no intention to terrorize or otherwise commit any criminal act. The family is concerned by the rising level of rhetoric that is being transmitted to the news media and hopes that the public will keep an open mind as all the facts and circumstances are brought forward. ”In other developments, Chitwood told reporters Sun An-tso’s host parent went to his bedroom and removed a 9mm Glock handgun and ammunition in a duffel bag before police arrived to conduct a search of her home. “She immediately went to the bedroom” after she was contacted by the school that Sun An-tso had made the threat to another student on March 26, he said. Police have declined to identify the host parent and there is no word if charges are pending against her.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Discussions: <br /><br />1.Do you agree to send your children to go abroad to study when they are in teenagers? <br />2.Do you think most of Taiwanese’ parents protect their children too much? Is it because of Taiwan’s education?   <br />3.If you are the parents, in which age you will let your children to be independent ?<br />4.If you are Sun’s parents , how do you rescue Sun? It may cost his parents an arm and leg to hire the experienced lawyer for the lawsuit.  <br /><br /><br /> <br /><br />“ Trade wars are good?” Two words: Great Depression, by Chris Isidore   @CNNMoney <br /><br /> <br /><br />President Donald Trump is itching for a trade war. No matter what you do for a living, that should scare you. In a trade war, countries impose tariffs and other barriers on imported products, often in retaliation for actions taken by a trading partner. That can slow down business activity around the globe by crimping international trade. In a worst case scenario, trade wars can lead to a global depression. Protectionist trade polices are one of the primary factors economists cite for deepening the Great Depression.So if there's one thing that most economists agree upon, it's no one wins a trade war. But President Trump doesn't believe that. He tweeted out Friday morning that for the United States, a trade war is &quot;good&quot; and &quot;easy to win. &quot;Here's how US businesses and consumers stand to lose if President Trump gets his wish for a trade war:<br /><br /> <br /><br />Prices will go up<br /><br />This much is certain. In a trade war, US consumers and businesses will be left with the bill.<br /><br />President Trump says he's planning to impose a 25% tariff on imported steel and a 10% tariff on imported aluminum. That means the price of cars, appliances, packaged food and everything else that uses steel or aluminum is bound to go up.<br /><br />Related: Trump's trade fight jolts Wall Street<br /><br />Even the aluminum industry's trade group admits the smelters remaining in this country cannot make enough additional aluminum to replace the supply coming from overseas. When the tariffs are put in place, imported products will continue to come in -- at higher prices.<br /><br />Since foreign steel and aluminum prices will be higher, domestic producers are likely to raise their prices as well.<br /><br />American businesses will lose sales<br /><br />Yes, America buys more from other countries than it sells to its trading partners. But don't discount the amount of goods and services the United States does export -- $2.3 trillion worth.<br /><br />A trade war by definition means that other countries are going to slap tariffs and restrictions on those US goods and services, making them more expensive, and less competitive -- if they're allowed into those countries at all.<br /><br />And once an American business loses a contract to sell its products overseas, it can take a long time to win that business back. Their customers will find other, perhaps more dependable suppliers while the trade war is waged.<br /><br />Many well-paying jobs are at risk in a trade war. In 2017, the United States exported $60 billion worth of auto parts, $56 billion of civilian aircraft, $52 billion of new cars and trucks, and $51 billion of pharmaceuticals.<br /><br />Related: Why steel and aluminum tariffs matter to the U.S. economy<br /><br />That's only goods. The United States has been primarily a service economy for decades now. Today about five times as many jobs are in the service sector, such as finance, media, transportation and retail, than are in goods producing sectors, such as manufacturing and mining.<br /><br />The good news is that the United States had a $243 billion services trade surplus.<br /><br />American trading partners are also among its biggest lenders<br /><br />The federal deficit is big and getting bigger. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the deficit could swell to $1 trillion by next year.<br /><br />Wall Street worries that the rising amount of debt could drive up the interest rates on the government debt, since the Treasury Department will have to offer higher rates to borrow more money. That would increase the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses, since many types of loans -- including mortgages -- track government bond rates.<br /><br />One thing keeping rates in check so far is the demand for US debt from overseas. America's foreign trading partners, including China, are among the largest buyers of that debt. It added $127 billion to its holdings last year and now owns more than $1 trillion in U.S. debt, making it the largest foreign holder of our debt.<br /><br />The trade deficit that President Trump decries is one of the reasons for those holdings. It gives foreign countries a powerful incentive to buy that debt, since they have to do something with the dollars they get back on those sales.<br /><br />If the trade gap shrinks, for whatever reason, China won't have as much incentive to buy US debt, and interest rates could rise significantly.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Discussions:<br /><br />1.China exports more to the United States than the US exports to China. That makes US is going to impose high tariffs to the goods from China. Do you know the conflict between these two countries may affect Taiwan?<br />2.According to the article, trade war means Great depression and it’s undoubtedly hurt both sides  or even all over the world. What do you think? <br />3.Have you even bought any US Treasury Securities or funds? <br /><br />Saturday's meeting place:<br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />tel: 2255-8132<br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=872">Shuman</a> — Wed Apr 04, 2018 8:27 pm</p><hr />
