Please share your story. If not, you can skip this question.<br />3.Would you like to have a 3D printer? Tell me what you think.<br /><br />Article II : 'Misleading' Colgate toothpaste TV advert banned by watchdog<br />LINK: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46618232">https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46618232</a><!-- m --><br /><br />A Colgate toothpaste TV advert which promised to &quot;instantly&quot; repair teeth has been banned for being &quot;misleading&quot;.<br /><br />Six complaints about the advert for Colgate Sensitive Repair and Prevent toothpaste were upheld by the Advertising Standards Authority.<br /><br />Parent company Colgate-Palmolive (UK) said the product provided a &quot;reparative layer on the enamel surface&quot; when used.<br /><br />It is the ninth Colgate-Palmolive ad to be banned in seven years, five of which were for dental products.<br /><br />The ad, which appeared on UK screens in August this year, claimed to instantly heal sensitive teeth if applied twice a day &quot;directly with [a] finger for one minute&quot;.<br /><br />Colgate-Palmolive claimed clinical studies showed the product repaired microscopic gaps in tooth enamel and it believed that the advert was clear that the claim referred to the product providing a protective barrier on the teeth in order to relieve pain caused by sensitivity.<br /><br />However, the ASA said that this was not the same as repairing the tooth and concluded the claim that it &quot;repairs teeth instantly&quot; was not substantiated.<br /><br />The watchdog ruled the advert must not appear again in its current form and that the company must not make similar claims &quot;unless they held evidence&quot; to back them up.<br /><br />It is the latest Colgate-Palmolive advert to be banned by the ASA.<br /><br />In 2014 the company had a commercial banned for suggesting one of its toothbrushes used &quot;sonic waves&quot; to clean teeth, which the ASA said was misleading.<br /><br />Other Colgate-Palmolive ads to be banned include one that the ASA ruled exaggerated how much whiter a toothpaste would make the user's teeth and another that featured an endorsement from a woman who said she was a nurse but was actually an actress.<br /><br />The BBC has asked Colgate-Palmolive why it has fallen foul of the advertising regulator but has yet to receive a response.<br /><br />Discussion :<br />1.Have you suspected that the doctor on TV might be fake?<br />2.Do you have a toothpaste brand that you are used to? Please tell us why you believe in this brand. Or how do you choose toothpaste?<br />3.Do you think people in TV commercials can be fake doctors or nurses?
