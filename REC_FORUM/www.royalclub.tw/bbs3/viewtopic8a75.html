Neurosurgery, said there would be concerns about how stem cell transplants might pan out in human Parkinson's patients, but the latest work had addressed some of the previous uncertainty about whether it was safe to use iPS cells.<br />He said &quot;Overall, the results they report in the short term are encouraging and provide some reassurance that these cells can function as sources of dopamine to address those movement symptoms of Parkinson's disease that relate to dopamine loss.<br />&quot;No-one expects that transplants will address the non-dopamine, non-movement aspects of Parkinson's disease such as dementia and falls, which ultimately emerge with very long-term follow up.&quot;<br /><br />科學家已經恢復了類似於帕金森病的病症，在猴子中被破壞的神經細胞。<br />日本隊希望他們的工作能夠在2018年底之前導致人類患者的干細胞試驗。<br />帕金森病導致釋放多巴胺的神經細胞的進行性喪失，這是一種有助於控制身體運動的化學物質。<br />研究人員引發了獼猴的細胞類似的損失，然後用人類幹細胞代替它們。<br />在將源自人幹細胞移植到大腦中的前體多巴胺神經元兩年後，動物的症狀顯著改善。<br />這些細胞 - 被稱為誘導多能幹細胞（iPS）細胞 - 是通過對普通成年細胞進行遺傳重編程而產生的，因此它們恢復到胚胎樣狀態。<br />在這種狀態下，它們可以被哄騙發展成許多不同的成體細胞類型 - 在本實驗的情況下，多巴胺神經元。<br />腦細胞治療“有希望”的帕金森病<br />帕金森病可能從腸道開始<br />“許多患者隱藏帕金森症狀”<br />來自京都大學的Takahashi教授的研究人員表示，“自然”雜誌上發表的作品表明，人造細胞與猴子大腦中自然產生的細胞一樣有效。<br />他說：“因為iPS細胞很容易獲得，我們可以使它們標準化，只能使用最好的iPS細胞進行治療。”<br />腦掃描證實，細胞正如預期的那樣起作用，並且不會引發可能與實驗性幹細胞療法相關的有害的免疫應答或癌性腫瘤的生長。<br />研究人員還發現，供體細胞的質量是關鍵因素，而不是每隻猴子收到的數量。<br />愛丁堡大學醫學研究委員會再生醫學研究中心的帕金森英國資助研究員Tilo Kunath博士說：“這是非常有希望的研究，證明在實驗室中可以產生一種安全高效的帕金森病細胞療法。<br />“這種治療有可能通過恢復其產生多巴胺的神經元來扭轉患者帕金森病的症狀。<br />“接下來的階段將是首次在人體臨床試驗中測試這些療法。”<br /><br />國立神經外科與神經外科醫院的Tom Foltynie教授表示，有人擔心幹細胞移植是否可能在人類帕金森氏症患者中出現，但是最新的研究已經解決了以前的一些不確定性，即使用iPS是否安全細胞。<br />他說：“總的來說，他們在短期內報告的結果令人鼓舞，並提供一些保證，這些細胞可以作為多巴胺的來源，以解決與帕金森病相關的多巴胺損失的運動症狀。<br />“沒有人會期望移植物將解決帕金森病如癡呆和跌倒的非多巴胺，不運動的方面，最終出現了非常長期的後續行動。”<br /><br /><br />Q1:請舉出帕金森氏症的症狀?<br />Q1:Please for example about Parkinson's disease symptom?<br /><br />Q2:得帕金森氏症的優點與缺點?<br />Q2:What is the advantage /disadvantage of get Parkinson's disease?<br /><br /><br />Q3:如何減緩帕金森氏症的方法?<br />Q3:How to cure Parkinson's disease?<br /><br /><br /><br />Peanut allergy treatment 'lasts up to four years'<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bbc.com/news/health-40960754">http://www.bbc.com/news/health-40960754</a><!-- m --><br /><br />An oral treatment for peanut allergy is still effective four years after it was administered, a study has found.<br />Children were given a probiotic, with a peanut protein, daily for 18 months.<br />When tested one month later, 80% could tolerate peanuts without any allergic symptoms and after four years, 70% of them were still able to eat peanuts without suffering any side-effects.<br />Food allergies have risen dramatically in recent decades, with peanut allergy one of the most deadly.<br />Lead researcher Prof Mimi Tang, of Murdoch Childrens Research Institute in Melbourne, said half the children were consuming peanuts regularly while others were only eating them infrequently.<br />&quot;The importance of this finding is that these children were able to eat peanuts like children who don't have peanut allergy and still maintain their tolerant state, protected against reactions to peanuts,&quot; she said.<br />Prof Tang said it was the first time a treatment for peanut allergy had been shown to be effective for this long.<br />The probiotic used is called Lactobacillus rhamnosus, which has been associated with preventing certain allergic symptoms.<br />When is it safe to eat peanuts?<br /><br />There is often confusion about when peanuts are safe as the guidelines used to advocate avoidance<br />Peanuts are now thought to be safe in pregnancy<br />If there is no family history of allergies or eczema then health officials say peanut butter and other ground or crushed nuts are OK after six months<br />If there is a heightened risk then parents should consult a doctor<br />This research suggests careful introduction of peanut may help such children, but parents should not do this on their own<br />No child under five should eat a whole nut<br />The Australian research team now wants to assess whether the treatment has improved the children's quality of life, as some 250 million people worldwide are affected by food allergy - a number which has more than trebled in the last 20 years.<br />Peanut allergy, which is one of the most common causes of death from food allergy, has increased at the greatest rate.<br />Prof Tang said the findings, published in The Lancet Child &amp; Adolescent Health, suggest &quot;the exciting possibility that tolerance is a realistic target for treating food allergy&quot;.<br />She added: &quot;This is a major step forward in identifying an effective treatment to address the food allergy problem in Western societies.&quot;<br /><br />花生過敏治療持續長達四年<br /><br />一項研究發現口服對花生過敏的治療在給藥4年後仍然有效。<br />兒童每天服用益生菌和花生蛋白18個月。<br />試驗後一個月，80％可耐受花生，沒有任何過敏症狀，四年後，其中70％仍然可以吃花生，沒有任何副作用。<br />近幾十年來，食物過敏症急劇增加，花生過敏最為致命。<br />墨爾本默多克兒童研究所首席研究員唐敏梅教授說，一半的孩子正在吃花生，而其他人吃的很少。<br />“這個發現的重要性在於，這些孩子可以像沒有花生過敏的小孩一樣吃花生，仍然保持寬容狀態，以防止花生反應。”<br />唐教授說，這是花生過敏第一次顯示有效。<br />使用的益生菌稱為鼠李糖乳桿菌，其與預防某些過敏症狀有關。<br />什麼時候可以安全地吃花生？<br /><br />當花生安全的時候經常會混淆，因為這些指導方針主張避免<br />現在花生在懷孕期間是安全的<br />如果沒有過敏或濕疹的家族史，衛生官員說六個月後花生醬和其他地面或粉碎的堅果是可以的<br />如果有更高的風險，父母應該諮詢醫生<br />這項研究表明，仔細介紹花生可能有助於這些孩子，但父母不應該自己去做<br />沒有五歲以下的孩子應該吃一個堅果<br />澳大利亞研究團隊現在想評估這種治療是否改善了兒童的生活質量，全世界約有2.5億人受到食物過敏的影響 - 這個數字在過去20年裡已經增加了三倍以上。<br />花生過敏是食物過敏死亡的最常見原因之一，以最大的速度增加。<br />唐教授說，“柳葉刀兒童青少年健康”發表的調查結果表明，“容忍是治療食物過敏的現實目標的令人興奮的可能性”。<br />她補充說：“這是確定有效治療以解決西方社會食物過敏問題的重要一步。”<br /><br /><br />Q1:Please for example about peanut allergy symptom?<br /><br />Q2:How to cure peanut allergy?<br /><br />Q3:Please for example you or your friend have any allergy symptom problem?<br /><br /><br /><br />Saturday's meeting place: <br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />tel: 2255-8132<br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
