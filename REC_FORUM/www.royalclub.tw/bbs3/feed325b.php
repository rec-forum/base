<span style="font-weight: bold">Host : William</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Article 1 : Emmanuel Macron is 39 and his wife is 64. French women say it’s about time</span><br />The Washtington Post  <br /><br />PARIS — Emmanuel Macron, the front-runner in Sunday’s French presidential election, shares something with President Trump: a 24-year age gap with his wife. The difference is that Macron’s wife is the older one. That cliche-busting fact — a candidate young enough to be his wife’s son, rather than old enough to be her father — is a little social “revenge” that delights many French women, including Martine Bergossi. “Why can’t we marry younger men? I date them all the time,” said Bergossi, the stylish owner of Alternatives, a secondhand-couture shop in Paris, who prefers to leave her exact age to the imagination. “It’s normal to see men with younger women,” she said. “So it’s rather great to see the opposite. ”France is famous for its laissez-faire attitude toward sex and love, yet the May-December romance between Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron has added a little ooh-la-la to a presidential campaign that is otherwise a deadly serious matter.<br /><br />Macron, a pro-European Union centrist, is facing off against far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, a blunt populist who rails darkly against immigration and threatens to yank France out of the European Union and NATO. Macron, a former investment banker, is 39, and his wife just turned 64.Macron was only 15 when he met Brigitte Trogneux, a married teacher at his high school in northern France who had three children. Macron’s parents sent him to Paris to put distance between the teacher who ran the drama club and their precocious son, but their bond lasted, she divorced, and 10 years ago they were married. Most of the French women interviewed said a politician’s private life is not a reason to vote for or against him or her. In the United States, too, Trump’s two divorces, considerable age gap with his third wife, and even a recorded conversation in which he lewdly discussed groping women did not prevent his electoral victory.<br /><br />But just days before the French vote, nearly all women interviewed did say they were more interested in Macron, who was a virtual unknown until recently, because his marriage breaks the mold. French politics has long been dominated by men with younger lovers. François Hollande, the current president, separated from his partner, Valerie Trierweiler, after a very public affair with an actress 18 years his junior. Former president François Mitterrand took a mistress half his age when he was in his 40s, a younger woman who famously stood near his wife at his funeral in 1996.“Did men ask anybody when they started marrying younger women?” asked Karin Lewin, an artist with a studio in Montmartre. “Who sets the rules?” She likes that Macron is shaking up the men’s political club. So do others. “Every single day, I see an older man with a woman his kids’ age coming into the hotel,” said Chloe Tournadre, 26, who works at a luxury hotel in Paris. Lilach Eliyahu, a fashion designer, said the fact that Macron has a wife who “has wrinkles and cellulite makes me think of him as a feminist. He is the opposite of Donald Trump.”<br /><br />Brigitte Macron is a grandmother and her husband has boyish looks. Melania Trump, who used to model here in Paris, is young enough to be the U.S. president’s daughter. The couples have nearly the same age gap: the Trumps were born 23 years and 10 months apart and the Macrons 24 years and eight months. Le Pen, if elected, would make history as France’s first female president, but men turned out in greater numbers for her than women did in the first round of the election, according to polls. In interviews, many women said that although they would like to see a female president, they were deeply concerned about Le Pen’s anti-immigrant, antiglobalist views and her party’s conservative views on women’s reproductive rights. Le Pen, 48, has been married twice. Her partner, a politician who has kept a much lower profile than Brigitte Macron, is 47.Cécile Alduy, a French professor at Stanford University who is in Paris this semester following the election, said that political spouses in France do not have the same public role as they do in the United States.“ It was so unusual and commented on” when Brigitte Macron joined her husband on stage after he won the first-round vote, Alduy said. Many women find it interesting that Macron is putting his wife in the spotlight, posing for photos with her, even appearing on the cover of a magazine with her in a bathing suit at the beach.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussions : </span><br />1. The huge age gap of the couples for the new president of France - Macron triggers a heated debate. What’s your opinion on it ?<br />2. France can accept the wife is older than the husband by 24 years. A lot of people may ask why we cannot accept it ? How about you ?<br />3. According to the report that Macron wouldn’t have been able to embark his life adventure and became a president of France without his wife. What do you think about it ? <br />4. Do you think that their example, with the wife far much younger than the husband, will be affected our traditional concept of the marriage?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Article 2 : 三分之一的人生：鍾瑩瑩 (Ying Ying Chung) at TEDxTaipei 2014</span><br /><br />Born and raised in a wealthy family, Ying Ying Chung had planned to pursue a career and lifestyle in music and arts, yet the plan did not go as expected. A phone call at age 26 forced her to return home and take up the never-thought-before Koi breeding business in the hopes to alleviate the family debt. Currently as the general manager of Sing Chang Koi Farm, Ying Ying has accumulated over 11 years of experience in Koi breeding, yet she still humbly calls herself as a trainee at the Koi Farm.<br />As many traditional Taiwanese industries were facing growth stagnation, the Koi business was no exception. Ying Ying decided to try her luck in the international market, and brought her fish to compete in overseas exhibitions. After several adverse incidents and clashes with her competitors, Ying Ying managed to pull through. Now, known as the Queen of Taiwanese Koi, she was awarded with 4 Koi Championship titles, and 11 Koi related awards in Holland in 2010.<br />Ying Ying once said during an interview, “I used to see eating the rib eye steak as the happiest time of my life, but now my happiness comes from challenging myself to the impossible.&quot;<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion :</span><br />1. With the young girl and without many experiences, how did Ying-Ying Chung become successful finally ? <br />2. Have you even had the experiences of failure in your life ? How did you cope with it at that time ? Share with us.<br />3. Do you think the 3 P ( persistence  , perseverance  &amp;  permanence ) are very important if you want to be successful ? <br />4. How do you transfer your mind from the bad to good when meeting the challenge?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=49">josh</a> — Tue May 16, 2017 2:05 pm</p><hr />
