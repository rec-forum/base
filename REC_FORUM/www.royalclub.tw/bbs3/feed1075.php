Do you usually win or lose?  What type of strategy, such as no strategy, win-lose, compromise or win-win, do you usually adopt?  What lessons have you learned from them?<br />2.Why are the four principles called ‘principles’ instead of ‘rules’? Why does ‘Separate the person from the issue’ matter? Is it easy to follow this principle when you negotiate with your family or friends? Why or why not?<br />3.Why should negotiation be interest-oriented?  Regarding Wang Leehom’s dispute with Lee Jingle, if they negotiate about their divorce agreement, what might be their respective interests? Is it possible for them reach a win-win solution instead of going to a court and publicly announcing the scandal?<br />4.Why are ‘Develop criteria that a solution must fulfill’ and ‘You should have different options to choose from’ important to a negotiation?  Any realistic examples to support these principles?<br /><br />_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />Session II: The Scientific Power of Meditation<br />Please watch the following video to learn about ‘The Scientific Power of Meditation’:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw71zanwMnY&amp;t=21s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw71zanwMnY&amp;t=21s</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The Effects of meditation are summarized as follows,<br />1.Decrease anxiety and depression. <br />2.Increase pain tolerance.<br />3.Increase memory, self-awareness and goal setting.<br />4.Increase empathy.<br />5.Reduce negative feeling, sadness and anger.<br />6.Changes the shape of the brain.<br />7.Slow down the heart rate.<br />8.Increase telomere length.<br /><br />Questions:<br />1.Have you meditated before? Why or why not? If yes, is your meditation experience positive? What pros/cons have you learned from it?<br />2.This video suggests that meditation greatly improves not only our mental health but also physical one.  How much do you agree with these points? Why? <br />3.Exercise also brings a lot of benefits to us, but it seems to conflict with meditation, which usually needs calmness or peace.  Can we do both of them together? If you are only allowed to choose one, which one do you prefer in order to be healthier? Why?<br />4.Besides personal health improvement, what other benefits can meditation bring us? Can you see any connection/relation between Harvard negotiation principles and meditation?<br /><br />P.S.<br />1.參加三次(含實體及線上會議)後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />2.請帶著開放的心與熱情來參加全英文會話聚會!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=13721">morris</a> — Fri Jan 28, 2022 5:16 pm</p><hr />
