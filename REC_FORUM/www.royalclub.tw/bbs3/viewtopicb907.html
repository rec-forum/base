			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Session I</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Number of children in Japan shrinks to new record low</span><br /><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/07/health/japan-child-population-record-low-intl/index.html" class="postlink">https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/07/health/japan-child-population-record-low-intl/index.html</a><br />May 7, 2018 <br /><br />Tokyo (CNN) The number of children in Japan has fallen for the 37th straight year in a row, a sign the country's attempts to offset the country's severely aging population are failing.<br /><br />As of April 1, 2018, there were 15.53 million children under the age of 14 in Japan, down 170,000 from the previous year, continuing a downward slide which started in 1981, according to data released by the Internal Affairs and Communications Ministry. <br /><br />The largest segment was also the oldest, with 3.26 million 12 to 14-year-olds, suggesting the downward trend isn't going to end any time soon.<br />Despite attempts by the Shinzo Abe government to encourage Japanese to have more children, only Tokyo reported more children compared to the previous year. <br /><br />Japan's total population currently stands at 126 million. Children made up just 12.3% of that figure, compared to 18.9% for the US, 16.8% for China, and 30.8% for India. <br /><br />According to the Japan Times, the government has been aiming to boost Japan's total fertility rate -- the average number of children each woman has in her lifetime -- to 1.8 by the end of 2025 from 1.45 in 2015, through one time cash payments and other incentives.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Economic issues </span><br />Japan has been struggling with low birth rates for decades, but unlike many other industrialized countries which have also seen native populations having fewer children, it has not been able to make the numbers up with immigrants. <br /><br />By 2060, the country's population is expected to plummet to 86.74 million from its current total of 126.26 million, according to a projection by the Japanese Health Ministry. <br /><br />With fewer workers paying taxes to support a growing silver population in need of pensions and healthcare services, Japan's economy is facing an unprecedented challenge.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><br />Can Japan survive without immigrants?</span><br />According to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), in 2013, the last year for which data was available, foreigners made up only 1.3% of Japan's population, compared to 7% for the US, or 16.1% for Estonia. <br /><br />The lack of new workers is heightened by Japan's woeful levels of gender disparity, a recent OECD report warned. While the ratio of boys to girls is relatively in keeping with most industrialized countries, there is currently a 25% gender pay gap in Japan, the third-widest of all member states, and women are often discouraged from participating in the workforce by a variety of factors including lack of childcare, discrimination, and sexual harassment. <br /><br />&quot;As Japan's elderly population is projected to reach nearly three-quarters of the working-age population by 2050, using all available talent in the labor market is key to overcome labor shortages,&quot; the report warned. <br /><br />&quot;This will require creating better work conditions for youth, incentivizing employment for the elderly, attracting foreign workers and closing gender gaps in job quality to promote the inclusion of women.&quot; <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion questions:</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Background information:</span><br />As early as 1993, the proportion of elderly people in Taiwan reached 7%, making it an “aging” society. This rate has reached 14% this year (2018), which means it has become an “aged” society. By 2025, more than 20% of the population will cross the threshold, making Taiwan a “super-aged” society, where one in every five people will be elderly.<br /><br />1.	What is the better pathway toward to offset the country's severely aging population?<br />2.	Facing the fewer children, what do you think children are the hopes or burdens for the country and young people?<br />3.	People often bring up social welfare system of Northern European Countries. Do you really think their system is better?<br />4.	Please share your perspective when you heard Taiwan is on the course to go from being an aged society (in 2018) “ to super-aged society <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Session II</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Children struggle to hold pencils due to too much tech, doctors say</span><br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/25/children-struggle-to-hold-pencils-due-to-too-much-tech-doctors-say" class="postlink">https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/feb/25/children-struggle-to-hold-pencils-due-to-too-much-tech-doctors-say</a><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Children need opportunities to develop hand strength and dexterity needed to hold pencils</span><br /><br />Children are increasingly finding it hard to hold pens and pencils because of an excessive use of technology, senior pediatric doctors have warned.<br />An overuse of touchscreen phones and tablets is preventing children’s finger muscles from developing sufficiently to enable them to hold a pencil correctly, they say.<br /><br />“Children are not coming into school with the hand strength and dexterity they had 10 years ago,” said Sally Payne, the head pediatric occupational therapist at the Heart of England foundation NHS Trust. “Children coming into school are being given a pencil but are increasingly not able to hold it because they don’t have the fundamental movement skills.<br /><br />“To be able to grip a pencil and move it, you need strong control of the fine muscles in your fingers. Children need lots of opportunity to develop those skills.”<br /><br />Payne said the nature of play had changed. “It’s easier to give a child an iPad than encouraging them to do muscle-building play such as building blocks, cutting and sticking, or pulling toys and ropes. Because of this, they’re not developing the underlying foundation skills they need to grip and hold a pencil.”<br /><br />Six-year-old Patrick has been having weekly sessions with an occupational therapist for six months to help him develop the necessary strength in his index finger to hold a pencil in the correct, tripod grip. <br /><br />His mother, Laura, blames herself: “In retrospect, I see that I gave Patrick technology to play with, to the virtual exclusion of the more traditional toys. When he got to school, they contacted me with their concerns: he was gripping his pencil like cavemen held sticks. He just couldn’t hold it in any other way and so couldn’t learn to write because he couldn’t move the pencil with any accuracy. <br /><br />“The therapy sessions are helping a lot and I’m really strict now at home with his access to technology,” she said. “I think the school caught the problem early enough for no lasting damage to have been done.”<br /><br />Mellissa Prunty, a pediatric occupational therapist who specialises in handwriting difficulties in children, is concerned that increasing numbers of children may be developing handwriting late because of an overuse of technology.<br /><br />“One problem is that handwriting is very individual in how it develops in each child,” said Prunty, the vice-chair of the National Handwriting Association who runs a research clinic at Brunel University London investigating key skills in childhood, including handwriting.<br /><br />“Without research, the risk is that we make too many assumptions about why a child isn’t able to write at the expected age and don’t intervene when there is a technology-related cause,” she said.<br /><br />But Barbie Clarke, a child psychotherapist and founder of the Family Kids and Youth research agency, said even nursery schools were acutely aware of the problem that she said stemmed from excessive use of technology at home.<br /><br />“We go into a lot of schools and have never gone into one, even one which has embraced teaching through technology, which isn’t using pens alongside the tablets and iPads,” she said. “Even the nurseries we go into which use technology recognise it should not all be about that.”<br />Although the early years curriculum has handwriting targets for every year, different primary schools focus on handwriting in different ways – with some using tablets alongside pencils, Clarke said.<br /><br />Karin Bishop, an assistant director at the Royal College of Occupational Therapists, also admitted concerns. “It is undeniable that technology has changed the world where our children are growing up,” she said. “Whilst there are many positive aspects to the use of technology, there is growing evidence on the impact of more sedentary lifestyles and increasing virtual social interaction, as children spend more time indoors online and less time physically participating in active occupations.” she said. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion questions:</span><br />1.	With the rapid advance in touchscreen technology used in cell phones and tablets, how will it influence our children’s ability to write and think? <br />2.	Technology conditions our brains to pay attention to information, which is quite different from the way we get knowledge through conventional reading. Why? <br />3.	Touchscreen devices are convenient to use. However, if young children overuse them, it will hamper their abilities to hold pencils. What should parents do to deal with this problem?<br />4.	How too much screen time and not enough other activities will impact our children’s behavior and mindset?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #0000FF">Agenda</span></span><br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />8:10 ~ 8:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:25 ~ 8:30pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:30 ~9:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~9:30pm Concluding remarks/feedback from newcomers<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #0000FF">The meeting place of Thursday</span></span>:<br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第一區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
