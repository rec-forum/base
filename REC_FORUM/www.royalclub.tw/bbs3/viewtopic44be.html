			<div class="content">3/2(Sat.) Do in Taiwan as the Taiwanese do! Seven Taiwan Taboos worth knowing about&amp; Should the Priority Seat Exist?(Host:Amy)<br /><br />Article I: Do in Taiwan as the Taiwanese do! Seven Taiwan Taboos worth knowing about<br />By: Taiwan Scene 2017-03-222018-05-30 ,Travel tips <br /><br />Though Taiwan is a thoroughly modern society built on reason and technology, vestiges of the old ways, or non-scientific customs and taboos from bygones days are alive and well in everyday life. Some may call these cultural taboos superstitions, but before being overly judgmental, consider the prevalence of triskaidekaphobia (fear of the number 13) in western architecture. While most Americans, for example, would laugh at the idea that this obscure phobia impacts their lives, the fact that many buildings – even modern skyscrapers – skip from the 12th to the 14th floor is evidence that the superstition is alive and well.<br />Here are a Seven Taiwan taboos you ought to know about when traveling in Taiwan.<br />1.Don’t point at the moon with your finger<br />Chang’e is the Chinese Goddess of the moon, and though luminous and beautiful, she’s also considered somewhat shy. According to legend, pointing at the moon offends the goddess, who may retaliate by cutting the pointer’s ear.<br /> 2.Knock on a hotel room before entering <br />Though it may seem strange to knock on your own hotel room door before entering, in Taiwan it makes sense. There may be spirits inside, and the knock is a courteous way to give them a moment to finish their business and vacate the premises.<br />3..Don’t stick chopsticks upright in a bowl<br />After praying with incense, Taiwanese people place the sticks upright in a brazier to allow both fragrance and prayers to ascend to the spirit world. Mimicking this gesture with chopsticks in a rice bowl in Taiwan is like making the sign of the cross with a french fry in a devoutly Catholic nation.<br />4.The color red is fraught with meaning<br />Everyone is happy to receive a hongbao, or red envelope, as this is how money is traditionally gifted. But if you see a red envelope lying in the street, picking that up may lead to an unwanted marriage with a ghost. Red is generally considered an auspicious color (gamblers will often wear red underwear for luck) but red ink should be avoided, as the ink symbolizes blood.<br />5.Never pat a gambler on the back<br />While in the west, patting your buddy on the back to congratulate them on winning (or console them for losing) is a perfectly normal gesture. Your Taiwanese gambling friends will not appreciate the gesture, however, as the Mandarin word for back (bei) sounds like a slang term for bad luck (also bei).<br />6.Avoid the number 4<br />What 13 is in the west, 4 is to Taiwanese. The Mandarin word for death (si) sounds the same as the word for “four” (si again). While some buildings have fourth floors, others do not (and rent in fourth floor apartments in those that do is sometimes discounted). Hotels and hospitals almost never have fourth floors. Also It’s considered inauspicious to give a gift containing four of anything.<br />7.Don’t give a clock as a gift<br />Gifting a clock is considered very bad luck, as if the giver is reminding the recipient of their mortality, as if to say “Your time is running out!” This said, should you chose to tip your tour guide with a Rolex GMT Master II (or even a mid-range Cartier) they’ll probably accept it quite happily, taboo aside.<br />Question : <br />1.	Among these 7 taboos, do you find any of them are still alive and prevailing in our life?<br />2.	Which taboos you believe the most and have you ever been cautioned by the elderly when you were a child?<br />3.	With the modern society, our life is changed by the technology. Should we still keep and believe the taboos?<br />4.	Have you ever done any taboos and did you get any bad luck? Share us your experiences. <br />Article II: Should the Priority Seat Exist? Jenny Zheng , May 22, 2017, by I Say You Say <br />Recently people are discussing whether to abolish the priority seat or not, because some people think the youngster should make way for the elderly. In my opinion, the priority seat should not exist, for yielding the seat is a virtue, not an obligation, and abolishing the priority seat could decrease unnecessary dispute. The most importantly, we should consider every seat the priority seat. Yielding the seat is a virtue, not an obligation. People should not be forced to do it. The signs on the MRT suggest to yield the seat to the elderly, the disabled, and pregnant women. But it is not our obligation to yield our seat if we ourselves are also in need of the seat to rest our tired or sick body. Everyone has the equal right on the public transportation. But in Taiwan, if we do not yield our seat, we would be chided by others. In Japan, people do not yield their seat on the public transportation because they think that is rude to tell people they are old enough to sit on the priority seat. And also they think that people should be responsible for themselves. Abolishing the priority seat could decrease unnecessary dispute. For example, everyone knows it is hard to have a seat on the Red 5 bus because there are many people going to Yanmingshan. And if you want to have a seat you should line up. One time, the bus was full of people as usual. There was an old woman getting on the bus but the bus driver told her to take the next bus because there were no more seats. The old woman said it was fine. She said she could sit at the stair. At the time, a middle-aged woman said, “Can anyone yield the seat to the old woman?” and no one answered. She harped on the young people’s flippancy, not yielding the seat to the old people. I believed that the students who chose to sit had their reason. We could not force people to yield their seat.    Actually, every seat is the priority seat. I saw many times that people yielded their seat to the people in need even though they were not sitting on the priority seat. And I do that too because I know some people may need the seat more than I do. Most people are kind and helpful. They would offer a helping hand to anyone in need, no matter they are told to do so or not.  We should not stereotype the priority seat. The priority seat can be taken not only by the elderly but also by the people who suffer from discomfort we may not see. I think that the government should advocate that the priority seat is offered to people who are in need, not only old people. Most importantly, we should realize that all the seats are priority seats which are for anyone in need.<br />Discussion:<br />1.	Are you in favor of abolishing the priority seat? What’s your opinion?<br />2.	Have you even yielded seats to the people? Share us your experiences.<br />3.	In Japan, the elderly don’t like to be yielded the seats. They are in the opinions that standing means “healthy”. Should we advocate the priority seat is for the people in need, not specially for the elderly? <br />4.	Everyone has the equal right on the public transportation since they pay the same ticket fee. Do you think it’s unfair for the youngsters to make a seat to the elderly?     <br /><br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:25pm discussion session <br />8:25 ~ 8:30pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:30 ~9:30pm discussion session<br />(Session III)<br />9:30 pm Free talk<br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
