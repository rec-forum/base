If you're not much of a music person, the enormous variety of genres and styles is overwhelming, to say the least. Instead of diving in randomly, ask a friend who's music choices you admire for a little help getting started. Everyone has different tastes, and the people that know you the best can help you find a few bands to start with.[1]<br />Ask questions when you hear songs that you like -- get the names of songs and singers to start building your preferences.<br />Ask yourself what types of music you like. If you can give your friends a few songs and bands, it will be easier for them to suggest similar bands.<br /><br />2 Input your favorite bands into internet apps that search for similar music. Pandora creates unique radio stations based on your preferences. Google Music finds songs based on mood and activity. Spotify has a series of recommendations based on past listening history. The amount of code written to help people find new music is staggering -- making it easier than ever. You just have to provide a few of your personal favorites to get things started.<br />Many playback programs, like iTunes, offer recommendation services as well. On iTunes, this is through the &quot;Genius&quot; setting.[2]<br /><br />3 See bands performing live, and give the warm-up acts a chance. Live music is often an unknown band's best chance to earn new fans. Going out to real shows is an incredible way to expand your musical library, and you can often meet the bands or pick up merchandise as well. Going to live music lets you feel out songs in real time, as well as get in touch with great, up and coming bands that would be almost impossible to find online.<br /><br />4 Know where to find free music. There is free music everywhere these days, as long as you know where to dig. Spotify, Pandora, YouTube, SoundCloud, and more sites have free options, allowing you to listen in with a few commercials. Tech-savy audiophiles can use torrenting sites to get music, as long as they know the legal risks.[3]<br /><br />Don't have technology? Head to your local library and check out a few CDs.<br />Swapping music with friends, either through Dropbox, mixed CDs, or external hard drives, is easier and easier in the digital age. Simple copy the songs into the folder &quot;My Music&quot; → &quot;Automatically Add to iTunes,&quot; or a similar folder for your program.[4]<br /><br />5 Listen to genres that are new to you or that you want to understand better. Try a light opera, or perhaps a show tune, played by an orchestra or just on piano. Do not think of anything else. This is a time to listen, enjoy and relax. You are going to try to develop a mental map of the music -- and that extends across all genres.<br />All genres of music borrow from others. From the &quot;rock opera&quot; and oldies-sampling hip-hop beats to the reggae/punk lovechild known as &quot;ska,&quot; you'd be surprised how often influences from dissimilar genres bleed over.<br /><br />6 Stand true to the personal preferences and habits you enjoy when listening to music. Music is subjective. If you like a song, then that is more than enough. Too often people feel like they feel &quot;guilty&quot; about a band or song, or try to follow bands they don't enjoy. Stick to your guns -- if you like the band, listen to them.[5]<br /><br /><br />for more detail, please click on the link<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.wikihow.com/Listen-to-Music">https://www.wikihow.com/Listen-to-Music</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br />Discussion:<br />1. What? Is listening to music a difficult thing? Why we need to learn the how? <br />2. what is music mean something for you? How do you listen music?  Will you invest for it?<br />3. Do you like old song which remind you something of your childhood? What is it?<br />4. when you go to café’, do you like the music they play? <br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Session 2: 7 Tiny Steps for the Beginner Minimalist<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://bemorewithless.com/begin/">https://bemorewithless.com/begin/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />1. Write it down. Make a list of all the reasons you want to live more simply. If you are sick of debt collectors, write it down. Mad that you never get any time with your kids? Write it down. To stressed out to sleep at night? Put it on paper. Want to fire your boss? Yep, write that down too. These are your whys and your whys will provide great leverage when you think it’s too hard to keep going. Your whys will help you remember what matters.<br /><br />2. Discard the duplicates. Walk through your home with a box and fill it with duplicates. If you have two sets of measuring cups, put them in the box. Copies of the same book or DVD? Put one in the box. Doubles on place mat sets? You only need one. Once you fill the box, label it “Duplicates” and put it out of sight for 30 days. If you don’t need anything or don’t remember what was in the box, donate it.<br /><br />3. Declare a clutter-free zone. This area could be a kitchen table, your nightstand, a countertop or a drawer in your kitchen. Use that clutter-free zone as inspiration to live with less. If you enjoy that clean, clear environment, expand the zone a little bit each day. A clutter-free countertop can become a clutter-free room and a clutter free room can become the clutter-free, minimalist home you’ve been thinking about.<br /><br />4. Travel lightly. Travel always renews my love of minimalism and living simply. The next time you take a trip, pack for 1/2 the time. If you are traveling for 4 days, pack for 2. You can wash and hang clothes if you need to or wear the same things twice. See how it feels to carry less baggage.<br /><br />5. Dress with Less. If you haven’t considered Project 333, dressing with only 33 items for 3 months (clothes, shoes, jewelry, accessories) sounds extreme, but thousands of people know that it actually makes life easier instead of more challenging.<br /><br />6. Eat similar meals. When you think about how much time you spend thinking about what you are going to eat for lunch, make your family for dinner, or what you need to pick up at the grocery store, it’s clear that food is not always simple. Try eating the same breakfast and lunch all week and have 2 or 3 dinner choices that rotate throughout the week. If your family complains, let them know it’s an experiment and then talk about it at the end of the week.<br /><br />7. Save $1000. An emergency fund simplifies everything. If you are paying off debt, only pay your minimum payments until you can save $1000. If you aren’t in debt, but still spend what you have, set aside money every day or every week until you reach $1000. Try the 52 week money challenge and in 45 weeks, you’ll save more than $1000 without ever contributing more than $45 in a week. Money for emergencies reduces stress and emergencies.<br /><br />Try these one at a time and continue to take tiny steps and lean into the life you crave. Even if it takes 10 years to get to where you think you want to be, the benefits begin immediately.<br /><br />The beauty of being a beginner minimalist is that you can be curious, and daring. You can ask for help, get back up if you fall, and look forward to new adventures in a life with less stuff, drama, debt, and obligation.<br /><br /><br />Discussion:<br />1. what is Minimalist?<br />2. Is there any advantage to learn as a minimalist?<br />3. Do you feel you are  always lack of space at home?  And how do you declutter your room?.<br />4. Share some story  about your duplicates at home? Does it bother you?<br />P.S.<br />1.因疫情關係，聚會方式改為線上遠距。<br />2.參加三次後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />3.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~</div>
