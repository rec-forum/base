You’ll find the answer to this age-old question (pun intended) in Japan. The Japanese life expectancy is the world’s highest, at 87.32 years for women and 81.25 years for men. The average lifespan of the Japanese is the highest it has ever been, and they keep getting older. In 2019, the number of Japanese aged 90 reached 2.31 million, including over 71,000 centenarians. So have the Japanese found the fountain of youth? We delve into Japan’s top secrets to good health and longevity.<br /><br />Questions:<br />1. Do you think to live over 100-year-old? Share your thought and feeling about this article. Which part is impressed you most?<br />2. How do you measure whether a happy life is a long life, a meaningful value or others?<br />3. According to your observation, what is different between Taiwanese and Japanese diet or lifestyle?<br />4.

Books-2020</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Most of my conversations and meetings these days are about COVID-19 and how we can stem the tide. But I’m also often asked about what I am reading and watching—either because people want to learn more about pandemics, or because they are looking for a distraction. I’m always happy to talk about great books and TV shows (and to hear what other people are doing, since I’m usually in the market for recommendations).<br />So, in addition to the five new book reviews I always write for my summer book list, I included a number of other recommendations. I hope you find something that catches your interest.<br /><br />Questions:<br />1. After the covid-19 outbreak, what activities will you arrange this summer?<br />2. Do you usually have the habit of reading? Usually, how many books do you read in a month? Share your motivation or purpose for reading<br />3. What kinds of books do you like? (Ex: novels, science, business, health…) Please share a book you like and how this book has affected and changed you?<br />4. Share any TV shows, series or movies impressed you on weekends?</div>
