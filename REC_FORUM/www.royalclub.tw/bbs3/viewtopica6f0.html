Marjorie North offers 10 tips for speakers to calm the nerves and deliverable memorable orations.<br />1. NERVOUSNESS IS NORMAL. PRACTICE AND PREPARE!<br />All people feel some physiological reactions like pounding hearts and trembling hands. Do not associate these feelings with the sense that you will perform poorly or make a fool of yourself. Some nerves are good. The adrenaline rush that makes you sweat also makes you more alert and ready to give your best performance.<br /><br />The best way to overcome anxiety is to prepare, prepare, and prepare some more. Take the time to go over your notes several times. Once you have become comfortable with the material, practice—a lot. Videotape yourself, or get a friend to critique your performance.<br /><br />2. KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE. YOUR SPEECH IS ABOUT THEM, NOT YOU.<br />Before you begin to craft your message, consider who the message is intended for. Learn as much about your listeners as you can. This will help you determine your choice of words, level of information, organization pattern, and motivational statement.<br /><br />3. ORGANIZE YOUR MATERIAL IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE MANNER TO ATTAIN YOUR PURPOSE.<br />Create the framework for your speech. Write down the topic, general purpose, specific purpose, central idea, and main points. Make sure to grab the audience’s attention in the first 30 seconds.<br /><br />4. WATCH FOR FEEDBACK AND ADAPT TO IT.<br />Keep the focus on the audience. Gauge their reactions, adjust your message, and stay flexible. Delivering a canned speech will guarantee that you lose the attention of or confuse even the most devoted listeners.<br /><br />5. LET YOUR PERSONALITY COME THROUGH.<br />Be yourself, don’t become a talking head—in any type of communication. You will establish better credibility if your personality shines through, and your audience will trust what you have to say if they can see you as a real person.<br /><br />6. USE HUMOR, TELL STORIES, AND USE EFFECTIVE LANGUAGE.<br />Inject a funny anecdote in your presentation, and you will certainly grab your audience’s attention. Audiences generally like a personal touch in a speech. A story can provide that.<br /><br />7. DON’T READ UNLESS YOU HAVE TO. WORK FROM AN OUTLINE.<br />Reading from a script or slide fractures the interpersonal connection. By maintaining eye contact with the audience, you keep the focus on yourself and your message. A brief outline can serve to jog your memory and keep you on task.<br /><br />8. USE YOUR VOICE AND HANDS EFFECTIVELY. OMIT NERVOUS GESTURES.<br />Nonverbal communication carries most of the message. Good delivery does not call attention to itself, but instead conveys the speaker’s ideas clearly and without distraction.<br /><br />9. GRAB ATTENTION AT THE BEGINNING, AND CLOSE WITH A DYNAMIC END.<br />Do you enjoy hearing a speech start with “Today I’m going to talk to you about X”? Most people don’t. Instead, use a startling statistic, an interesting anecdote, or concise quotation. Conclude your speech with a summary and a strong statement that your audience is sure to remember.<br /><br />10. USE AUDIOVISUAL AIDS WISELY.<br />Too many can break the direct connection to the audience, so use them sparingly. They should enhance or clarify your content or capture and maintain your audience’s attention.<br /><br />Questions:<br />1.	Would you please share that you have been worried and afraid when speaking or expressing opinions in public? What methods did you use to overcome it? <br />2.	Who are your favorite speakers? How did you use as role models as you develop your stage presence and prep for speeches and presentations? Please share the stories that have made you the most memorable public speaking? <br />3.

What goals do you expect to achieve in public speeches in the future?<br /><br />Session II: 5 diet swaps that will protect your heart<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/articles/prevent_heart_disease">https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/articles/pre ... rt_disease</a><!-- m --><br />There are 5 diet changes we can all make to protect ourselves from heart disease and stroke, whatever our age, according to a new report released by the British Nutrition Foundation.<br />Heart disease is responsible for 1 in 4 premature deaths in the UK and most cases are preventable.<br />The report identifies a healthy gut microbiome and watching your waist size, as well as keeping as your blood pressure and cholesterol levels down, as key factors that may stave off heart disease.
