				<div class="content">Host: Howard<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Session 1</span><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6x1XFPTgNsE" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6x1XFPTgNsE</a><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Death Penalty</span><br />This time we're not going to debate whether we should abolish death penalty or not, because it's a cliched article! This time I try to divert victims' families' minds from sorrow and pain. I sincerely invite them to join us to relief their hatred , comfort their mood.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions for Discussion</span><br />1. Stand-up comedy is used to entertain the audience.  A large audience around George Carlin was echoed by him. Do  you feel  soothing after you watch this video clip?<br />2. Ancient Chinese  lingering deaths (凌遲)  are also versatile  , share us one that is  not inferior  to  &quot;  crucify people upside down  and naked.&quot; Try your best not to horrify female members but show your black humor.<br />3.George Carlin said ,&quot; drug dealers aren't afraid to die, they're already killing each other every day<br /> on the streets by the hundreds drive-bys , gang shootings. They're not afraid to die. Death penalty doesn't mean anything unless you use it on people who are afraid to die like the bankers who launder the drug money..............you want to slow down that drug traffic you got to start executing<br /> a few of these fucking bankers........&quot;  But it's unfair  to these bankers, I think. You think how to deal with drug dealers to patch up George's speech?<br />4. George  wanna fry  Jeffrey Dahmer into tempura thing, what's your interesting thought to deal with serial killer / sex offender?<br /><br />................................................................................................<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Session 2 </span><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RIOFzhufm8" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RIOFzhufm8</a><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The Bucket List (1/4) Movie CLIP - Skydiving (2007) HD</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions for Discussion</span><br />1.Former US President George Bush Sr tried a skydiving to mark his 90th birthday. Have you ever tried skydiving? What's the feeling?<br />2.Their bucket list is go skydiving , drive a Shelby Mustang, fly over the North Pole, eat dinner at Chevre d'or in France, visit and praise the beauty and history of Taj Mahal, India, ride motorcycles on the Great Wall of China, attend a lion safari in Tanzania and ..................................<br />Which item(s) do you love most? What's your own bucket list?  Why do you list these items? What item is your first priority to accomplish and why?<br />3.  Carter and Edward cooperate and help each other to accomplish the bucket list . Do you think in the practical situation mission will be ( a. easy b.impossible c.complicated d. your answer)<br />4.They're lucky enough that they can still walk and see . Most important key is Edward has much money. Some poor guys can't move and don't have money or even no son and daughter. What bucket list is best for these persons?</div>
