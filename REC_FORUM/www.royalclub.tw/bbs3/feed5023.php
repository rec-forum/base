05/15(Sat.)Chinese Medicine vs Western Medicine/Bill and Melinda Gates to Divorce(Host:Amy)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Article1:Chinese Medicine vs Western Medicine</span><br /><br />Chinese medicine is a system of health care developed thousands of years ago. Western medicine, while quite ubiquitous in the United States, is a much more recent phenomenon. &quot;The development of medicine in Western nations follows the way of hypothetical deduction and the Eastern approach uses the inductive method,&quot; writes Dr. Julia J. Tsuei for the National Center for Biotechnology Information. &quot;The Western approach clearly divides the health from the disease, yet the Eastern approach considers health as a balanced state versus disease as an unbalanced state.&quot; Whether you are looking for alternative or complimentary treatments to those offered by mainstream medical providers or are considering a career in in holistic health, it helps to understand some of the differences in Chinese medicine vs Western medicine. To learn more about some attributes of each system, read on.<br /><br />Divergent approaches to patient exams<br /><br />While a doctor of Western medicine might be most interested in vital signs like weight, height, body temperature, blood pressure and so on, as well as signs of disease, the Chinese medicine doctor will examine the whole person. A practitioner might be just as interested in a person's physical issues as in other aspects of their lives, including their relationships with family, life stresses or spiritual state. A doctor of Western medicine might treat two patients suffering the same ailment in the same way, while Chinese medicine practitioners would understand that each patient is an individual. &quot;What makes Eastern medicine so different than Western is that instead of prescribing a 'one size fits all' for all patients with certain symptoms, Eastern medicine looks at the needs of each individual and unique body and acts accordingly,&quot; according to Gaia. &quot;In essence, it’s a short-term versus long-term action plan.&quot;<br /><br />Differences in diagnostic practices <br /><br />Practitioners of Chinese medicine understand the world and the human body in terms of five essential elements:<br /><br />•Wood<br />•Fire<br />•Earth<br />•Metal<br />•Water<br /><br />These substances are aspects of the qi, or chi — or the life force energy — that flows within the body. Each person is made up of a unique balance of these elements, which are each associated with different seasons, colors and organs in the body. When the elements become unbalanced of the flow of qi is impeded, health problems occur. The therapies used by practitioners of Chinese Medicine aim to restore flow and balance. The treatments also aim to help facilitate the body's own ability to heal itself. Some of the methods Chinese medicine uses to correct imbalances and create harmony:<br />•Diet therapy<br />•Acupuncture<br />•Massage<br />•Herbal remedies<br />•Chinese exercise<br />•Meditation<br /><br />Western medicine often relies on pharmaceutical therapies to address health issues, while Chinese medicine relies on more natural substances. Some patients opt for a combination of Chinese and Western medicine, and it's a good idea to share with your practitioner or provider all the treatments and therapies you use.

In a joint statement posted to Bill’s Twitter account, the couple stated that they put in a “great deal of thought” and a lot of work into their relationship, but eventually decided to end the marriage. Gates pointed out that during the course of their relationship, the couple raised three incredible children and established a foundation that helps people across the world to lead productive and healthy lives. The Bill and Melinda Gates foundation has provided grants totaling $54.8 billion since its inception back in 2000. “We continue to share a belief in that mission and will continue our work together at the foundation, but we no longer believe we can grow together as a couple in this next phase of our lives. We ask for space and privacy for our family as we begin to navigate this new life,” Bill Gates posted on Twitter.<br /><br />The couple first met in 1987 at a New York City sales meeting, after Melinda joined Microsoft as a product manager. They soon discovered that they shared a love of puzzles, and ended up tying the knot seven years later in 1994. Bill was 38 years old at the time, while Melinda was 29. When their first child was born, Melinda decided to be a stay-at-home mom and leave the company, a decision that apparently shocked Bill. The couple’s three children are Phoebe, Rory, and Jennifer, who are 18, 21, and 25 years old. “But then my view changed over time when I felt like I had created the environment where I could give my kids privacy and let them grow up to be themselves. We had the values, we had people around us who were also imparting those same values that we had. Then I felt, like, ‘OK, I do want to work, and I will be a working mum.’ The one thing I’ll say about Bill is he was incredibly supportive all along the way,” Melinda said in an interview with Business Insider. <br /><br />The fourth richest man in the world, Bill Gates is estimated to have a net worth of more than $130.5 billion. The couple filed a petition to dissolve the marriage in the King County Superior Court in Seattle, and Melinda will not be seeking spousal support according to divorce papers she filed. While the couple did not sign a prenuptial agreement, they have agreed to a separation contract dividing their joint assets. The couple’s main home in Washington is a 66,000 square foot mansion that is estimated to be worth around $125 million. They own two ranches, one in Wyoming worth $9 million and another in Florida worth $59 million. They also have two homes in California worth $18 million and $43 million. Although the couple will continue to collaborate through their foundation, David Callahan, editor of Inside Philanthropy, believes that Melinda will also pursue her own philanthropic projects. “There’s no particular reason to think that anything will change with the foundation and its work. It has a large endowment. It has a professional staff of 1,600 people. It has a set of really well-developed programs,” Callahan said to the Los Angeles Times.<br /><br />“To me, the big question is, does Melinda get a sizable divorce settlement? And if so, what does she do in terms of forging her own path as an independent philanthropist,” he said. Callahan believes that Melinda may focus on projects promoting women’s empowerment, which has been one of the foundation’s top priorities over the past five years. Callahan pointed out that the Gates foundation usually writes an annual letter signed by Bill Gates. However, Melinda’s name also started appearing in the letters a few years ago, indicating that she had started to play a bigger role in the foundation. Preceding the Gates’ divorce, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Scott separated in 2019. Scott received Amazon stock valued at around $36 billion at the time of the divorce, and donated over $4 billion to charities during a four-month period last year.

Are you shocked by the divorce of such rich couple ?<br />2.Although the couple mentioned that they would continue to collaborate through their   foundation, do you think it will affect the charity operation and follow to affect the world (The foundation focus on improving sanitation, everything from brandishing a jar of poo on stage to drinking water , helping children died of preventable diseases every year in poorer counties etc.).                                                                           <br />3.If you were Gill Gate’s children, what would you do?<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">///////////////////////////////////////////////////////<br />Agenda<br />7:00 ~ 7:30 pm greetings &amp; free talk<br />7:30 ~ 8:15 pm guests introduced &amp; first session discussion<br />8:15 ~ 8:45 pm presentation, sharing the article &amp; other experiences<br />8:45 ~ 9:30 pm second session discussion<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven,<br />板橋民生路二段237 號,<br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30,<br /><br />P.S.<br />1.因聚會地點是在咖啡店內，所以有低消80元喔！<br />2.參加三次後，只要繳交1000元 (學生:500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />3.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~</span><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12531">Danny Lin</a> — Tue May 11, 2021 12:29 am</p><hr />
