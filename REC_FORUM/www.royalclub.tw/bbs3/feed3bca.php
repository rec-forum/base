That was the year after Taiwan’s economy struggled during the global financial crisis.<br /><br />A recent CIA report ranked Taiwan last out of 227 countries and territories for total fertility rate, the average number of children expected to be born per woman during their childbearing years.<br /><br />One of the areas the government is looking at is improving fertility treatment.<br /><br />Su wrote on Facebook that about 18,000 women in Taiwan receive treatment for infertility per year, and the government is studying the feasibility of expanding the NHI program to cover infertility.<br /><br />The Executive Yuan statement said that Su has instructed the Ministry of Health and Welfare and the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics to propose a plan in the next two weeks for subsidizing infertility treatment, the statement said.<br /><br />Meanwhile, to create a supportive child-rearing and work environment, Su said that he would instruct the Ministry of Labor to learn from other countries, and consult with businesses to establish more flexible working hours and allow unpaid parental leave.<br /><br />Question:<br />1.Is low fertility really a problem?<br />2.What causes low or high birth rate?<br />3.What can Governments do about falling Birth Rates?<br />4.How much does it cost to raise a child ?<br /><br /><br />Pursuing Happiness in the Workplace<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://tw.voicetube.com/v3/videos/159215">https://tw.voicetube.com/v3/videos/159215</a><!-- m --><br />Question<br />1.Does current job make you happy?<br />2.What is the ideal workplace?<br />3.What kind of things make you unhappy at workplace?<br /><br />//////////////////////////////////////////////////////<br /><span style="color: #FF0000">Agenda<br />7:00 ~ 7:30 pm greetings &amp; free talk<br />7:30 ~ 8:15 pm guests introduced &amp; first session discussion<br />8:15 ~ 8:45 pm presentation, sharing the article &amp; other experiences<br />8:45 ~ 9:30 pm second session discussion<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven,<br />板橋民生路二段237 號,<br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30,<br /><br />P.S.<br />1.因聚會地點是在咖啡店內，所以有低消80元喔！<br />2.參加三次後，只要繳交1000元 (學生:500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />3.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~</span><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=872">Shuman</a> — Sat May 15, 2021 9:37 pm</p><hr />
