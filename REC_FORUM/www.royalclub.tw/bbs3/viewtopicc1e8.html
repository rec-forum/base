Or maybe you just love to belt out a song at the local Karaoke night. It might surprise you to know that you’re not just having fun, you’re also helping yourself to keep fit, youthful and healthy.<br /><br />Healthy Lungs<br /><br />Singing can have a dramatic impact on your lungs and breathing. The physical effort required to sing can improve lung capacity. Singers learn to use deep breathing and build up strong muscles in the torso and abdomen. The various benefits of good breathing include better posture and improved mental alertness. It can also help you relax and sleep better. The breathing techniques learned through singing can help you stay calm too. The increased oxygen in the body helps in many ways.<br /><br />Good Exercise<br /><br />It’s been said that classical singing produces the same effect as doing pilates. The effort required to project the voice works the core muscles of the body and this intense physical effort can often result in weight loss as well. When you sing, you’re having a light aerobic workout and losing calories!<br /><br />Singing Keeps You Young<br /><br />Singing helps keep us looking and feeling young as it gently exercises the muscles in your face. Did you know that working these muscles helps reduce the onset of wrinkles? You can forget those expensive anti-ageing creams. Studies have found that the population of Newhaven, Connecticut, had increased their life expectancy through choral singing. The researchers believed this was because singing promoted a healthy heart and an improved mental state.<br /><br />Sing Away The Blues<br /><br />We often sing when we're happy, but singing when we feel down, may be an even better idea. Singing causes the brain to produce hormones called endorphins which rush around body. It has the same effect as when you eat a bar of chocolate. Of course, the good news is that when you sing, you don’t gain weight. In fact, you may lose some!<br /><br />So next time you sing along to the radio, remember you're not just having fun, you're doing yourself a whole lot of good too. Next time you're feeling a bit down in the dumps just sing!<br /><br />Questions:<br />1.(a)What's your favorite song?  No matter which language it is and no matter how old it is, please tell us the reason why.<br />    (b)What kind of music / song is your last option to listen?　Why?<br />2. Do you prefer singing in  karaoke room with friends ,singing alone, singing under the shower or other option?<br />3. Which KTV is your first choice?　What standard do you consider before you go into the KTV?</div>
