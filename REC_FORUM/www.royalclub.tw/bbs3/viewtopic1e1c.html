			<div class="content">Session I<br />The world's first family to live in a 3D-printed home, by Michael Cowan BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme,6 July 2018<br /><br />A family in France has become the first in the world to move into a 3D-printed house. The four-bedroom property is a prototype for bigger projects aiming to make housebuilding quicker and cheaper. Could it cause a shift in the building industry? With curved walls designed to reduce the effects of humidity and digital controls for disabled people, this house could be an expensive realisation of an architect's vision. But having taken 54 hours to print - with four more months for contractors to add in things such as windows, doors and the roof - its cost of around £176,000 to build makes it 20% cheaper than an identical construction using more traditional solutions. The team now believe they could print the same house again in only 33 hours. The 95m (1022ft) square house - built for a family of five with four bedrooms and a big central space in Nantes - is a collaboration between the city council, a housing association and University of Nantes. Francky Trichet, the council's lead on technology and innovation, says the purpose of the project was to see whether this type of construction could become mainstream for housing, and whether its principles could be applied to other communal buildings, such as sports halls. He be &quot;For 2,000 years there hasn't been a change in the paradigm of the construction process. We wanted to sweep this whole construction process away,&quot; he says. &quot;That's why I'm saying that we're at the start of a story. We've just written, 'Once upon a time'. &quot;Now, he says, their work will &quot;force&quot; private companies to &quot;take the pen&quot; and continue the narrative. the process will disrupt the construction industry. The house has been built in a deprived neighbourhood in the north of the town and was partly funded by the council. Nordine and Nouria Ramdani, along with their three children, were the lucky ones chosen to live there. &quot;It's a big honour to be a part of this project,&quot; says Nordine.&quot;We lived in a block of council flats from the 60s, so it's a big change for us. &quot;It's really something amazing to be able to live in a place where there is a garden, and to have a detached house.&quot;<br />How does it work?<br />The house is designed in a studio by a team of architects and scientists, then programmed into a 3D printer. The printer is then brought to the site of the home. It works by printing in layers from the floor upwards. Each wall consists of two layers of the insulator polyurethane, with a space in-between which is filled with cement. This creates a thick, insulated, fully-durable wall. The windows, doors, and roof are then fitted. And, voila, you have a home. The house was the brainchild of Benoit Furet, who heads up the project at University of Nantes. He thinks that in five years they will reduce the cost of the construction of such houses by 25% while adhering to building regulations, and by 40% in 10 to 15 years. This is partly because of the technology becoming more refined and cheaper to develop and partly because of economies of scale as more houses are built. Printing, he adds, also allows architects to be far more creative with the shapes of the houses they are building. For example, the house in Nantes was built to curve around the 100-year-old protected trees on the plot. The curve also improves the home's air circulation, reducing potential humidity and improving thermal resistance. The building in Nantes was also designed for disabled people, with wheelchair access and the ability for everything to be controlled from a smartphone. It is also more environmentally-friendly than traditional construction, as there is no waste .Mr Furet's dream is now to create a suburban neighbourhood with the same building principles. He says he is currently working on a project in the north of Paris to print 18 houses. He is also working on a large commercial building which will measure 700 metres square, he adds. &quot;Social housing is something that touches me personally,&quot; Mr Furet says. &quot;I was born in a working-class town. &quot;I lived in a little house. My parents - who are very old now - still live in the same house. &quot;The street is a row of little houses, one next to the other, all identical. &quot;And here I wanted to create a house that is social housing, but with much more modern architecture.&quot; <br /><br />Discussion:<br />1.	3D – printed house is 20% cheaper than the traditional house. Could it become the mainstream for housing?<br />2.	Due to the technology more refined and cheaper, the consumers have more variety choice for the house in the future. Would you like to buy a 3D-printed house?<br />3.	Since 3D printed house is easily and quickly to build, it will be benefit for the devastated areas and the low income people. Do you think it will solve the social housing problems for them?     <br />4.	Since 3D printed is a new technology, would you like to join the class to learn it?<br /><br /><br />Session II<br />I Am (an Older) Woman. Hear Me Roar. <br />From CBS’s Susan Zirinsky to Glenn Close, many women of a certain age are having a moment.By Jessica Bennett,Jan. 8, 2019<br />When Susan Zirinsky takes over CBS News in March, she will be the first woman to hold the job. She will also be the oldest person to assume the role, at 66. Her appointment was announced just days after Nancy Pelosi, 78, was re-elected Speaker of the House of Representatives — making her the most powerful elected woman in United States history — and Representative Maxine Waters became the first woman and African-American to lead the Financial Services Committee, at age 79.News of Ms. Zirinsky’s ascension broke on the same evening that 71-year-old Glenn Close bested four younger women to win the Golden Globe for best actress. It seems that older women, long invisible or shunted aside, are experiencing an unfamiliar sensation: power. There are more women over 50 in this country today than at any other point in history, according to data from the United States Census Bureau. Those women are healthier, working longer, and have more income than previous generations. That is creating modest but real progress in their visibility and stature. “Age — don’t worry about it — it’s a state of mind,” Ms. Zirinsky said on Tuesday when asked about the effect of her age on her new job. “I have so much energy that my staff did an intervention when I tried a Red Bull. ”Men, of course, have led major organizations well into their seventh and even eighth decades, retaining their power and prominence. But the #MeToo movement has toppled some high-profile males, from 77-year-old Charlie Rose to Les Moonves, 69, who was ousted as head of CBS after multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, creating unexpected openings for the elevation of women.And Susan Douglas, a professor of communication studies at the University of Michigan who is writing a book on the power of older women, said “a demographic revolution” was occurring — both in the number of women who are working into their 60s and 70s and in the perception, in the wake of #MeToo, of their expertise and value. Older women are now saying ‘No, I’m still vibrant, I still have a lot to offer, and I’m not going to be consigned to invisibility,” she said. “These women are reinventing what it means to be an older woman.” <br />In 2016, the average life span of women in the United States was 81.1, compared to men’s 76.1. Nearly a third of women aged 65 to 69 are now working, up from 15 percent in the late 1980s, according to recent analyses by the Harvard economists Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz. Some 18 percent of women aged 70 to 74 work, up from 8 percent. nterestingly, working longer is more common among women with higher education and savings — while those who are not working are more likely to have poor health and low savings and to be dependent on Social Security. I can assure you I did not like — in fact I flinched — when The Times wrote about my new company, and there it was in black and white, ‘Christiane Amanpour, 60,’” said Christiane Amanpour, who replaced Mr. Rose on PBS last year and turns 61 this week. “But then I thought, No, this is cool!— I’m 60 and a whole other chapter of my life is opening.’ Despite the excitement, it is still rare to find women in their 60s leading major institutions or taking center stage in other industries. n cinema, for example, a 2017 study from the University of Southern California found that just 2.6 percent of the speaking roles in 25 films nominated for best picture were women older than 60 — and those women were far less likely to be depicted in powerful jobs. “I think this notion of who can lead and who can’t is being completely upended,” said Katie Couric, the longtime news anchor, who celebrated her 62nd birthday this week. “So to see someone like Glenn Close give the most moving speech of the night, and her experience and wisdom respected, or when you see Susan Zirinsky be elevated, I say ‘Bring it on, let’s have more of this.’”<br /><br />Discussion:<br />1.	Do you think that the age is only a number? Does the age mean the wisdom?<br />2.	Men have led the society over the past decades. Do you think that the women can lead the society in the   next decade?<br />3.	It has been long saying in ancient China that the woman who has no ability owns the virtue. Do you agree with the concept?<br />4.	Do you think that ages can accumulate experiences and wisdom? Would it be possible that the age women in Taiwan can get the job, like western countries? <br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />8:10 ~ 8:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:25 ~ 8:30pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:30 ~9:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~9:30pm Concluding remarks/feedback from newcomers<br /><br />The meeting place of Thursday:<br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第一區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
