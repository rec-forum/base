11/9(Sat.)Medical dispute&amp;Three weeks for night owls to change their routines(Host: Shuman)<br />Medical dispute resolution, patient safety and the doctor-patient relationship<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5917052/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5917052/</a><!-- m --> <br /><br />PATIENT AUTONOMY<br />The vast majority of medical disputes arise out of medical negligence. The plaintiff must prove that the defendant owed a duty of care, breached that duty and caused damage that is not too remote. However, each of these aspects of negligence becomes more complex in medical malpractice suits. To whom is the duty owed? Is it to the patient, the unborn child, the spouse, the employer, the parents, or the stranger in distress? What is the scope of that duty? Is it to prevent physical injury, psychological harm, emotional distress, pure economic loss, expectations loss, loss of chance, or loss of autonomy?<br />How is the standard of care to be determined? The relationship between doctor and patient is not like the relationship between pedestrian and motorist. There is a prior relationship of trust, vulnerability and expectation. The medical choices are infinite and doctors have to take into account not just the patients’ emotions, idiosyncrasies and autonomy, but also the institutional culture of the medical services provider<br /> as well as the practices and policies of insurers and managed care systems. Causation in medical negligence is especially complex. The trial process, which is adversarial, bound by strict rules of evidence and usually takes place years after the event, is not the best mechanism to determine liability, let alone understand what actually happened.<br />Question<br />1.Have you ever met Misdiagnosis? When did you find it?<br />2.Have you or your friends ever met medical dispute?  <br />3.Do you believe the famous doctors are equal the good skill? Why?<br />4.Do you think the doctor is a high risk job? Why? <br /><br /><br />Study: Three weeks for night owls to change their routines<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/lang/archives/2019/09/09/2003721941">http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/lang/ar ... 2003721941</a><!-- m --> <br /><br />Many people have irregular daily routines, or are night owls who go to bed late and get up late, causing them to perform poorly at work or in class during the daytime. According to a study published in Sleep Medicine Research last month, the use of interventions to adjust people’s sleep routines and correct their displaced sleep schedule required a period of three weeks.<br />The study included 22 young people aged between 18 and 24 years old, the participants being “night owls” that would usually go to sleep around 02:30am and get up at around 10:30am.<br />The participants were randomly divided into a test group and a control group. For three weeks, those in the test group were asked to modify their routines, including the time they got up and went to bed, their diet and their exercise. This included waking up two or three hours earlier than they would normally do, exercising outdoors in plenty of sunshine as much as possible, eating breakfast as soon as they got up and eating meals at regular times. It also meant not drinking caffeinated drinks after 3pm, eating their evening meal before 7pm and, for those who did exercise, to shift their exercise time to the morning. They were also asked to go to bed two to three hours earlier than they were used to and to reduce their exposure to light in the evening.<br />The only stipulation placed on those in the control group was that they eat lunch at set times every day.<br />The findings showed that establishing simple routines could help night owls adjust their biological clock and improve their overall physical and mental health. They also experienced reduced levels of depression and stress and would feel less drowsy during the day.<br />The study findings were consistent with past research, that sleep in humans was affected by the biological clock, and that the biological clock was tied to sunlight.<br />Therefore, if you want to get your routine back into order you should start with your exposure to sunlight: try going to bed an hour earlier, go out and eat breakfast in the morning, avoid lying down on the bed during the daytime, and exercise more outdoors in the sunshine. If you really feel the need to sleep, do your best to restrict it to a half hour lunchtime nap, and don’t eat too much for dinner. If you continue in this way for 3 to 5 days according to your requirements, your body clock will gradually return to a more normal routine.<br /><br />Question<br />1.How can you change my bad habits quickly? <br />2.How can you change old habits? <br />3.What kind of habits you want to change it? <br /><br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00 ~ 7:30 pm greetings &amp; free talk<br />7:30 ~ 8:15 pm guests introduced &amp; first session discussion<br />8:15 ~ 8:45 pm presentation, sharing the article &amp; other experiences<br />8:45 ~ 9:30 pm second session discussion<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven,<br />板橋民生路二段237 號,<br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30,<br />a minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=872">Shuman</a> — Sun Nov 03, 2019 7:27 am</p><hr />
