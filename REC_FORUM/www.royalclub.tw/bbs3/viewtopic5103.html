			<div class="content">12 Best Cruises for First Timers<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cruisecritic.com/articles.cfm?ID=129">http://www.cruisecritic.com/articles.cfm?ID=129</a><!-- m --><br />By Elissa Garay, Cruise Critic Contributor<br /><br />Planning your first cruise can feel like an overwhelming undertaking. There are indeed so many choices, from &quot;party boats&quot; in the Caribbean and luxury yachts in the Mediterranean to river cruises in Asia and expedition ships in Antarctica. You need to put some careful thought into just what kind of traveler you are (Foodie? Adventurer? Night owl?) and which type of cruise vacation you really want, while also factoring in such practicalities as budget, the departure port and the length of the trip.<br />So how do you figure out if a cruise line's personality is compatible with your needs? You could ask a travel agent -- or simply read through our handy shortlist of the very best cruise lines for first-timers.<br /><br />1. Carnival Cruise Line<br />Best for: Value hunters<br />Why: Carnival is the line for &quot;everycruiser,&quot; appealing to a broad spectrum of vacationers who share one common trait: They all want a super-fun escape without going bankrupt. The combination of Carnival's sizable fleet (25 ships), emphasis on popular destinations (Caribbean, Bahamas and Mexico) and dedication to accessible three- to seven-night itineraries translates to low prices and frequent deals. Cruises typically start around a reasonable $80 per person, per night, and can be nabbed for lower still with promotional fares. Carnival keeps its cabins simple, with plenty of standard insides and outsides, and does not go overboard with fee-extra venues onboard (access to specialty dining venues like Guy's Burger Joint, Serenity adults-only retreats and Punchliner Comedy Club shows, for instance, are all free of charge). For the best budget rates, avoid holiday periods (especially school vacations).<br /><br />2. Regent Seven Seas Cruises<br />Best for: Luxury seekers<br />Why: Regent Seven Seas is arguably the most inclusive of the biggest luxury brands. Its fares include all-suite accommodations (98 percent come with balconies), meals in main and specialty dining venues, pre- and post-cruise tours and hotel stays, gratuities, shore excursions and beverages from liquor to sodas (in your suite, at dinner or in the ships' public areas). The ships are on the larger size for luxury, carrying 490 to 750 passengers each -- small enough to create a social onboard atmosphere without the crowds of a big ship, but large enough to offer spacious cabins (the smallest is 301 square feet) and enough dining and entertainment venues to prevent boredom. Luxury touches abound, whether it be a butler in your penthouse suite or exclusive premium bath amenities designed by the L'Occitane line. The 750-passenger Seven Seas Explorer has over-the-top suites and the highest staff-to-passenger ratios in the industry. Wherever in the world you choose to sail, you will be truly pampered.<br /><br />3. Royal Caribbean International<br />Best for: Families with tweens or teens<br />Why: Older kids need distractions and special attention; Royal Caribbean gives them both. Depending on the ship, the line taps into teens' and tweens' bottomless well of energy with rock climbing walls, ziplines, ice and inline skating, surf and skydiving simulators, water slides and basketball and volleyball courts. For its youth programs, Royal Caribbean wisely splits up tweens and teens into their appropriate age groups. It also treats the underage crowd like mini-adults with such sophisticated amenities as spa treatments designed especially for the primping generation and their adolescent needs; DJ lessons; teens-only casino nights; backstage tours of the ship; and no-elders-allowed lounges where they can dance, drink mocktails and socialize with their new pals until past their parents' bedtimes. The packed schedule, overseen by an attentive crew, lets parents enjoy their own downtime without worrying about their charges growing bored and antsy.<br /><br />4. Disney Cruise Line<br />Best for: Families with small children<br />Why: Disney really gets what parents and small children need on vacation, from entertainment and dining to childcare. The line is rare in the industry for attending to the needs of babies and toddlers; it provides nurseries for little sailors up to 3 years old and has a water-play area available to the diapered set. The cruise line also fills its ships with its signature characters, such as Mickey, Goofy, Cinderella and her princess pals, who engage youngsters at planned events and spontaneous encounters. Its expansive play areas are themed after popular Disney, Pixar, Star Wars and Marvel movies, with plenty of high-tech games and interactive (and often educational) programming. Cabins and dining establishments are tailored for families, taking into account the practical (split bathrooms with tub/shower combos) and the whimsical (restaurants with fairytale decor).<br /><br />5. Silversea Cruises<br />Best for: Mature cruisers<br />Why: Upscale Silversea attracts a dedicated following of mature travelers (in fact, it's a rarity to find a child onboard). Its all-inclusive pricing model allows for a luxury experience without lots of unexpected expense, with Silversea inclusions like room service, wine and spirits, gratuities and transportation into town from port all bundled into the upfront fares. The line's nine small ships -- accommodating just 100 to 596 guests -- are well-suited to guests seeking easy camaraderie, as well as for those with limited mobility. Plus, Silversea's itineraries propose access to more off-the-beaten-track worldwide ports (they sail to 800-plus locales across all seven continents) that hold special appeal for seasoned travelers looking for new horizons to explore.<br /><br />6. Holland America Line<br />Best for: Singles<br />Why: Holland America Line caters to solo travelers via its Single Partners Program, which includes hosted parties for onboard singles (early on in the cruise), followed up by special singles-themed cocktail parties and games that give solo cruisers plenty of time to connect. The line will also group singles together for dining (on request), and on sailings of 40 days or longer, even provides special gentlemen hosts to accompany single women to dinner or on the dance floor. HAL facilitates a roommate matching service with fellow solo travelers of the same sex; if the line can't find a suitable partner for participants, it will still guarantee them a double occupancy fare. Alternatively, two Holland America ships offer dedicated single cabins: Koningsdam has 12, and Prinsendam has three.<br /><br />7. Oceania Cruises<br />Best for: Foodies<br />Why: The fact that Oceania has famous French chef Jacques Pepin as its executive culinary director speaks volumes about its dedication to fine onboard dining. The main dining rooms offer high-quality fare in an open-seating plan, and even the buffets and poolside grill fare refuse to disappoint. Lobsters come sourced from the line's own Maine lobster farm, and its beef is dry-aged for 28 days in Oceania's aging facility. Specialty venues are all fee-free (minus special wine-pairing menus), and range from the Asian-style Red Ginger to Italian Toscana and French bistro Jacques. And if eating mouth-watering cuisine isn't enough, you can learn to prepare it yourself with classes in the Culinary Center. Look out, too, for the line's expanded portfolio of Culinary Discovery Tours, dedicated foodie-friendly shore excursions on offer in ports like Casablanca, Rio and Venice.<br /><br />8. Norwegian Cruise Line<br />Best for: Entertainment enthusiasts<br />Why: All Norwegian ships offer musical revues, comedy and improv shows, live music and guest performers, but the line really shines with its newest ships: Norwegian Escape, Norwegian Epic, Norwegian Breakaway and Norwegian Getaway. The line takes its inspiration from land-based hits, and cruisers can experience Broadway musicals like &quot;Rock of Ages,&quot; &quot;After Midnight&quot; or &quot;Million Dollar Quartet&quot;; sizzling dance shows like &quot;Burn the Floor&quot;; comedy by Second City improv or Levity Comedy; and music by dueling pianists and blues bands. The line even turns meals into theater with dinner show Cirque Dreams. Throw in plenty of bars, discos, bowling and Wii, and you will never be bored onboard.<br /><br />9. Cunard Line<br />Best for: Enrichment seekers<br />Why: Cunard and its trio of Queens ooze culture like an Oxford don. The cruise line introduced the Cunard Insights enrichment program in 2007, inviting onboard such luminaries as a NASA astronaut, a polar explorer and British wit John Cleese. In 2016, the Insights program partnered with The New York Times to present a speaker series highlighting experts on journalism, climate change, politics, national security, sports and more. Passengers can also indulge in cultural pursuits with ballroom dancing, West End-style theater (in a box seat, no less), a planetarium (on Queen Mary 2 only) and string quartets that bid the sun adieu. Audience participation is encouraged; you can learn the art of acting with Royal Academy of Dramatic Art members and wax poetic in onboard book clubs. Starting in 2018, passengers will have the opportunity to trace their family tree, too, under the tutelage of experts from Ancestry.com.<br /><br />10. Lindblad Expeditions<br />Best for: Adventurers<br />Why: Lindblad seeks out exotic itineraries in the Arctic, Antarctica, Galapagos, Amazon and other less-mainstream cruise destinations. On its polar voyages, passengers sail aboard an ice-class vessel that easily slips through frozen passageways populated with polar bears in the Arctic or penguins in Antarctica. Its Torres del Paine-to-Cape Horn itinerary delivers myriad land-and-sea encounters in Patagonia's vast wilderness. On all voyages, passengers can expect to share in the expertise of a team of naturalists, including National Geographic photographers (or Lindblad-National Geographic certified photo instructors) and undersea specialists, providing a steady stream of eco-insights and information. For closer views, the cruise line equips its ships with Zodiacs, sea kayaks and underwater cameras. Shore excursions trade bus tours for educational and active diversions, such as naturalist-led glacier hikes and deep-water snorkeling. The company also advances sustainable practices and supports many conservation programs in the fragile destinations it visits.<br /><br />11. Paul Gauguin Cruises<br />Best for: Romantics<br />Why: Paul Gauguin Cruises offers a singular experience in the ultimate honeymoon/anniversary/special-occasion destinations of French Polynesia and the greater South Pacific. Its namesake ship doesn't skimp on romance: All cabins boast ocean views, and a majority has queen-sized beds and private balconies. Couples can feel the ooh-la-la over a Polynesian-accented French meal at the fine-dining restaurant L'Etoile, or during a private sunset dinner served on their stateroom balcony. The spa caters to twosomes with couples' treatments -- try the 40-minute aroma steam bath for two or a massage on a private islet off the coast of Taha'a. Plus, the line offers a complimentary package for honeymooners (with thoughtful touches like in-room Champagne and a special Polynesian blessing ceremony), as well as a selection of wedding and vow renewal ceremony packages.<br /><br />12. Viking River Cruises<br />Best for: River cruisers<br />Why: Viking River Cruises, celebrating 20 years in 2017, is a seasoned player that caters to first-time cruisers looking to get their feet wet in the world of river cruising. Known for its expansive portfolio of immersive, destination-centric itineraries -- including iconic European offerings like the Romantic Danube, Rhine Getaway and Grand European Tour -- the line has a river sailing to suit all tastes, with more than 60 vessels plying the inland waterways of Europe, Russia, Asia and Egypt. Viking's fleet is mainly composed of its signature 190-passenger Viking Longship vessels, and passengers can expect modern Scandinavian design elements onboard with plenty of panoramic windows, oversized suites and the indoor/outdoor Aquavit Terrace, set at each ship's bow. Plus, with largely inclusive pricing (rates include a shore excursion in every port and beer and wine with meals), first-time cruisers needn't fret about racking up lots of incidentals, a common caveat encountered on mainstream oceangoing cruises.<br /><br />DISCUSSION:<br />Q1:  Have you heard about Cruise lines in Taiwan?<br />Q2:  Are you interested in Cruise vacation?<br />Q3:  Which Cruise line above is your favorite?<br />Q4:  Will you try it for your honeymoon?<br /><br />=========================================================================================<br />TABLE MANNERS<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.etiquettescholar.com/dining_etiquette/table_manners.html">https://www.etiquettescholar.com/dining ... nners.html</a><!-- m --><br /> At informal meals, place the napkin in your lap immediately upon seating. During formal occasions, before unfolding the napkin, wait for the hostess to remove her napkin from the table and unfold it in her lap.<br />1.	Place the napkin in your lap upon seating.<br />2.	When leaving the table temporarily, put the napkin on your chair.<br />3.	At the meal's end, fold your napkin and place it to the left of your place setting<br /><br />HANDLING UTENSILS<br />How do you hold a fork?<br />The continental style prevails at all meals, formal and informal, because it is a natural, non-disruptive way to eat.<br />1.	Hold your fork in your left hand, tines downward.<br />2.	Hold your knife in your right hand, an inch or two above the plate.<br />3.	Extend your index finger along the top of the blade.<br />4.	Use your fork to spear and lift food to your mouth.<br />At informal meals the dinner fork may be held tines upward, American table manners style.<br /><br />THE TABLE SETTING<br />Deciding which knife, fork, or spoon to use is made easier by the outside-in rule – use utensils on the outside first and working your way inward. So, if you are served a salad first, use the fork set to the far left of your plate.<br />Your water glass is the one above the knife in your place setting and your bread plate is to the left. To remember which bread plate belongs to you and if the glass in front of you belongs to you or your neighbor, use “b” and “d”. Touch the index finger on your right hand to your right thumb. Touch the index finger on your left hand to your left thumb. The “b” formed by your left hand is for “bread” (your bread plate is always at the left of your place setting). The “d” formed by your right hand is for “drink” (your drinking glasses are always at the right of your place setting).<br />Our table setting section discusses in greater detail what you'll see at the table.<br /><br />WHEN TO START EATING<br />At a small table of only two to four people, wait until everyone else has been served before starting to eat. At a formal or business meal, you should either wait until everyone is served to start or begin when the host asks you to.<br />RESTING UTENSILS<br />How do you leave your knife and fork on your plate when taking a break or are finished eating?<br />When you pause to take a sip of your beverage or to speak with someone, rest your utensils in one of the two following styles:<br />Continental Style: Place your knife and fork on your plate near the center, slightly angled in an inverted V and with the tips of the knife and fork pointing toward each other.<br />American Style: Rest your knife on the top right of your plate (diagonally) with the fork nearby (tines up).<br />When each course is finished:<br />Place the knife and fork parallel with the handles in the four o'clock position on the right rim of the plate.<br />PASSING FOOD ETIQUETTE<br />Pass to the right (if the item is not being passed to a specific person). One diner either holds the dish as the next diner takes some food, or he hands it to the person, who then serves herself. Any heavy or awkward dishes are put on the table with each pass.<br />BREAD PASSING ETIQUETTE<br />1.	If the loaf is not cut, cut a few pieces, offer them to the person to your left, and then pass the basket to your right.<br />2.	Do not touch the loaf with your fingers, instead use the clothe in the bread basket as a buffer to steady the bread as you slice it.<br />3.	Place the bread and butter on your butter plate - yours is on your left - then break off a bite sized piece of bread, put a little butter on it, and eat it.<br />SALT AND PEPPER ETIQUETTE<br />Always pass the salt and pepper together.<br />FOOD SERVICE ETIQUETTE<br />During service of a formal dinner, the food is brought to each diner at the table; the server presents the platter or bowl on the diner's left. At a more casual meal, either the host dishes the food onto guests' plates for them to pass around the table or the diners help themselves to the food and pass it to others as necessary.<br />MEALS END<br />At a formal affair, plates are removed by a professional staff. But as most informal meals are served without help, the hostess clears the plates, often with the help of a guest or two. At a family meal, members clear their own plates.<br />CLEARING THE PLATES<br />If the meal is formal, plates will be removed by the staff. <br />At informal meals, the hostess will probably clear the plates, possibly with one or two guests helping.<br />At a family meal, members clear their own plates.<br /><br />Leaving the dining room. To signal dinner is concluded, the hostess catches the eye of the host, lays her napkin on the table, and suggests that everyone go into another room for coffee and after-dinner drinks. The hostess rises from her chair.<br />When it's time to leave, rather than detain one's host with a lengthy good-bye, make the departure brief but cordial.<br /><br />DISCUSSION:<br />Q1:  Have you eaten meals like this manner&gt;<br />Q2:  Do you have any table manner of family?<br />Q3:  What are our table manners in Taiwan?<br />Q4:  Do you know any table manners in other countries?</div>
