<span style="font-weight: bold">Sexual harassment: How it stands around the globe</span><br /><br />(CNN)Any woman, in any country, will most likely be able to relate to this situation:<br />Walking down the street, alone, past a group of guys hanging out with nowhere to go. Her guard goes up, and preparation takes place. Many things could happen when she passes them.<br /><br />It may be the words &quot;hey, beautiful&quot; or &quot;hey, sexy,&quot; or being instructed to smile. It may be more intentional: standing in the way or blocking the path in hope of some interaction. It may get more aggressive, with hands reaching to inappropriate places.<br /><br />The spectrum is far and wide, with one end harboring the potential for things to become more violent with physical abuse or rape.<br />Rape is an extreme consequence of sexual harassment,&quot; said Rachel Jewkes, director of the What Works to Prevent Violence Against Women and Girls global program. But there are a &quot;myriad of behaviors,&quot; she said.<br /><br />The fact is that sexual harassment is part and parcel of daily life, particularly in public places, Jewkes believes. &quot;It's used to curtail a woman's freedom.&quot;<br /><br />In the streets of London, Mumbai, Washington or Lagos, the recent outpouring of stories from women using #MeToo and its many iterations has showed the uniformity of the problem -- irrespective of country and culture.<br />In 2017, the world has made one thing clear: Sexual harassment is everywhere.<br /><br />When quantifying the problem on a global level, minimal levels of reporting and data limit what experts can provide to help prove -- and solve -- the problem. Based on what is available, here's how the numbers look globally.<br /><br />DISCUSSION : <br />1.Please define what is Sexual harassment?<br />2.Do you hear any sexual harassment information in our life?<br />3.If you face some kind sexual harassment situation,how will you do?<br /><br />==============================================================================================================<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Davis Cup: France edges Belgium 3-2 to win trophy for 10th time</span><br /><br />(CNN)Lucas Pouille proved the hero for France as it beat Belgium 3-2 to win the Davis Cup for the 10th time before a raucous home crowd at the Stade Pierre Mauroy in Lille Sunday.<br /><br />Pouille thrashed Steve Darcis 6-3 6-1 6-0 in the fifth and deciding rubber to see France lift the famous trophy for <br />Earlier, ATP World Tour Finals runner-up David Goffin dominated French No.1 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga with another straight sets victory to tie the final at two rubbers apiece.<br /><br />But Belgium hopes quickly disappeared as a below-par Darcis could not muster a serious challenge to Pouille, who was engulfed by teammates after rushing through the final set without dropping a game.&quot;This is a feeling from another world,&quot; world number 18 Pouille said. &quot;There are no words needed, just look at the atmosphere and hear the emotion.<br />&quot;I am so proud of my team, we really wanted this trophy. After 16 years, we finally got it, I'm very happy.&quot; The 23-year-old Pouille had showed no signs of nerves after the earlier French setback, breaking Darcis on his first service game to take the opener and three more times in the second set, the Belgian unable to repeat the sort of form that saw him shock Rafael Nadal in the first round at Wimbledon four years ago.<br /><br />The third set was even more one-sided as France ended that frustrating 16-year wait, with defeats in the 2002, 2010 and 2014 finals, to win the annual competition for national teams.<br /><br />A decisive doubles victory Saturday for Richard Gasquet and Pierre-Hugues Herbert had put France firmly in the driving seat, but the impeccable Goffin revived Belgian hopes with a two-hour 44 minute victory over world number 15 Tsonga.<br /><br />After taking a 74-minute opening set on a tiebreak, Goffin took command to run out a 7-6 6-3 6-2 victory to set up the decider, but his heroic efforts proved to no avail although he will reflect on a season which has lifted him to seventh in the world rankings with promise of more success in the future.<br /><br />Discussion :<br />1.Do you know what is Davis Cup?<br />2.Do you know who is champion King and Queen?<br />3.Do you know how old is tennis player average life ?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">dora</a> — Thu Nov 30, 2017 12:38 am</p><hr />
