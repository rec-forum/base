				<div class="content"><span style="color: #FF0080">Place: 丹堤咖啡, 台北市延平南路107號2樓 (MRT 西門站4號出口)<br />Agenda:<br />07:00-7:05 pm Opening Remarks<br />07:05-7:40 pm Session 1 Group Discussion<br />07:40-8:00 pm Presentation (At least two members of each table are invited, 2 mins / each member)<br />8:00-8:05 pm Break<br />8:05-8:40 pm Session 2 discussion<br />8:40-9:00 pm Presentation<br /></span><br /><br />Session 1<br />English Vs. Mandarin<br />Questions:<br />Q1. Which language is more difficult to learn/ teach?<br />Q2.  English is the dominant language now, what language is qualified to be the language of the future?<br />Q3. Please compare the pros and cons between traditional Chinese and simplified Chinese.<br />Q4. There're 3 kinds of English: American English , British English and Australian English. Which one is your last choice to learn? Why?<br /><br /><br />Session 2<br />An Outing Diary<br /><br />April  24, 2021            Saturday               Sunny<br />This morning I went to 鶯歌by MRT and train. Because it’s the 1st time for me to ride a train to 鶯歌, I missed the train that Royal English club members planned to get . Fortunately, I asked a kind and right person to get the correct shuttle train at right side and right time. Louie asked 4 late persons- I’m included to add his WECHAT but I don’t register WECHAT. He said he could find us after we went off the train because WECHAT offers an instant position option.<br />But I don’t know about WECHAT, I posted a photo to line to confirm which car I am at. Luckily Crystal found me . What a relief!<br /><br /><br />After we got off the train, I followed Crystal to move  towards the English tour guide- Mike. He said he’ll introduce us the area  by English as much as possible but still use some Chinese to explain some difficult terminologies. <br />We are a group of English maniacs! Last year during the pandemic we  used zoom meeting to practice English. Today we practiced English all the way. Look at group pictures, some are over 70 years old. “ it’s never too late to learn.”They're good models for us to learn.<br /><br /><br />鶯歌was named after “ parrot “ because parrot was pronounced to 鸚哥in Taiwanese. There’s a huge stone in 鶯歌whose shape looks like a parrot. When 鄭成功’s troops passed by the stone, they got sick because of miasma around the stone. 鄭成功ordered his soldiers fired the stone by cannon to break its neck, so only the parrot’s body left to now.<br />鶯歌 is famous for its ceramics. We visited many stores concerning chinaware and pottery. We also saw an iconic symbol- parrot statue standing in there. There are some ruins of tunnel kilns existing but the guide said they are more likely to be<br />demolished soon. Hence we can be the last group to witness their existences. Then I thought of 福島 in Japan, if you had sightseed福島, you would have felt lucky after earthquake and tsunami destroyed 福島.<br /> People reach some age, we begin to miss those happy times. Nostalgia feeling comes like a long-lost friend. I found it in the movie, in the novel, or even an old photo.<br /><br /><br />An old building is standing in my memory. The old diary comes alive when I open it. My past handwriting, yellowing paper, and moldy smell are reminding me: contents could bring me back decades ago to seek the old building.<br /> Questions for discussion:<br />1. Did you keep a diary/ an e-diary? If yes, how did you keep one? If no, what are your reasons?<br />2. Everyone perceived the outing from different angles. Please share your feelings with us.<br />3. Did you ever open your past diaries to review/ seek the sweet/ unforgettable moment?<br /><br /><br /><br />P.S.<br />1.因聚會地點是在咖啡店內，所以有低消80元喔。<br />2.參加三次後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />3.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~</div>
