			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Session I: Yale's most popular class teaches happiness: 6 lessons you can practice now</span><br />by A. Pawlowski / Feb.19.2018 / 9:26 PM ET / Source: TODAY<br /><a href="https://www.today.com/health/yale-popular-happiness-class-6-lessons-you-can-practice-now-t123226" class="postlink">https://www.today.com/health/yale-popular-happiness-class-6-lessons-you-can-practice-now-t123226</a><br /><br />When Yale University psychology professor Laurie Santos set out to teach a new course on how to be happy, the reaction was stunning.<br /><br />“Psychology and the Good Life,” which began this semester, is the most popular class in the history of Yale College, with more than 1,200 students enrolled, the Yale Daily News reported. One classroom wasn’t enough, so the lectures are now being simulcast around campus.<br /><br />And now, the class will be available to anyone with an internet connection — for free. Online-education provider Coursera has teamed up with the Ivy League university to offer the entire course, including graded assignments, online starting in March. You can register here.<br /><br />No one is more surprised by the course's popularity than Santos, who started the class to help students navigate stress, depression and other mental health challenges. But it’s not just young people who are looking for answers. The course hit a nerve well beyond Yale, with media clamoring to interview Santos about her lessons.<br /><br />“Adults really are thinking about the things they can do to live a better life and become a bit happier,” Santos told TODAY.<br /><br />“There’s a good answer for how to do this in the science of psychology. We know a lot about the kinds of things that really make us happy and stuff that doesn’t.”<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Here are six of her happiness lessons:</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">1. Spend time and energy in the right way</span><br /><br />We tend to strive for certain things we think will make us happy — a job with a big salary or perfect grades — when in practice, we don’t enjoy them as much as we think, Santos said.<br />We also spend hours on Facebook or Twitter, even though research suggests being on social media is associated with depression and anxiety, she added.<br />Overscheduled, distracted and glued to our screens, we’re missing out on things that do make us happy: real-life, face-to-face social connections with people you can see blush, smile and wink; and “time affluence” — just having free time, with nothing on the calendar to get in the way of your leisure.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">2. Take time to express gratitude</span><br /><br />Pausing for 10 minutes a day to think about five things you’re grateful for can increase your appreciation of what matters and improve your well-being, Santos said.<br />“The big key is that when you do it, it can’t just be rote. It can’t just be, ‘My house, my spouse, my kids’ every day,” she noted. “You have to take time to feel it… it’s a moment to really reflect on, ‘What would my life be like without this thing?’”<br />Usually, the gifts in your life come from someone you're thankful for, so really think about people who helped you.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">3. Do something nice for somebody else and talk with others</span><br /><br />People who engage in random acts of kindness boost their well-being. That includes small gestures and bigger ones, like donating money to charity.<br />One of Santos’ favorite studies found people who spent money on others reported greater happiness, with such generosity bestowing a “warm glow” on the givers.<br />Another favorite study discovered that a simple act of connecting with a stranger — talking to somebody on a train or a plane, for example — can boost your mood. We underestimate other people’s interest in connecting, but such simple exchanges can be happy for everyone involved, researchers said.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">4. Find some time to be mindful</span><br /><br />Meditate for five or 10 minutes a day to increase well-being. You can go for any type of meditation you like — just schedule the time, sit down in a quiet spot, close your eyes and be in the present moment.<br />Santos likes to do a loving kindness meditation. She thinks about the people in her life she cares about and silently sends them wishes such as, “I want you to be happy, I want you to live well.” Such mantras help her feel a loving protection over her loved ones. You can also extend the wishes to all living beings.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">5. Get plenty of exercise and sleep</span><br /><br />Exercise is not only good for your body, but your sense of well-being. It also decreases depression symptoms, Santos said.<br />Another simple thing you can do to feel better is to get as much sleep as you need, since sleep deprivation can diminish your mood, she added.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">6. Practice these happiness behaviors every day</span><br /><br />It’s like exercise: Just doing a couple of squats here and there won’t work. You have to keep working out to see results.<br />“Sometimes, you think you do these things once and you’re good and you’ll be happy forever, but that’s not the case,” Santos said.<br /><br />“One of the major lessons that comes from this work is that changing your well-being is possible, but it takes a lot of work.”<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />1.	What is happiness? Please share your comments or experience with your team members.<br />2.	According to this article of six happiness lessons, please share 3 lessons why do you agree or disagree at your table.<br />3.	Please share 5 things you are grateful for your family, teachers, friends, colleagues...etc. <br />4.	What kind of habit do you want to change to be better in your daily life?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Session II: 5 of the best exercises you can ever do</span><br /><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/5-of-the-best-exercises-you-can-ever-do" class="postlink">https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/5-of-the-best-exercises-you-can-ever-do</a><br />Harvard Medical School<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idxkLOpfdvE" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idxkLOpfdvE</a><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI4Z2ZiPwAo&amp;list=RDHQDyximQHUg&amp;index=7" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NI4Z2ZiPwAo&amp;list=RDHQDyximQHUg&amp;index=7</a><br /><br />If you're not an athlete or serious exerciser — and you just want to work out for your health or to fit in your clothes better — the gym scene can be intimidating. Just having to walk by treadmills, stationary bikes, and weight machines can be enough to make you head straight back home to the couch.<br /><br />Yet some of the best physical activities for your body don't require the gym or ask you to get fit enough to run a marathon. These &quot;workouts&quot; can do wonders for your health. They'll help keep your weight under control, improve your balance and range of motion, strengthen your bones, protect your joints, prevent bladder control problems, and even ward off memory loss.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">No matter your age or fitness level, these activities can help you get in shape and lower your risk for disease:</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">1.	Swimming</span><br /><br />You might call swimming the perfect workout. The buoyancy of the water supports your body and takes the strain off painful joints so you can move them more fluidly. &quot;Swimming is good for individuals with arthritis because it's less weight-bearing,&quot; explains Dr. I-Min Lee, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.<br /><br />Research has found that swimming can also improve your mental state and put you in a better mood. Water aerobics is another option. These classes help you burn calories and tone up.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">2.	Tai chi</span><br /><br />This Chinese martial art that combines movement and relaxation is good for both body and mind. In fact, it's been called &quot;meditation in motion.&quot; Tai chi is made up of a series of graceful movements, one transitioning smoothly into the next. Because the classes are offered at various levels, tai chi is accessible — and valuable — for people of all ages and fitness levels. &quot;It's particularly good for older people because balance is an important component of fitness, and balance is something we lose as we get older,&quot; Dr. Lee says.<br /><br />Take a class to help you get started and learn the proper form. You can find tai chi programs at your local YMCA, health club, community center, or senior center.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">3.	Strength training</span><br /><br />If you believe that strength training is a macho, brawny activity, think again. Lifting light weights won't bulk up your muscles, but it will keep them strong. &quot;If you don't use muscles, they will lose their strength over time,&quot; Dr. Lee says.<br /><br />Muscle also helps burn calories. &quot;The more muscle you have, the more calories you burn, so it's easier to maintain your weight,&quot; says Dr. Lee. Similar to other exercise, strength training may also help preserve brain function in later years.<br /><br />Before starting a weight training program, be sure to learn the proper form. Start light, with just one or two pounds. You should be able to lift the weights 10 times with ease. After a couple of weeks, increase that by a pound or two. If you can easily lift the weights through the entire range of motion more than 12 times, move up to slightly heavier weight.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">4.	Walking</span><br /><br />Walking is simple, yet powerful. It can help you stay trim, improve cholesterol levels, strengthen bones, keep blood pressure in check, lift your mood, and lower your risk for a number of diseases (diabetes and heart disease, for example). A number of studies have shown that walking and other physical activities can even improve memory and resist age-related memory loss.<br /><br />All you need is a well-fitting and supportive pair of shoes. Start with walking for about 10 to15 minutes at a time. Over time, you can start to walk farther and faster, until you're walking for 30 to 60 minutes on most days of the week.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">5.	Kegel exercises</span><br /><br />These exercises won't help you look better, but they do something just as important — strengthen the pelvic floor muscles that support the bladder. Strong pelvic floor muscles can go a long way toward preventing incontinence. While many women are familiar with Kegels, these exercises can benefit men too.<br /><br />To do a Kegel exercise correctly, squeeze the muscles you would use to prevent yourself from passing urine or gas. Hold the contraction for two or three seconds, then release. Make sure to completely relax your pelvic floor muscles after the contraction. Repeat 10 times. Try to do four to five sets a day.<br /><br />Many of the things we do for fun (and work) count as exercise. Raking the yard counts as physical activity. So does ballroom dancing and playing with your kids or grandkids. As long as you're doing some form of aerobic exercise for at least 30 minutes a day, and you include two days of strength training a week, you can consider yourself an &quot;active&quot; person.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />1.	What kind of exercises do you practice in your daily life? Why do you take it?<br />2.	This article presents &quot;5 of the best exercises”. Which exercises do you agree or not? Why?<br />3.	Have you ever done “Kegel exercises”? If you had some experiences or want to try it, please share your experiences or ideas at you table. <br />4.	How do you plan your exercise schedule in your daily life? <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Agenda:</span><br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />8:10 ~ 8:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:25 ~ 8:30pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:30 ~9:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~9:30pm Concluding remarks/feedback from newcomers<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The meeting place of Thursday:</span><br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第一區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
