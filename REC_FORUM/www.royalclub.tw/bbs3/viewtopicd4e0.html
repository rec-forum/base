			<div class="content">21 January 2021 (Thu.) A Lawyer’s Job and His Conscience? / An Interesting or Bizarre or Exotic Thing on a Flight Trip? (Host: Mark Lu)<br /><br /><span style="color: #BF0000">Place: 丹堤咖啡, 台北市延平南路107號2樓 (MRT 西門站4號出口)<br />Agenda:<br />6:30-7:15 pm Free talk<br />7:15-7:50 pm Session 1 discussion<br />7:50-8:15 pm Presentation (At least two members of each table are invited, 2 mins / each member)<br />8:15-8:45 pm Session 2 discussion<br />8:45-9:00 pm Presentation</span><br /><br /><br />Session 1: As a lawyer, what's the most mind-blowing thing you've heard your client say?<br /><br />Minutes before a child welfare hearing I noticed my client, the mother was acting a little…strange. We were in the courtroom and she was all over the place and kept chuckling to herself. I asked her if she had taken anything. She nodded, smiled, leaned over to me and in a loud stage whisper said:&quot;I just smoked a little crack&quot;, then burst out laughing!<br />EDIT: My client in this case of course did not do well in the hearing. Loudly admitting to cocaine abuse in front of a judge is never a good idea. This was perhaps one of the most “mind-blowing” things a client ever said to me, largely because we were in court at the time. I could not talk to her beforehand because she arrived literally seconds before the case was called else I would have sent her home.<br />Thinking about it, though, the most shocking thing a client has ever said came from a child. I spent years representing children. I had a seven-year-old client who had been systemically starved and beaten by her mother. When I interviewed this little girl I asked her one of my standard child interview questions, that is “What are you going to do when you grow up?” This is the point where children will generally tell their dream of being a famous singer, of playing professional ball or of being President of the United States. This girl smiled and said brightly “when I grow up I am going to kill mommy”. I asked her to repeat herself and she did. The most shocking part of it was that she knew exactly what she was saying, exactly what it meant, and that was what she dreamed of doing.<br />EDIT: Thank you for all the upvotes! I appreciate people reading this and their comments.<br />Some people have asked about what happened to each client. Well, the two could be the same person, but they are not. The mother, let’s call her Shera, had herself grown up in difficult circumstances. She was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder and self-medicated with crack. She went in and out of rehab programs, and to the best of my knowledge never completed any. I rather liked her. So did the Judge. She had more than one child and the same judge every time. Ultimately, she stopped coming to court and her children were adopted. I represented her when I was in private practice.<br />I represented the child as a Legal Aid lawyer who worked with abused and neglected children and juvenile delinquents. The child (let’s call her Millie) was the youngest of her mother’s three children. She had been named for her mother’s sister (call her Millicent). The mother had a drug problem. When Millie was born, she tested positive for cocaine. All three children went into foster care. The mom got off drugs and got the kids back, but she blamed Millie for what happened and came to hate her, so she tortured the child. After she was removed, aunt Millicent stepped up. She took custody of her namesake. I last saw Millie when she was nine. She had put on weight, was nicely dressed and well cared for. She was doing well in school and had become comfortably bi-lingual. I never met with her again. She was doing well and had made a very good recovery, with the additional help of a very skilled therapist. While I can’t help but think that she was scarred for life, I like to think she grew up and became a normal teenager.<br /><br />Points for Discussion:<br />1.	In your opinion, what is a lawyer’s job?<br /><br />2.	When you found out that your client is guilty of the charged crime, what would be your attitude or mindset to represent and defense him? If you were the lawyer in this article, you know the mother is a drug addict; would you take her money and fight the lawsuit for her? What would you do?<br /><br />3.	People always say that jurisdiction is the last defense line of justice. Please tell us what you think of it. Do you think that our justice system is independent and unbiased?<br /><br />4.	What was the most absurd verdict you ever heard of from a dinosaur judge?<br /><br />…………………………………………………………………………………………<br />Session 2: What are the weirdest things flight attendants have seen in their line of duty?<br /><br />My friend is a former flight attendant and I’ve heard her recount this story several times:<br />On a flight out of Dubai, my friend was serving breakfast to her first class passengers: a standard meal consisted of an omelet, potatoes, toast, and fruit. My friend set down a tray in front of a man dressed in ornate clothing; an imposing figure who spoke English sparsely. He inspected the meal as she continued down the aisle, and then called her over with a stern expression. When she inquired what she could help him with, he replied—in a deep voice and thick accent—“Bring me the mother.”<br />My friend, confused, asked him what he meant. He gestured to the omelet, and restated his request, even more firmly:<br />“Bring me the mother!”<br />It was very early for my friend, and she still wasn’t following. She asked again for clarification.<br />“THE MOTHER!” he shouted, getting more and more frustrated, “BRING ME THE MOTHER!”<br />Eventually she put it together and realized he was asking for the “mother” of the omelet’s eggs, i.e. he wanted some chicken. She politely informed him that chicken wasn’t an option on the breakfast menu, which made him very unhappy. <br /><br />Points for Discussion:<br />1.	Do you enjoy the food served on the airplane? <br /><br />2.	What was the tastiest food you have ever had on the airplane? Please describe the food and the airline company.<br /><br />3.	What is the uncommon food, drinks or snacks you can ask from the flight attendants based on your personal experience or what you have heard from your friends?<br /><br />4.	You can request a pillow and a blanket on an airplane. To your knowledge, are those pillows and blankets carefully washed after every flight?<br /><br />5.	Do you agree that it is relatively safe to travel on an airplane compared to riding on a train or a car? <br /><br /><span style="color: #BF0000">P.S.<br />1.因聚會地點是在咖啡店內，所以有低消80元喔！<br />2.參加三次後，只要繳交1000元 (學生:500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />3.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~</span></div>
