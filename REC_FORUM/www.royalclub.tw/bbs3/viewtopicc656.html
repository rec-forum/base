The meaning of the “life contract” is that the parties can plan their subsequent events in advance, and allow family members and relatives to return to normal life as soon as possible after the party’s death. The purpose of the “life contract” is to distribute the current economic pressure of life and reduce the emotional impact of relatives and to fulfill family responsibilities and personal dignity by means of appointment specifications and prepayments and installments.<br /><br />The characteristics of the “life contract” are: cost transparency, oversight agency, performance guarantee, 75% of the contract money is delivered to the trust, can be terminated halfway, information is transparent, and customer subjectivity.<br /> <br />And the functions of the “life contract” are:<br />1.From the perspective of risk avoidance, it can be said that it is a cost to plan for a wind that will inevitably occur.<br />2.From the perspective of life management, it provides users with the right to arrange their own affairs and maintains the user’s dignity before and after the end of life.<br />3.From the perspective of financial planning, the concept of appointments can avoid the cost increase caused by the inflation.<br />4.From the perspective of the care of surviving family, by properly arranging their own affairs, relatives can not cause emotional shock and economic crisis due to their past lives, which is also a manifestation of love and responsibility.<br /><br />Questions:<br />1.Do you agree with live contract? Why?<br />2.Explain the functions of live contract.<br />3.What can a life contract do for life?<br /> <br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Topic II: Timing<br /><br />Therefore, people who know how to do things at the right time are the same as those who do the same thing.<br />Make good use of the timing, take advantage of the times, and do things accurately and with less effort. Great!<br />At any time, you can do what you want. Although you can do it without intention, you can do more with less. Unfortunately!<br /><br />Therefore, making good use of time is learning using time.<br />What should be done at what time? It is wisdom to be able to plan and allocate things well.<br />Making good use of time, using time, and allocating things, you can achieve great things and set up a great cause. <br /><br />When and which conditions are true, it is time to do that.<br />For example, when is the time to buy stocks, and when is the time to go to the mainland to evangelize.<br /><br />What to do if you find the timing is wrong, retreat if you can. Tail off to survive. For example, the stock market.<br />To reflect on your own actions in the past, you can review whether the timing is inappropriate:<br />Study, whether the timing of studying is inappropriate, whether the timing of work is inappropriate, whether the choice of work is wrong, and so on.<br />The so-called plan and move. When you do something, you must use wisdom to think about the course of action. <br />Timing doesn’t come to those who lack thinking and planning.<br />People who think about planning will find the point of opportunity.<br /><br />Questions:<br />1.Explain what is timing? And illustrate.<br />2.Do you think the right timing is important to us? Why?<br />3.Application question: from policy perspective, what are the right things that use good timing to benefit our lives?<br /><br /><br />==========================================================<br />Agenda<br />7:00 pm-7:30 pm Free talk<br />7:30 pm-8:10 pm First topic discussion<br />8:10 pm-8:30 pm Presentation (At least two members of each table are invited)<br />8:30 pm-9:10 pm Second topic discussion<br />9:10 pm-<span style="color: #FF0000">9:30 pm</span> Presentation (Participants that haven't presented yet are invited)<br /><br />speaker time: 2 minutes for each speaker<br />host time: 3 minutes</div>
