5/25(Sat.)Life List: 100 Amazing Things To Do Before You Die/Taiwan Has Approved Same-Sex Marriage in a First for Asia(Host: Joseph)<br /><br />Notice : The first article has been shortened. Please just read the top 20 things in the first article because it is too long to read. (All of them is 100 item. It's welcome to  you to visit the website to see them.)<br /><br />Article 1: Life List: 100 Amazing Things To Do Before You Die<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://bucketlistjourney.net/45-amazing-things-to-do-before-you-die/">https://bucketlistjourney.net/45-amazin ... e-you-die/</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br />Float in the Dead Sea, see a broadway musical, stand in front of the Taj Mahal or trek to Mount Everest Base Camp—What’s on your ultimate life list? It’s never too early to start a list of incredible things to do in your lifetime.<br /><br />And this Life List has my favorite 100 things to do before you die.<br /><br />1. ✦ Volunteer at a Elephant Rescue in Thailand<br /><br />In Northern Thailand, an hour from Chiang Mai‘s city center, I spent a memorable day volunteering at the Elephant Nature Park. This is a special place where there was an eclectic bunch of Asian Elephants; some old, some young, some blind, some injured from working in the logging industry, some abused and some rescued from the circus. Not only will you be able to feed these majestic creatures, but you can also take them down to the river for a bath.<br /><br />2. ✧ Sunbathe Topless on the French Riviera<br /><br />3. ✧ Dogsled Through the Alaskan Forest<br />Alaska is home to the strenuous Iditarod Sled Dog Race, a journey that spans 1,150 miles across the rugged wilderness from Anchorage to Nome. With this life list goal, you will be able to experience the thrill of this sport first hand by meeting Iditarod racers and their powerful pooches, plus sledding along some of the mountainous terrain that their dogs train on. Read Dog Sledding in Alaska for more information.<br /><br />4. ✦ Swim in Jellyfish Lake in Palau<br />Jellyfish Lake in the Micronesian country of Palau is home to millions of jellyfish that are deemed relatively harmless since their sting is so light. It was still frightening for the first five minutes to be surrounded by jellyfish, some brushing up against my body. But, after the panic dissipated, this was one of my all-time favorite bucket list travel adventures.<br /><br />5. ✦ Explore the Acropolis in Greece<br />6. ✧ Go Gorilla Trekking in Uganda<br />Take your life list to another level and trek through the dense rain forest of Uganda to get a close encounter with the mountain gorillas of the jungle. The fact that these species are on the brink of extinction and you need to travel to faraway lands to see them adds to the experience. A great place to see them is at Bwindi Forest National Park. <br /><br />7. ✦ Volunteer at an Orphanage<br />There are orphanages all over the world to volunteer at, but I accomplished this “thing to do before you die” in Tanzania. Kibowa Orphanage is on the outskirts of downtown Arusha, hidden down a bumpy dirt road and painted in a friendly pale blue. There are 48 children that call it home and, after four days on an African safari in Tanzania, I spent a fun-filled afternoon with them. I chose to bring colorful balloons, which could be turned into animals or creative hats. It was a joy to watch the children smile as they each made their favorite shapes.<br /><br />8. ✧ Cruise on a Junk Boat through Halong Bay<br />A three-and-a-half-hour drive from the bustle of the city of Hanoi lays a peaceful set of 1,600 islands and islets, Halong Bay. This UNESCO World Heritage site has been the backdrop to many movies, including the Oscar-winning Indochine. Spend a day or a week cruising through the green-topped limestone islands and emerald waters on an ancient-style junk boat.<br /><br />9. ✦ Hike the Active Pacaya Volcano in Guatemala<br />RELATED: Guatemala’s Pacaya Volcano Hike: What to Expect<br /><br />10. ✦ Take a Christmas Market Cruise Through Europe<br />There’s nothing that can get you into the holiday spirit quite like the Christmas markets in Europe. Between the lighted cathedrals, festive markets and abundance of glühwein, it would be hard not to feel festive!<br /><br />Viking River Cruises invited me to cruise along the Rhine River to visit almost a dozen Christmas markets throughout Germany, France, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Definitely one of my favorites on the 100 things to do before you die list.<br /><br />12. ✧ Get a Henna Tattoo in India<br />13. ✧ Spend the Night in a Treehouse<br />14. ✧ Hike the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu<br />Machu Picchu is an Incan citadel that stands 2,430 meters above sea level in the mountain forest of Peru. Getting to this ancient city can be done by train, bus, or a four-day trek along the same paths that the Incans did years ago. People choose the challenging hike not only to see other ruins along the way, but for the sense of pride when reaching this UNESCO World Heritage Site by foot.<br /><br />15. ✧ Stand in Front of the Taj Mahal in India<br />16. ✦ See the Changing of the Guard in London<br />The Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace is a mesmerizing spectacle where the Old Guard hands over the security responsibility to the New Guard.The guards arrive by marching pass Victoria Monument, directly in front of Buckingham Palace, and then entering through the ornate front gates of the palace. This is combined with synchronized marching, precision drills, and the band playing. It’s a show like no other, but get there early!<br /><br />17. ✧ Hot Air Balloon over Cappadocia<br />See the surreal landscape of Cappadocia from high above in a sky dotted with colorful balloons. Cappadocia is the land in central Turkey known for its fairy chimneys (rock formations), rolling vine- yards, and troglodyte dwellings that are best seen from three thousand feet in the air. Butterfly Balloons can take you up up and away.<br /><br />18. ✦ Hear the Pope Speak at the Vatican in Italy<br />19. ✦ Release Baby Turtles into the Ocean<br />While on the Osa Peninsula of Costa Rica, I spent a memorable afternoon helping Osa Turtle Conservation. A group of us were taken to their hatchery along the beach to assist them in releasing baby Olive Ridley turtles into the ocean. Not only is it incredible knowing you are helping with these endangered animals survival, but they are adorable too! Definitely top on the list of 100 things to do before your die!<br /><br />20. ✧ Walk the Great Wall of China<br />The Great Wall of China winds up and down a series of fortifications, stretching from Shanhaiguan to Lop Lake in the Gobi Desert. The wall is one of the most recognizable and extensive construction projects built to prevent attacks of the Chinese Empire. Take a walk along a portion of the 13,170-mile-long wall, stopping at scenic spots that overlook flowing rivers and to view precious historical relics. See the Travel China Guide for more info.<br /><br />What’s on your 100 things to do before you die list?<br /><br />Discussion:<br /><br />1. Do you have lifetime to do list?<br />2. Why you put these things on your list?<br />3. What gaols do you want to achieve in your lifetime? (travel, adventure, fitness, health, financial, relationship )<br /><br /><br />////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////<br /><br />Article 2: Taiwan Has Approved Same-Sex Marriage in a First for Asia<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://time.com/5590924/taiwan-same-sex-marriage-legal-first-asia/">http://time.com/5590924/taiwan-same-sex ... irst-asia/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />(TAIPEI, Taiwan) — Taiwan’s legislature voted Friday to legalize same-sex marriage, a first in Asia and a boost for LGBT rights activists who had championed the cause for two decades.<br /><br />Lawmakers pressured by LGBT groups as well as church organizations opposed to the move approved most of a government-sponsored bill that recognizes same-sex marriages and gives couples many of the tax, insurance and child custody benefits available to male-female married couples.<br /><br />That makes Taiwan the first place in Asia with a comprehensive law both allowing and laying out the terms of same-sex marriage.<br /><br />“It’s a breakthrough, I have to say so. I could not imagine that could happen in just a few years,” said Shiau Hong-chi, professor of gender studies and communications management at Shih-Hsin University in Taiwan.<br /><br />“#Taiwan’s action today should sound a clarion call, kicking off a larger movement across #Asia to ensure equality for LGBT people and pro-active protection of their rights by governments throughout the region,” Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, wrote on Twitter. “No more excuses!”<br /><br />Thousands of people, including same-sex couples, demonstrated Friday morning in the rainy streets outside parliament before the vote. Many carried rainbow-colored placards reading “the vote cannot fail.” About 50 opponents sat under a tent outside parliament and gave speeches favoring marriage between only men and women.<br /><br />Taiwan’s Constitutional Court in May 2017 said the constitution allows same-sex marriages and gave parliament two years to adjust laws accordingly.<br /><br />The court order mobilized LGBT advocacy groups pushing for fair treatment, as well as opponents among church groups and advocates of traditional Chinese family values that stress the importance of marriage and producing offspring.<br /><br />Religion, conservative values and political systems that discourage LGBT activism have stopped momentum toward same-sex marriage in many Asian countries from Japan through much of Southeast Asia, although Thailand is exploring the legalization of same-sex civil partnerships.<br /><br />Taiwan’s acceptance of gay and lesbian relationships began in the 1990s when leaders in today’s ruling Democratic Progressive Party championed the cause to help Taiwan stand out in Asia as an open society.<br /><br />Although claimed by China as its own territory, Taiwan is a self-governing democracy with a vibrant civil society dedicated to promoting rights for sexual and ethnic minorities, women, the handicapped and others.<br /><br />Ruled by the authoritarian Communist Party, China remains much more conservative and officials have repeatedly discouraged even the discussion of legalizing same-sex marriage.<br /><br />Opponents in Taiwan raised fears of incest, insurance scams and children confused by having two mothers or two fathers. Both sides of the issue have held colorful street demonstrations and lobbied lawmakers.<br /><br />In November 2018, a majority of Taiwan voters rejected same-sex marriage in an advisory referendum. However, legislators favoring the bill, and voting separately on each item largely along party lines, said it followed the law as well as the spirit of the referendum.<br /><br />Discussion<br /><br />1. What did you think when you read the headline?<br />2. What do you know about the Same-Sex marriage?<br />3. What will be the future you could imagine?<br /><br />//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////<br /><br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00 ~ 7:30 pm greetings &amp; free talk <br />7:30 ~ 8:15 pm guests introduced &amp; first session discussion <br />8:15 ~ 8:45 pm presentation, sharing the article &amp; other experiences <br />8:45 ~ 9:30 pm second session discussion<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />a minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12531">Danny Lin</a> — Tue May 21, 2019 12:38 pm</p><hr />
