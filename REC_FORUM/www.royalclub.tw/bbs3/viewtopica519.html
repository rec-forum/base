				<div class="content">3/9(Sat.)World's biggest bee found alive &amp;The world’s dirtiest air is in India(Host: Danny)<br /><br />Article I: World's biggest bee found alive<br />Link: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-47311186">https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-47311186</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The world's biggest bee has been re-discovered, after decades thought lost to science.<br />The giant bee - which is as long as an adult's thumb - was found on a little-explored Indonesian island.<br />After days of searching, wildlife experts found a single live female, which they photographed and filmed.<br />Known as Wallace's giant bee, the insect is named after the British naturalist and explorer Alfred Russel Wallace, who described it in 1858.<br />Scientists found several specimens in 1981 on three Indonesia islands. It has not been seen alive since, although there was a report last year of two bee specimens being offered for sale online.<br />In January, a team followed in Wallace's footsteps on a journey through Indonesia in an attempt to find and photograph the bee.<br /><br />&quot;It was absolutely breathtaking to see this 'flying bulldog' of an insect that we weren't sure existed anymore, to have real proof right there in front of us in the wild,&quot; said natural history photographer, Clay Bolt, who took the first photos and video of the species alive.<br />&quot;To actually see how beautiful and big the species is in life, to hear the sound of its giant wings thrumming as it flew past my head, was just incredible. &quot;<br /><br />Wallace's giant bee (Megachile pluto)<br /><br />● an estimated wingspan of two-and-a-half inches (6 cm), Wallace's giant bee is the world's largest bee<br />● The female makes her nest in termite mounds, using her large jaw to collect sticky tree resin to line the nest and protect it from invading termites<br />●  The species depends on primary lowland forest for resin and the nests of tree-dwelling termites<br />● Wallace, who co-developed the theory of evolution with Charles Darwin, described the bee as, &quot;a large black wasp-like insect, with immense jaws like a stag-beetle&quot;.<br /><br />The discovery, in the Indonesian islands known as the North Moluccas, raises hopes that the region's forests still harbour one of the rarest and most sought after insects in the world.<br />There are currently no legal protections around its trade.<br />Trip member and bee expert Eli Wyman, an entomologist at Princeton University, said he hoped the rediscovery would spark research towards a deeper understanding of the life history of the bee and inform any future efforts to protect it from extinction.<br />Wallace's giant bee is currently listed as vulnerable to extinction, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.<br />However, the international trade of this species is currently not restricted by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.<br />Environmental group, Global Wildlife Conservation (GWC), which has launched a worldwide hunt for &quot;lost species&quot;, supported the trip to find the bee.<br />&quot;By making the bee a world-famous flagship for conservation, we are confident that the species has a brighter future than if we just let it quietly be collected into oblivion,&quot; said Robin Moore.<br />In January, the group announced they had found more rare Bolivian frogs belonging to a species thought to be down to one male.<br /><br /><br /><br />Discussion<br />1. Do you fear of bees? Please share your story or share the animal you scare.<br />2. Did you ever see any giant animal beyond your imagination? Please share the story.<br />3. The last question would be more interesting. The answer cannot be found in the article. Please discuss the reason why they need a huge body. If it is to difficult to think, you can skip it and see the next question.<br />4. Do you want to be a giant? <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Article II: The world’s dirtiest air is in India<br />Link: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2019/03/06/2003710961">http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/a ... 2003710961</a><!-- m --><br />The air quality website: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.airvisual.com/">https://www.airvisual.com/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Seven of the top 10 most polluted cities in the world are in India, according to a new study showing South Asia’s battle with deteriorating air quality and the economic toll it is expected to take worldwide.<br />Gurugram, southwest of the Indian capital of New Delhi, led all cities in pollution levels last year, even as its score improved from the previous year, according to data released by IQAir AirVisual and Greenpeace.<br />Three other Indian cities joined Faisalabad, Pakistan, in the top five.<br />The index measures the presence of fine particulate matter known as PM2.5, a pollutant that can fester deep in the lungs and bloodstream of human beings.<br />“This has enormous impacts, on our health and on our wallets,” Greenpeace Southeast Asia executive director Yeb Sano said in a statement released with the figures. “In addition to human lives lost, there’s an estimated cost of US$225 billion in lost labor, and trillions in medical costs.”<br />India, the world’s fastest-growing major economy, makes up 22 of the top 30 most polluted cities, with five in China, two in Pakistan and one in Bangladesh.<br />India racks up healthcare costs and productivity losses from pollution of as much as 8.5 percent of GDP, according to the World Bank.<br />China made marked progress in its usually dismal pollution levels, with average concentrations falling by 12 percent last year from the previous year, according to the data.<br />That should help the message Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) is to share with political party leaders on progress across three so-called “critical battles” during the National People’s Congress meetings that start this week.<br />Sano traced much of the problematic readings back to climate change. He said that burning fossil fuels is the key driver of climate change and of air pollution worldwide, and that shifting atmospheric conditions have worsened air quality and amplified forest fires.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Discussion<br />1. According to the article “This has enormous impacts, on our health and on our wallets,” What do you think? Have you ever been impacted by bad air?<br />2. Do you think the air quality is not good? Do you want to buy an air cleaner? Why or why not?<br />3. We need a good idea to improve our lives. Do you have any tips for less air pollution?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:25pm discussion session <br />8:25 ~ 8:30pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:30 ~9:30pm discussion session<br />(Session III)<br />9:30 pm Free talk<br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
