			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Section I</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Techno teachers: Finnish school trials robot educators</span><br /><br /><a href="https://ca.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1H31XT-OCATC" class="postlink">https://ca.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idCAKBN1H31XT-OCATC</a><br /><br />MARCH 27, 2018 / <br /><br />TAMPERE, Finland (Reuters) - Elias, the new language teacher at a Finnish primary school, has endless patience for repetition, never makes a pupil feel embarrassed for asking a question and can even do the “Gangnam Style” dance. Elias is also a robot. <br /><br />The language-teaching machine comprises a humanoid robot and mobile application, one of four robots in a pilot program at primary schools in the southern city of Tampere. <br /><br />The robot is able to understand and speak 23 languages and is equipped with software that allows it to understand students’ requirements and helps it to encourage learning. In this trial however, it communicates in English, Finnish and German only. <br /><br />The robot recognizes the pupil’s skill levels and adjusts its questions accordingly. It also gives feedback to teachers about a student’s possible problems. <br /><br />Some of the human teachers who have worked with the technology see it as a new way to engage children in learning. <br /><br />“I think in the new curriculum the main idea is to get the kids involved and get them motivated and make them active. I see Elias as one of the tools to get different kinds of practice and different kinds of activities into the classroom,” language teacher Riikka Kolunsarka told Reuters. <br />“In that sense I think robots and coding the robots and working with them is definitely something that is according to the new curriculum and something that we teachers need to be open minded about.” <br /><br />Elias the language robot, which stands around a foot tall, is based on SoftBank’s NAO humanoid interactive companion robot, with software developed by Utelias, a developer of educational software for social robots. <br /><br />The Maths robot - dubbed OVObot - which is a small, blue machine around 25 cm (10 inches) high and resembles an owl, was developed by Finnish AI Robots. <br /><br />The purpose of the pilot project is to see if these robots can improve the quality of teaching, with one of the Elias robots and three of the OVObots deployed in schools. The OVObots will be trialled for one year, while the school has bought the Elias robot, so its use can continue longer. <br /><br />Using robots in classrooms is not new - teaching robots have been used in the Middle East, Asia and the United States in recent years, but modern technologies such as cloud services and 3D printing are allowing smaller start-up companies to enter the sector. <br /><br /> “Well, it is fun, interesting and exciting and I’m a bit shocked,” pupil Abisha Jinia told Reuters, giving her verdict on Elias the language robot. <br />Despite their skills in language and mathematics however, the robots’ inability to maintain discipline amongst a class of primary school children means that, for the time being at least, the human teachers’ jobs are safe. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />1.	Recently, a Finnish primary school deployed 4 robot teachers --one language teacher and three math teachers—as a pilot program. Do you think robot teachers can be a trend in the future?<br />2.	What are the advantages and disadvantages of having robot teachers in classes, especially in terms of teaching English?<br />3.	With the advance of AI, do you think robot teachers can replace human teachers in the future? Why or why not?<br />4.	Imagine in Royal meetings and we have a robot teacher with us. Do you think that will improve our speaking abilities and benefit us in some way? <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Section II</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">5 Ways to Stop Resenting Other People's Achievements (So You Can Stay Focused on Your Own Path to Success)</span><br /><br /><a href="https://www.inc.com/amy-morin/5-ways-to-stop-resenting-people-who-are-more-successful-than-you-are.html" class="postlink">https://www.inc.com/amy-morin/5-ways-to-stop-resenting-people-who-are-more-successful-than-you-are.html</a><br /><br />Resentment will hold you back from reaching your greatest potential.<br /><br />Everyone experiences jealousy at one time or another. Left unchecked, however, jealousy can turn into resentment and bitterness. And those emotions can be downright destructive.<br /><br />In my therapy office, I've witnessed how destructive resentment can be. People who feel as though they don't measure up often grow consumed with hostility.<br /><br />They feel like they're not getting their fair share in life and it takes a serious toll on their health, happiness, and relationships. It also creates a downward spiral that limits their potential. <br /><br />So whether you're angry your co-worker got promoted over you, or you're feeling bad that your friends earn more money than you do, it's important to stop resenting other people's success. Here are five ways to stop feeling bitter about other people's achievements:<br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #0000FF"><br />1. Don't compare yourself to other people.</span></span><br /><br />It's easy to scroll through Facebook and think, &quot;My family doesn't have that much fun together,&quot; or &quot;I'll never be able to afford a vacation like that.&quot; But studies show envying your friends on Facebook, actually leads to depression.<br /><br />Comparing yourself to other people is like comparing apples and oranges. Your journey is unique and it's important to remember your experiences, talents, relationships, and education are different.<br /><br />When you find yourself comparing your life to someone else's life, remind yourself you're not in a race. The only person you should compare yourself to is the person you were yesterday.<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF"><span style="font-weight: bold">2. Look at the overall picture.</span></span><br /><br />The small snapshot you see of someone else's life may look much more glamorous than it really is. Just because your friend earns more money or your co-worker has an amazing side hustle, doesn't mean that person has a charmed life.<br /><br />Rather than zoom in on an individual's good fortune, zoom out to put things in proper perspective. Everyone experiences hardships of some kind. And even if an individual appears to have it altogether on the outside, remember you have no idea what sort of mental battles that individual may be fighting on the inside.<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF"><span style="font-weight: bold">3. Don't try to determine what's fair.</span></span><br /><br />Saying things like, &quot;He didn't deserve that raise because he doesn't work as hard as I do,&quot; or, &quot;It's not fair she makes so much money when she treats her employees like dirt,&quot; will only fuel your resentment.<br /><br />Trying to determine who is more deserving of good fortune isn't healthy. Life isn't always going to be--at least not in the way you view fairness. Focus on being the best version of yourself, without keeping score.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #0000FF">4. Reframe your scarcity mindset.</span></span><br /><br />Thinking good opportunities are scarce leads to a &quot;<span style="font-weight: bold">Lord of the Flies</span>&quot; mentality. And it'll cause you to believe someone else's wealth or good fortune is somehow taking something away from you. (Note:<span style="font-weight: bold"> Lord of the flies </span>means the Devil.)<br /><br />It's easy to get caught up into thinking that everything is a once in a lifetime opportunity or that other people's success means you can't succeed too. But in reality, very few things in life have a truly limited supply.<br /><br />One thing that is limited, however, is your time. And every minute you waste resenting someone else's success is 60 seconds of your life you've wasted.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #0000FF">5. Create your own definition of success.</span></span><br /><br />When you recognize that other people are running their own race in life, you'll be less likely to feel resentful of them. In fact, it's easy to celebrate their accomplishments when you view life as an opportunity to cooperate, rather than compete.<br /><br />Recognize that other people are working on their own accomplishments. Their achievements don't have to diminish or minimize your own.<br />Write down your definition of success. Think about what will make you feel good when you're 90 years old and you're looking back over your life.<br />When you keep your eyes on your own path to success, you can strive to grow mentally stronger and become better. And you'll feel less threatened by other people's achievements.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><br />Questions:</span><br />1.	The author outlined five ways to stop resenting (= feeling bitter) about other people's achievements. Do you agree? Why or Why not?<br />2.	Did you ever have any experiences of resenting other people’s achievement, which made you feel frustrated? If so, how did you deal with it?<br />3.	Which one of the 5 ways do you think is more useful to stop resenting other people's achievements and just stay focused on your own path to success?<br />4.	What’s your definition of success? And how do you pursue it?
