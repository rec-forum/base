<span style="font-weight: bold">Session I: 5 Speaking Rules you need to know</span><br /><a href="http://www.talkenglish.com/extralessons/speakingrules.aspx" class="postlink">http://www.talkenglish.com/extralessons/speakingrules.aspx</a><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">1.Don't study grammar too much</span><br /><br />This rule might sound strange to many ESL students, but it is one of the most important rules. If you want to pass examinations, then study grammar. However, if you want to become fluent in English, then you should try to learn English without studying the grammar.<br /><br />Studying grammar will only slow you down and confuse you. You will think about the rules when creating sentences instead of naturally saying a sentence like a native. Remember that only a small fraction of English speakers know more than 20% of all the grammar rules. Many ESL students know more grammar than native speakers. I can confidently say this with experience. I am a native English speaker, majored in English Literature, and have been teaching English for more than 10 years. However, many of my students know more details about English grammar than I do. I can easily look up the definition and apply it, but I don't know it off the top of my head.<br /><br />I often ask my native English friends some grammar questions, and only a few of them know the correct answer. However, they are fluent in English and can read, speak, listen, and communicate effectively.<br /><br />Do you want to be able to recite the definition of a causative verb, or do you want to be able to speak English fluently?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">2.Learn and study phrases</span><br /><br />Many students learn vocabulary and try to put many words together to create a proper sentence. It amazes me how many words some of my students know, but they cannot create a proper sentence. The reason is because they didn't study phrases. When children learn a language, they learn both words and phrases together. Likewise, you need to study and learn phrases.<br /><br />If you know 1000 words, you might not be able to say one correct sentence. But if you know 1 phrase, you can make hundreds of correct sentences. If you know 100 phrases, you will be surprised at how many correct sentences you will be able to say. Finally, when you know only a 1000 phrases, you will be almost a fluent English speaker.<br /><br />The English Speaking Basics section is a great example of making numerous sentences with a single phrase. So don't spend hours and hours learning many different words. Use that time to study phrases instead and you will be closer to English fluency.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Don't translate</span><br /><br />When you want to create an English sentence, do not translate the words from your Mother tongue. The order of words is probably completely different and you will be both slow and incorrect by doing this. Instead, learn phrases and sentences so you don't have to think about the words you are saying. It should be automatic.<br /><br />Another problem with translating is that you will be trying to incorporate grammar rules that you have learned. Translating and thinking about the grammar to create English sentences is incorrect and should be avoided.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">3.Reading and Listening is NOT enough. Practice speaking what you hear!</span><br /><br />Reading, listening, and speaking are the most important aspects of any language. The same is true for English. However, speaking is the only requirement to be fluent. It is normal for babies and children to learn speaking first, become fluent, then start reading, then writing. So the natural order is listening, speaking, reading, then writing.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><br />First Problem</span><br />Isn't it strange that schools across the world teach reading first, then writing, then listening, and finally speaking? Although it is different, the main reason is because when you learn a second language, you need to read material to understand and learn it. So even though the natural order is listening, speaking, reading, then writing, the order for ESL students is reading, listening, speaking, then writing.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Second Problem</span><br />The reason many people can read and listen is because that's all they practice. But in order to speak English fluently, you need to practice speaking. Don't stop at the listening portion, and when you study, don't just listen. Speak out loud the material you are listening to and practice what you hear. Practice speaking out loud until your mouth and brain can do it without any effort. By doing so, you will be able to speak English fluently.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><br />4.Submerge yourself</span><br /><br />Being able to speak a language is not related to how smart you are. Anyone can learn how to speak any language. This is a proven fact by everyone in the world. Everyone can speak at least one language. Whether you are intelligent, or lacking some brain power, you are able to speak one language.<br /><br />This was achieved by being around that language at all times. In your country, you hear and speak your language constantly. You will notice that many people who are good English speakers are the ones who studied in an English speaking school. They can speak English not because they went to an English speaking school, but because they had an environment where they can be around English speaking people constantly.<br /><br />There are also some people who study abroad and learn very little. That is because they went to an English speaking school, but found friends from their own country and didn't practice English.<br /><br />You don't have to go anywhere to become a fluent English speaker. You only need to surround yourself with English. You can do this by making rules with your existing friends that you will only speak English. You can also carry around an iPod and constantly listen to English sentences. As you can see, you can achieve results by changing what your surroundings are. Submerge yourself in English and you will learn several times faster.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">5.Study correct material</span><br /><br />A common phrase that is incorrect is, &quot;Practice makes perfect.&quot; This is far from the truth. Practice only makes what you are practicing permanent. If you practice the incorrect sentence, you will have perfected saying the sentence incorrectly. Therefore, it is important that you study material that is commonly used by most people.<br /><br />Another problem I see is that many students study the news. However, the language they speak is more formal and the content they use is more political and not used in regular life. It is important to understand what they are saying, but this is more of an advanced lesson that should be studied after learning the fundamental basics of English.<br /><br />Studying English with a friend who is not a native English speaker is both good and bad. You should be aware of the pros and cons of speaking with a non native speaking friend. Practicing with a non native person will give you practice. You can also motivate each other and point out basic mistakes. But you might pick up bad habits from one another if you are not sure about what are correct and incorrect sentences. So use these practice times as a time period to practice the correct material you studied. Not to learn how to say a sentence.<br /><br />In short, study English material that you can trust, that is commonly used, and that is correct.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />1.Do you agree with the 5 Speaking Rules outlined in this article? Why? Or why not? Which one of the rules you think is more important to you? Why? <br />2.How important do you think speaking ability is? Is it more important than other abilities like listening, reading or writing? How would you rank those four abilities? Why?<br />3.What do you think are the effective ways for us (ESL learners) to improve our speaking ability? Are there any kinds of methods you have tried to improve your speaking ability? Please share with us. <br />4.How to submerge yourself in English environment when you’re not living or studying in English-speaking countries? Is studying or living in English-speaking countries a guarantee for you to speak English fluently?  <br />5.What do you think about studying grammar? And how much is too much when it comes to studying grammar?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Session II: Flying 'car' could be on sale next year </span><br /><a href="https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1807/180715-flying-car-5.html" class="postlink">https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1807/180715-flying-car-5.html</a><br /><br />A new era of transport is arriving. A flying car called BlackFly, from Google co-founder Larry Page, could go on sale next year. It can travel for up to 40km at a speed of 100kph. It could cost the same as an average sports-utility car. The vehicle was tested in Canada, which has allowed its use. Even though it will fly in the sky, drivers (or pilots) will not need a pilot's license to get behind the controls. However, people who operate BlackFly will have to successfully complete a pilot's written examination. They will also receive training in how to use the vehicle.<br /><br />Critics say the term &quot;car&quot; is wrong because it has no wheels and cannot go on roads. A better description would be a person-carrying drone. The vehicle carries one person. It is powered by eight propellers. The company's CEO said: &quot;Opener is re-energizing the art of flight with a safe and affordable flying vehicle that can free its operators from the everyday restrictions of ground transportation.&quot; A former vice-president at Google said the age of personal flight is near. He said: &quot;I've noticed in my career that things go from impossible to inevitable in a very short period of time.&quot;<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />1.How would flying cars change our lives?<br />2.Would you like to buy a flying car? Imagine that if you have one, how do you like to use it and where would you like to go?<br />3.How safe would you feel in a flying car? Should people need a license to fly the car? What rules would be needed for flying cars?<br />4.What other things that you think are impossible right now might come true in the future?<br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><br />Agenda</span><br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />8:10 ~ 8:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:25 ~ 8:30pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:30 ~9:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~9:30pm Concluding remarks/feedback from newcomers<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The meeting place of Thursday:</span><br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第一區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=827">Jason Tang</a> — Thu Jul 19, 2018 11:53 pm</p><hr />
