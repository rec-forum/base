<span style="font-weight: bold">Session One</span><br /><span style="color: #BF0000">Why is adventure so important in life?</span><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.quora.com/Why-is-adventure-so-important-in-life">https://www.quora.com/Why-is-adventure- ... nt-in-life</a><!-- m --><br />Please read the quote below. ^^<br /><br />“I'd like to repeat the advice that I gave you before, in that I think you really should make a radical change in your lifestyle and begin to boldly do things which you may previously never have thought of doing, or been too hesitant to attempt. So many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservatism, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future. The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun.<br /><br />If you want to get more out of life, Ron, you must lose your inclination for monotonous security and adopt a helter-skelter style of life that will at first appear to you to be crazy. But once you become accustomed to such a life you will see its full meaning and its incredible beauty. And so, Ron, in short, get out of Salton City and hit the Road. I guarantee you will be very glad you did. But I fear that you will ignore my advice. You think that I am stubborn, but you are even more stubborn than me. You had a wonderful chance on your drive back to see one of the greatest sights on earth, the Grand Canyon, something every American should see at least once in his life. But for some reason incomprehensible to me you wanted nothing but to bolt for home as quickly as possible, right back to the same situation which you see day after day after day. I fear you will follow this same inclination in the future and thus fail to discover all the wonderful things that God has placed around us to discover.<br /><br />Don't settle down and sit in one place. Move around, be nomadic, make each day a new horizon. You are still going to live a long time, Ron, and it would be a shame if you did not take the opportunity to revolutionize your life and move into an entirely new realm of experience.<br /><br />You are wrong if you think Joy emanates only or principally from human relationships. God has placed it all around us. It is in everything and anything we might experience. We just have to have the courage to turn against our habitual lifestyle and engage in unconventional living.<br /><br />My point is that you do not need me or anyone else around to bring this new kind of light in your life. It is simply waiting out there for you to grasp it, and all you have to do is reach for it. The only person you are fighting is yourself and your stubbornness to engage in new circumstances.”<br /><br /><span style="color: #008000">Questions<br />1. What is your definition of “adventure”? Please share some examples of it with us.<br />2. What are some of the big adventures you’ve had? Do they turn out to be good in your life?<br />3. Do you agree with what is described in the article above? Is adventure really important in life?<br />4. Adventures do you good, according to the article. What are some of the reasons stop you from having adventures? If you are going to have an adventure, what would it be?</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Session Two</span><br /><span style="color: #BF0000">Adventure travel</span><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_travel">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_travel</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br />Adventure travel is a type of niche tourism, involving exploration or travel with a certain degree of risk (real or perceived), and which may require special skills and physical exertion. In the United States, adventure tourism has grown in recent decades as tourists seek out-of-the-ordinary or &quot;roads less traveled&quot; vacations, but lack of a clear operational definition has hampered measurement of market size and growth. According to the U.S.-based Adventure Travel Trade Association, adventure travel may be any tourist activity that includes physical activity, a cultural exchange, and connection with nature.<br />Adventure tourists may have the motivation to achieve mental states characterized as rush or flow, resulting from stepping outside their comfort zone. This may be from experiencing culture shock or by performing acts requiring significant effort and involve some degree of risk, real or perceived, or physical danger. This may include activities such as mountaineering, trekking, bungee jumping, mountain biking, cycling, canoeing, scuba diving, rafting, kayaking, zip-lining, paragliding, hiking, exploring, canyoneering, sandboarding, caving and rock climbing. Some obscure forms of adventure travel include disaster and ghetto tourism. Other rising forms of adventure travel include social and jungle tourism.<br /><br /><span style="color: #008000">Questions<br />1. What are some of the reasons that people choose adventure travel instead of common travel? Please make a list of them with some examples.<br />2. What adventure travel is the best to you? How about the worst?<br />3. Group activity: Please choose someone in your group as the CEO, who leads your table to open an adventure travel agency. Pick up your product and promote it. Show your customers what they can do, how long it would take and how much they need to pay for it. Don’t forget to mention what they will benefit from this special experience. We will have a vote to see who win the most customers.</span><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Agenda<br />7:00 ~ 7:30 pm greetings &amp; free talk<br />7:30 ~ 8:15 pm guests introduced &amp; first session discussion<br />8:15 ~ 8:45 pm presentation, sharing the article &amp; other experiences<br />8:45 ~ 9:30 pm second session discussion<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven,<br />板橋民生路二段237 號,<br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30,<br />a minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Royal 三峽 , Royal new branch information,<br />Every Monday evening: 8:00pm- 10pm: 摩斯漢堡 北大特區 土城區學成路712號, next to the park.<br />Please keep contact with President Ophelia.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=872">Shuman</a> — Sun Jan 05, 2020 6:15 pm</p><hr />
