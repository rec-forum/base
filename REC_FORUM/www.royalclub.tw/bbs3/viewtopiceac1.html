				<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Session I: 11 Keys for a Successful Career</span><br /><a href="https://www.inc.com/lee-colan/11-keys-for-successful-career.html" class="postlink">https://www.inc.com/lee-colan/11-keys-for-successful-career.html</a><br /><br />1.	<span style="font-weight: bold">Ask questions.</span> It is the best way to learn. Better to ask questions then to act like you know it all. It's OK to say, &quot;I am not sure, but I will get back to you with an answer by the end it the day.&quot;<br /><br />2.	<span style="font-weight: bold">Be honest always.</span> That's with yourself and with others. Your integrity is your most important asset, and it hard to establish and easy to lose.<br /><br />3.	<span style="font-weight: bold">Clear communication requires clear thinking.</span> Clarify your thoughts with an outline before writing them down, and think before you speak.<br /><br />4.	<span style="font-weight: bold">Maintain a high Say/Do ratio.</span> The best way to do this is to be cautious about what you commit to. Before you commit to a deadline (when work is due), always look at your timeline (when work actually gets done) to ensure you can keep your commitment.<br /><br />5.	<span style="font-weight: bold">Keep it simple.</span> Fewer concisely expressed words (written or spoken) are more powerful than long, flowery statements, at least in the business world.<br /><br />6.	<span style="font-weight: bold">Accept responsibility.</span> If you make a mistake, admit it, sincerely apologize then immediately take action to fix it and prevent it from happening again.<br />7.	<span style="font-weight: bold">Listen.</span> The one with the most power in the room is the person who LISTENS well, then offers input that integrates others' comments with a unique solution or perspective.<br /><br />8.	<span style="font-weight: bold">Work hard. </span>There is no substitute for hard work - show up early, leave late and be valuable in-between.<br /><br />9.	<span style="font-weight: bold">Be a team player.</span> Find ways to help others succeed. That is the ultimate job of a leader - to shine a light on others versus yourself. Others will see the leadership potential in you if you do this well. Leadership is a role you assume, not a job title.<br /><br />10.	<span style="font-weight: bold">Always be prepared.</span> Before any meeting or interaction, do your research, arrive with good questions or solutions to problems.<br /><br />11.	<span style="font-weight: bold">Take initiative and follow-up.</span> These are the bookends of success. Anticipate the needs of others. Use the 3 W's - What, Who and When - to clarify actions each party must take after meetings or conversations in the hallway.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussions questions:</span><br />1.	What’s your success secrets in terms of how to excel in your job at work?<br /><br />2.	If your boss dislike you, how do you “change your boss’s feelings” towards you? Or how do you make your boss like you?<br /><br />3.	Do you like being a “yes” man? Do you think being a “Yes” man can help your career?<br /><br />4.	Is it better to work in large company or small company? <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Session II: Manner Matters</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Introduction:</span> The Importance of Manners. Manners are something used every day to make a good impression on others and to feel good about oneself. No matter where you are - at home, work, or with friends - practicing good manners is important. ... Being polite and courteous means considering how others are feeling.<br /><br />For table manners, please refer to the following:<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Table Manners 101: Basic Dining Etiquette</span><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDGGv7z5r2c" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDGGv7z5r2c</a><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion questions:</span><br />1.
