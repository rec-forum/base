(<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://taqm.epa.gov.tw/taqm/en/">http://taqm.epa.gov.tw/taqm/en/</a><!-- m -->).<br /><br />The Air Quality Index (AQI) flashed green (good air quality) or yellow (fair to good quality) in those areas.<br /><br />However the AQI continued to flash orange at six monitoring stations in southern Taiwan -- including Yunlin, Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung and Pingtung -- meaning that the air quality in those areas remains unhealthy.<br /><br />Moreover, a red light was recorded at 12 monitoring stations in those areas, indicating that the poor air quality poses a threat to sensitive groups -- children, seniors and people with heart, respiratory and cardiovascular ailments.<br /><br />With the red light expected to remain in place for Kaohsiung and Pingtung until Saturday, the EPA advised residents in those areas to minimize physical activities if they experience eye irritation, coughing or a sore throat, or wear a face mask when outdoors.<br /><br />The EPA's AQI takes into account ozone, PM2.5 and PM10 particulates, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitric oxide concentrations in the air. <br /><br />(By Wu Hsin-yun and Flor Wang)<br />Enditem/AW<br /><br />Q1. What causes air pollution? How can we reduce the amount of air pollution?<br />Q2. What is air pollution like where you live? And where are the worst-affected areas in Taiwan and why?<br />Q3. What do you think of PM(Particulate Matter)2.5? Health experts say that PM2.5 can damage to the respiratory tract, lung’s airways, cardiovascular system, brain or liver, and cause health problems, including asthma, lung cancer, respiratory diseases, myocardial infarction, stroke, premature delivery, birth defects, low birth weight, and premature death, so how much do you worry about PM2.5? <br />Q4. How do you protect yourself when your place is subject to high levels of PM2.5?<br /><br />Session II<br />No Room for a Park? Build a Parklet.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.eslpod.com/eslpod_blog/2017/10/10/no-room-for-a-park-build-a-parklet/">https://www.eslpod.com/eslpod_blog/2017 ... a-parklet/</a><!-- m --><br />Here I am on Saturday afternoon enjoying my coffee. I’m not sitting outside of a cafe. I’m sitting at a parklet in Santa Monica.<br /><br />You know what a park is: it’s a green space with trees where people can go to enjoy nature, play sports and games, and just relax. But in a place like LA where there isn’t enough room for a lot of parks, some cities are building parklets.<br /><br />The suffix“-let” is usually used with nouns to mean something smaller than the original. For example, a booklet is a small or thin book with fewer pages than a regular book. A ringlet is a piece of hair made into a small curl, usually on little girls. When used with animals,“-let”means a baby animal: a sow (female pig) has piglets .<br /><br />These parklets or small parks are placed on the street and take the space of one or more parking spaces, next to the sidewalk (walkway along the street).<br /><br />Here’s another parklet, this one in downtown Los Angeles:<br /><br />If you don’t mind a little exhaust (gas from cars, trucks, and other vehicles), they’re a nice place to sit, relax, and people-watch (watching people go by when you don’t have anything else to do).<br /><br />~ Jeff<br />Q1.What is the most important function of parks for people? <br />Q2.Do you think that the parklet is a good idea or not in urban areas, would you use them? <br />Q3.What kind of parks will you go to most often, big, medium, or neighborhood?<br />Q4. Which is your favor park you have been to? Why?<br />Q5. What could Taiwan learn from the parks of other countries?<br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:05pm discussion session (35 mins)<br />8:05 ~ 8:20pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:20 ~ 8:25pm Regrouping <br />(Session II)<br />8:25 ~ 8:35pm Taking a 10 minutes break (Intermission)<br />8:35 ~ 9:10pm discussion session (35 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~ 9:30pm Concluding remarks/feedback from newcomers<br /><br />The meeting place of Thursday:<br />摩斯漢堡明曜店 (明曜百貨後面第二條巷子地下室)<br />台北市大安區仁愛路四段151巷37號B1樓<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運 - 板南線 - 忠孝敦化站 (步行約5分鐘)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
