			<div class="content">How to Recognize Burnout Before You’re Burned Out<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://cn.nytstyle.com/career/20170913/workplace-burnout-symptoms/en-us/">https://cn.nytstyle.com/career/20170913 ... oms/en-us/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Emma Seppala was working as an intern at The International Herald Tribune (the past iteration of The International New York Times) one summer in college in Paris, shuttling between the newsroom writers and editors on the second floor and the workers at the printing presses in the basement.<br />Ms. Seppala, the science director at the Stanford Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education, mulls the difference between the two starkly different atmospheres in her 2016 book “The Happiness Track”: One floor was raucous and full of laughter, the other floor was solemn and quiet. Can you guess which one she enjoyed being in more?<br />It was the press workers who had a sideboard covered with wine, cheeses and bread. They were vibrant, Ms. Seppala writes. “I believe most of us want to be like the French press workers: we want to do a good job no matter what that job might be — and we also want to be happy doing it.”<br />She later notes, “We have simply accepted overextension as a way of life.”<br />In today’s era of workplace burnout, achieving a simpatico work-life relationship seems practically out of reach. Being tired, ambivalent, stressed, cynical and overextended has become a normal part of a working professional life. The General Social Survey of 2016, a nationwide survey that since 1972 has tracked the attitudes and behaviors of American society, found that 50 percent of respondents are consistently exhausted because of work, compared with 18 percent two decades ago.<br />Where once the term burnout was applied exclusively to health care workers, police officers, firefighters, paramedics or social workers who deal with trauma and human services — think Graham Greene’s novel “A Burnt-Out Case,” about a doctor in the Belgian Congo, a book that gave rise to the term colloquially — the term has since expanded to workers who are now part of a more connected, hyperactive and overcompensating work force.<br />But occupational burnout goes beyond needing a simple vacation or a family retreat, and many experts, psychologists and institutions, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, highlight long-term and unresolvable burnout as not a symptom but rather a major health concern. (Though it does not appear in the Diagnostic Statistic Manual, the benchmark for psychological ailments, it does appear in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, a classification used by the World Health Organization.)<br />“We’re shooting ourselves in the foot,” Ms. Seppala told me. “Biologically we are not meant to be in that high-stress mode all the time. We got lost in this idea that the only way to be productive is to be on the go-go-go mode.”<br />It is difficult to identify burnout, which often feels like surrender or failure rather than what it really is: a chronic disease.<br />Common Work Stressors<br />• Overcoming challenges associated with new software, changing atmospheres or different processes<br />• Unrealistic deadlines<br />• Frequent scheduling conflicts or interruptions<br />• Unpredictable schedules<br />• Physical demands like exposure to weather or heavy lifting<br />• Added responsibility beyond the initial scope of one’s role while not being compensated for the supervision<br />• Interpersonal demands such as interactions with colleagues or customers<br />These stressors can manifest in outbursts against co-workers, violence or anger toward loved ones at home, loss of appetite and passion for things once loved, or being unable to find motivation for things that you were able to accomplish with ease.<br />The pioneering researcher behind the study of burnout since the 1970s, Christina Maslach, professor emerita of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, conducted a study that concluded there are three major signs of workplace burnout.<br />Signs of Burnout to Watch For<br />According to Dr. Maslach’s study, common signs of burnout include:<br />• Feeling emotionally drained and mentally unwell. Nausea. Being unable to sleep or constantly fighting sicknesses like head colds.<br />• Feeling alienated by your colleagues and bosses, feeling constantly underappreciated, or feeling ostracized by them.<br />• Feeling you are not personally achieving your best, or regularly “phoning it in.”<br />“There are a lot of things that can happen when people begin to have this problem at work,” Dr. Maslach said. “There are things like absenteeism, turnover, but also things in terms of errors, not being careful about the work they’re doing. We see a lot of difficulty with people getting along with each other — angry, aggressive.”<br />In 1981, Dr. Maslach and her colleagues devised the “Maslach Burnout Inventory.” It is still used today to determine whether an employee is experiencing burnout that may be causing performance or personal issues.<br />“Stress phenomenon can take a toll in terms of physical health, which can then get tied into absenteeism. There are a number of ways in which the quality of the work goes down as a result of burnout,” she said.<br />If anyone complains about it, she said, they’re automatically labeled a wimp.<br />“Quite honestly in America we glorify stress,” Dr. Maslach said. “And that’s another thing that leads people to be quiet and shut up about some of the stressors they’re facing because they don’t want to be viewed about not doing their best.”<br />Ways to Combat Burnout at Work<br />If you’re suffering from burnout at work, or if any of those symptoms sound familiar to you, there are a few things you can do now, before you get some time off to recover. (Although you should definitely consider some time off to recover, if you can.)<br />• Focused breathing, which can tap into your parasympathetic nervous system to help you reduce or manage stress.<br />• Frequent breaks, preferably five-minute breaks for every 20 minutes spent on a single task, or sitting at your desk.<br />• Ergonomic chairs and desks, like a sit-stand arrangement, or even a small plant in your office space.<br />• A trusted mentor at work with whom you can discuss and strategize other ways to deal with work-related issues.<br />• A hobby outside of work through which you can decompress, de-stress and dissociate from work. It doesn’t have to be anything specific, but regular exercise or another fitness activity works wonders here, and has benefits beyond stress relief.<br />If you have the ability to work remotely, that’s another great way to add stress-reducers to your life. Periodically working out of the office enables you to try working from a quiet and contemplative space in which creativity may grow. It could also allow for more time outdoors. But broadly speaking, Dr. Maslach said, it is the human connection that’s most effective at combating burnout.<br />“What we found is that people’s health, well-being, everything in life, is way better if you’re connected with other people,” she said. “That social network, that each of you have each other’s back, that they’re there for you and you’re there for them, that’s like money in the bank. That’s a precious, precious resource.”<br />Jason Lang is the team leader of Workplace Health Programs within the C.D.C. He says that aside from good diet, exercise and sleep, there’s one surefire way to combat general malaise, job dissatisfaction, low morale and burnout.<br />“Laughter,” he said. “Find some humor in daily life.”<br /><br />1.	What kind of stress are you usually facing during your work?<br />2.	How do you solve the stressed during your life? Is it usually useful?<br />3.	How do you release your stress?<br />4.	Do you agree “The stress could make people growth”? Do you like coexist with the stress?<br />==========================================================================================================<br /><br />An Hour of Running May Add 7 Hours to Your Life<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://cn.nytstyle.com/health/20170413/running-life/en-us/">https://cn.nytstyle.com/health/20170413 ... ife/en-us/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Running may be the single most effective exercise to increase life expectancy, according to a new review and analysis of past research about exercise and premature death. The new study found that, compared to nonrunners, runners tended to live about three additional years, even if they run slowly or sporadically and smoke, drink or are overweight. No other form of exercise that researchers looked at showed comparable impacts on life span.<br />The findings come as a follow-up to a study done three years ago, in which a group of distinguished exercise scientists scrutinized data from a large trove of medical and fitness tests conducted at the Cooper Institute in Dallas. That analysis found that as little as five minutes of daily running was associated with prolonged life spans.<br />After that study was released, the researchers were inundated with queries from fellow scientists and the general public, says Duck-chul Lee, a professor of kinesiology at Iowa State University and co-author of the study. Some people asked if other activities, such as walking, were likely to be as beneficial as running for reducing mortality risks.<br />High-mileage runners wondered if they could be doing too much, and if at some undefined number of miles or hours, running might become counterproductive and even contribute to premature mortality.<br />And a few people questioned whether running really added materially to people’s life spans. Could it be, they asked rather peevishly, that if in order to reduce your risk of dying by a year, you had to spend the equivalent of a year’s worth of time on the trails or track, producing no discernible net gain?<br />So for the new study, which was published in March in Progress in Cardiovascular Disease, Lee and his colleagues set out to address those and related issues by reanalyzing data from the Cooper Institute and also examining results from a number of other large-scale recent studies looking into the associations between exercise and mortality.<br />Over all, this new review reinforced the findings of the earlier research, the scientists determined. Cumulatively, the data indicated that running, whatever someone’s pace or mileage, dropped a person’s risk of premature death by almost 40%, a benefit that held true even when the researchers controlled for smoking, drinking and a history of health problems such as hypertension or obesity.<br />Using those numbers, the scientists then determined that if every nonrunner who had been part of the reviewed studies took up the sport, there would have been 16% fewer deaths over all and 25% fewer fatal heart attacks. (One caveat: The participants in those studies were mostly white and middle class.)<br />Perhaps most interesting, the researchers calculated that, hour for hour, running statistically returns more time to people’s lives than it consumes. Figuring two hours per week of training, since that was the average reported by runners in the Cooper Institute study, the researchers estimated that a typical runner would spend less than six months actually running over the course of almost 40 years, but could expect an increase in life expectancy of 3.2 years, for a net gain of about 2.8 years.<br />In concrete terms, an hour of running statistically lengthens life expectancy by seven hours, the researchers report.<br />Of course, these additions “are not infinite,” Lee says. Running does not make people immortal. The gains in life expectancy are capped at about three extra years, he says, however much people run.<br />The good news is that prolonged running does not seem to become counterproductive for longevity, he continues, according to the data he and his colleagues reviewed. Improvements in life expectancy generally plateaued at about four hours of running per week, Lee says. But they did not decline.<br />Meanwhile, other kinds of exercise also reliably benefited life expectancy, the researchers found, but not to the same degree as running. Walking, cycling and other activities, even if they required the same exertion as running, typically dropped the risk of premature death by about 12%. (To make my own biases clear, I run, but I also love cycling and walk my dogs every day.)<br />Why running should be so uniquely potent against early mortality remains uncertain, Lee says. But it is likely, he says, that it combats many of the common risk factors for early death, including high blood pressure and extra body fat, especially around the middle.<br />It also raises aerobic fitness, he says, and high aerobic fitness is one of the best-known indicators of an individual’s long-term health.<br />Of course, the findings in this new review are associational, meaning that they prove that people who run tend also to be people who live longer, but not that running directly causes the increases in longevity. Runners typically also lead healthy lives, Lee says, and their lifestyles may be playing an outsize role in mortality.<br />But even taking that possibility into consideration, he says, the data suggest that running could add years to our lives.<br /><br />1.
