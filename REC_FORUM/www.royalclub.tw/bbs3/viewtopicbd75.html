The coronavirus, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has already killed 17 people. It has spread to the USA, Japan, Korea and Thailand. More than 540 people have caught the virus and are in hospital. The World Health Organization (WHO) is meeting to decide whether the outbreak is a global health emergency. China is urging people not to panic ahead of the Chinese New Year next week. Millions of Chinese will be travelling across the country to spend the holiday season with their families. Meanwhile, the city of Wuhan has suspended its public transport systems to help stop the spread of the virus.<br /><br />The new coronavirus is suspected to have come from illegally traded animals in a Wuhan market. The virus mutated and spread from an animal to a human. There are fears it could mutate and spread further. Scientists say the virus is contagious and can be passed from person to person through the air. Dr Linfa Wang, a virologist at the Duke-National University of Singapore, said the new coronavirus is in the same family as SARS, but it's different from SARS. He said people needed to look for pneumonia-like symptoms, such as fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Fu Ning, a 36-year-old woman from Beijing, said: &quot;I feel fearful because there's no cure for the virus.&quot;<br /><br />Q1. What do you know about the coronavirus?<br />Q2.

Though these businessescan be found from Japan to Germany, the first-ever cat café in the world is believed to have started in Taiwan in 1998. The owner Tracy Chang of Taipei's Cat Flower Garden tells us how she came up with the idea and why her café continues to attract many customersafter more than two decades in business. The café, now called Caféand Cats, is located in Shilin District, 1F, No. 129 Fuhua Rd. just across the street from the ZhishanMRT Station.<br /><br />Q1. Can you be a dog person or a cat person? Do “dog people” like cats or other pets?<br />Q2. Why is the pet business booming? Does it have anything to do with smaller/no children families? <br />Q3. Have you ever raised a pet? If yes, what is your experience? If not, why not?<br />Q4. If you have a dog, which dog friendly restaurant do you usually go to? If you don’t have a pet, will you care if a dog is next to your table in the restaurant?<br />Q5. Do dogs and cats appeal to people with different personalities?<br />Q6. Will you visit Caféand Cats after reading the article?<br /><br />==========================================================<br />Agenda<br />7:00 pm-7:30 pm Free talk<br />7:30 pm-8:10 pm First topic discussion<br />8:10 pm-8:30 pm Presentation (At least two members of each table are invited)<br />8:30 pm-9:10 pm Second topic discussion<br />9:10 pm-9:30 pm Presentation (Participants that haven't presented yet are invited)<br /><br />speaker time: 2 minutes for each speaker<br />host time: 3 minutes<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
