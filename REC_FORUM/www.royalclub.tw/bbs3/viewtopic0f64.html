				<h3>3/29 Tackle Ethical Dilemma/ Are good looking people jerks? (Host: Danny)</h3>

				<div class="content"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Session 1</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Tackle Ethical Dilemma.</span><br /><br />Michael had several friends including Roger and Daniel. Roger has recently met and started dating a wonderful lady named Phyllis. He is convinced this is a long term relationship. Unknown to Roger, Michael observed them at a restaurant several days ago and realized Phyllis is the wife of his other friend Daniel.<br /><br />Michael is deciding whether to tell Roger that Phyllis is married when he receives a call from Daniel. Daniel suspects his wife is having an affair and since they and Michael share many friends and contacts, he asks if Michael has heard anything regarding an affair.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />Q1: Any consequences for each of these options below?<br />1.	turning a blind eye.<br />2.	conceal the truth.<br />3.	call your friends furiously and tell them to take a revenge.<br />4.	patching up the quarrel (recommend them to reconcile).<br />5.	Other else…..<br />Q2: Whoever Michael tells, he is going to end up hurting one, do you have any good methods to tackle the issue without hurting anyone?<br />Q3: After completing the issue, do you think Daniel should forgive Phyllis or just let her go?<br />Q4: Culturally, we’ve been told to be dissuaded people from getting divorce or breaking up no matter any wrongdoings who has done. Is it a good way to do so for a long-term relationship or just postpone the problem further? <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Session 2</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Are gook looking people jerks?</span><br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ907Aa7TYE" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ907Aa7TYE</a><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />Q1: Have you ever found any example that good looking people were not jerks or they were really jerks? Show us an example?<br />Q2: Does “good looking” really matters when looking for jobs or making new friends? what are the pros and cons of being good looking people or pretty girls? <br />Q3: “I have a crush on someone who is really nice, and kinda good looking/beautiful. The thing is, a lot of girls/boys hit on him/her, and I don't know what to do!! Help??” if your children/friends asks you for a help with the question above, what is your answer? Any concerns could be getting involved?<br />Q4: Either appearance or inner-beauty you could pick only for your imaginary lover, which one do you prefer? Tell us Why?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">References:</span><br />Definition from Cambridge dictionary:  a stupid person, usually a man.<br />Definition from Google dictionary:  a contemptibly obnoxious person<br />Definition from Yahoo dictionary: 【美】【俚】蠢人；古怪的人: 卑鄙的人<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Agenda</span><br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />8:10 ~ 8:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:25 ~ 8:30pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:30 ~9:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~9:30pm Concluding remarks/feedback from newcomers<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">The meeting place of Thursday:<br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第一區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文<br /></span></div>
