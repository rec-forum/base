Are there any episodes or news to share?<br /><br />2. “women are more likely than men to suffer from hunger and malnourishment. That’s because in many cases, women eat last and least.”<br />Do you know the possible reasons why women eat last and least in some countries?<br /><br />3. “In high-income countries, 40 percent of food is wasted.”<br />How often do you check your refrigerator? Is your refrigerator always full? Are you overbought? How do you manage your food purchases without wasting food?<br /><br />4. Do you buy expiring food at the supermarket? If not, why?<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Session II<br />Spain plans to control food waste – and all restaurants must offer ‘doggy bags’<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.spainenglish.com/2022/06/08/spain-plans-to-control-food-waste-and-all-restaurants-must-offer-doggy-bags/">https://www.spainenglish.com/2022/06/08 ... oggy-bags/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Questions:<br />1. How do you judge this new draft bill? Can it effectively control food waste?<br /><br />2. Do you use dog bags to take leftover food home at a restaurant/wedding reception? Share your experience.<br /><br />3. Do you often cook? What do you do with leftovers? Do you usually eat leftovers at your next meal?<br /><br />4. Many people like to  prepare/order  so many dishes at meals or parties. Is it related to one's habits/culture?<br /><br />P.S.<br />1.參加三次(含實體及線上會議)後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />2.請帶著開放的心與熱情來參加全英文會話聚會!</div>
