By Kelsey Lark Mar 9, 2019  <br />Nestle’s global coffee brand Nescafe recently opened their first permanent nap cafe in Oimachi in the business district of Shinagawa on March 6.The cafe, called Nescafe Sleep Cafe, provides leather reclining chairs and beds where customers can go to enjoy Nescafe’s Gold Blend coffee and get anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 full hours of sleep. Nescafe has opened three pop-up cafes blending sleep and coffee in the past, and they must have performed well because this Oimachi cafe is here to stay! While we can’t exactly say that the real thing looks as luxury-meets-futuristic as the concept images, the Nescafe Sleep Cafe is a solid step-up from your average smoke-scented manga kissa (Internet cafes stocked with manga that can double-up as uncomfortable overnight accommodation) and provides a nice haven for the tired Tokyo masses.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Choose between a nap or a sleep course</span><br /><br />Nescafe Sleep Cafe offers two types of course: a nap course and a sleep course. The nap courses start from ¥750 (US$6.71) for a 30-min nap on one of their reclining chairs, and sleep courses start from ¥1,500 (US$13.43) for one hour with a choice of reclining chair or bed. Of course, it wouldn’t be a cafe without coffee, and the Nescafe Sleep Cafe delivers on that front. Shorter courses include one complimentary coffee, and longer courses include one decaffeinated coffee before lying down and one caffeinated coffee when you wake up — giving you an extra energy boost to get back to the office or continue exploring Tokyo.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Customize your course to get the best nap possible</span><br /><br />Along with providing amenities and maintaining an optimal temperature for sleep, Nescafe Sleep Cafe also offers the following customizable options to help you achieve maximum relaxation:<br />•	Choice of stiffness in pillows and mattresses (so none of those awful bean pillows)<br />•	Smart lights with customizable colors and brightness levels<br />•	A smart eye mask that monitors sleep patterns which you’ll get a record of when you leave<br />Whether you’re looking for a concept cafe with beds and the soothing sounds of snoring on your next trip in Tokyo or simply need an afternoon off to catch up on z’s, Nescafe Sleep Cafe is here to help you have the nap of your dreams. <br /><br />Discussions: <br />1.	Do you agree that taking a nap will boost your energy and enhance your working efficiency in the afternoon? Would you like to have a try to take a nap in such place if you get a chance to visit Japan?<br />2.	Do you have a habit to take a nap ? How do you take a nap in the office, sleeping on your stomach on the chair ? <br />3.	According to the statistic, insomnia problem is quite common in the modern time. Do you have this problem and how do you improve the sleeping quality?<br />4.	Providing amenities and maintaining an optimal temperature will help us to have a good sleep. Do you think a luxurious bed will also help you sleep well ? <br /><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Iceland's four-day working week trials an 'overwhelming success', report finds, 6 Jul, 2021</span><br /><br />Trials of a four-day working week in Iceland have been lauded an &quot;overwhelming success&quot;, with research revealing the initiative helped increase productivity, and led to an overall improvement in workers' wellbeing. The trials, run by Reykjavík City Council and the Icelandic government, were held between 2015 and 2019, and ultimately included more than 2,500 workers — or about one per cent of Iceland's working population. As part of the project, employees from a range of professions — including offices, kindergartens, social service providers and hospitals — moved from a 40-hour working week, to a 35- or 36-hour working week, but received the same pay. Research into the trials, published this month by researchers from the UK think tank Autonomy and Iceland's Association for Sustainable Democracy (Alda), noted that following the trials' success, trade unions &quot;achieved permanent reductions in working hours for tens of thousands of their members across the country&quot;. In total, roughly 86 per cent of Iceland’s entire working population has &quot;now either moved to working shorter hours or have gained the right to shorten their working hours&quot;, the report found, adding that such reductions were won in contracts negotiated between 2019 and 2021.&quot;This study shows that the world’s largest-ever trial of a shorter working week in the public sector was by all measures an overwhelming success,&quot; said Will Stronge, director of research at Autonomy. &quot;It shows that the public sector is ripe for being a pioneer of shorter working weeks – and lessons can be learned for other governments.&quot;<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">'Like a gift from the heavens'</span><br /><br />Despite concerns a shorter working week would unintentionally lead to overwork, the results of the trials &quot;directly contradict this&quot;, the report found.Rather, a reduction in working hours led to staff working less as a &quot;direct result&quot; of workplaces implementing new work strategies, while productivity and service provision &quot;remained the same or improved across the majority of trial workplaces&quot;. &quot;Organisation was key to working less — and the reward of reduced hours provoked people to organise their work more efficiently — with changes made to how meetings were run, as well as schedules, and in some cases to opening hours,&quot; the report noted. &quot;In some instances, meetings were avoided by instead sending emails or exchanging information electronically. &quot;The trials also resulted in a marked improvement in worker wellbeing, which increased across a range of indicators, from perceived stress and burnout to health and work-life balance. One manager, who took part in the initiative, remarked: &quot;I work less … For me it is like a gift from the heavens. And I like it a lot&quot;.<br />&quot;The Icelandic shorter working week journey tells us that not only is it possible to work less in modern times, but that progressive change is possible too,&quot; said Gudmundur D Haraldsson, a researcher at Alda.<br /><br />1.	Do you agree that longer working hour will boost higher productivity ?  How often do you work overtime?  <br />2.	Are you willing to work overtime with higher pay? Or you will choose the companies with working hours less but also pay less ? <br />3.	If you get a chance to work in TSMC, but you may need to work overtime often, will you accept the job ? <br />4.	Do you agree “burnout” depletes the ability of workers to be productive and less working hours will boost and increase the productivity?<br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">P.S.<br />1.參加三次後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />2.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~</span></div>
