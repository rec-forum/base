Please share your opinions with your group members.<br /><br />3.Have you ever purchased something with good brand name but the quality or price doesn’t worth it? What will you do? (don’t buy it next time, tell the store clerk, write the letter to the company….)<br /><br />4.Where do you usually purchase things/groceries? (from convenient store, supermarket, website…),  How do you think of the quality?<br /><br />5.For the medicine, generic drugs are the same as the brand name.
