It is the first time Japan has had such a minister. Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga created the role in early February. He asked Tetsushi Sakamoto to fill the new position. Mr Suga wanted to do something about the rise in suicide cases. The number of people taking their own lives has risen during the pandemic. Japan's National Police Agency showed that 20,919 people died by suicide in 2020. This is 750 more than the previous year. It is also first consecutive rise in suicides in 11 years. Mr Sakamoto told reporters: &quot;I hope to promote activities that prevent loneliness and social isolation and to improve the ties between people.&quot;<br /><br />The police agency reported that there has been a much bigger rise in suicides among women and young people. Prime Minister Suga said women have been struggling with loneliness since the coronavirus pandemic started in early 2020. He told reporters: &quot;Women are suffering from isolation more than men are, and the number of suicides is on a rising trend.&quot; There has been a 70 per cent year-on-year increase in the number of women taking their own lives. Yoko Suzuki, a 23-year-old designer who lives in Tokyo, said she has suffered from loneliness since coronavirus started. She said: &quot;Not seeing people smile behind their mask makes me sad and lonely.&quot; She added: &quot;I want to see happy faces.&quot;<br /><br />Q1. What do you know about loneliness?<br />Q2. What do you think of the idea of a minister of loneliness?<br />Q3. What can the minister do to help with social isolation?<br />Q4. Why are women suffering from isolation more than men?<br />Q5. How would you deal with isolation?<br /><br />Session II: Electric-car battery charges in five minutes<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://breakingnewsenglish.com/2101/210124-car-battery.html">https://breakingnewsenglish.com/2101/21 ... ttery.html</a><!-- m --><br />Car makers are spending a lot of money on electric cars. In the future, electric cars will replace petrol cars. Environmentalists believe this will reduce the amount of CO2 put into the atmosphere. A big problem for electric cars is charging the battery. Some batteries in today's electric cars can take up to 12 hours to charge fully. However, a company in Israel says it has created a lithium-ion battery that people can charge in just five minutes. This is the same amount of time it takes to fill a tank of gas with petrol. The new lithium-ion batteries were developed by the Israeli company StoreDot. They are being manufactured by a Chinese company called Eve Energy.<br /><br />The new batteries could totally transform driving. They would mean electric cars would be able to travel as far as petrol cars. Many people with electric cars today suffer from &quot;range anxiety&quot;. This is stress caused by worrying about the battery running out of electricity. A StoreDot spokesperson said: &quot;You're either afraid that you're going to get stuck on the highway, or that you're going to need to sit in a charging station for two hours.&quot; The new batteries would end this anxiety. A StoreDot spokesperson said: &quot;We're at the point of achieving a revolution in the electric vehicle charging experience&quot;. He said it means the switch from petrol to electric cars will happen much faster.<br />1. What do you think of electric cars?<br />2. In what ways are electric cars better than petrol cars?<br />3. How bad are petrol cars for the environment?<br />4. Would you prefer an electric or petrol car?<br />5. How might the new battery change driving?<br /><br />///////////////////////////////////////////////////////<br />Agenda<br />7:00 ~ 7:30 pm greetings &amp; free talk<br />7:30 ~ 8:15 pm guests introduced &amp; first session discussion<br />8:15 ~ 8:45 pm presentation, sharing the article &amp; other experiences<br />8:45 ~ 9:30 pm second session discussion<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven,<br />板橋民生路二段237 號,<br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30,<br /><br />P.S.<br />1.因聚會地點是在咖啡店內，所以有低消80元喔！<br />2.參加三次後，只要繳交1000元 (學生:500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />3.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~</div>
