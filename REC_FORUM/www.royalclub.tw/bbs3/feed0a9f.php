Are men really more forgetful than women? <br /><br />Men are more forgetful than women, study shows<br />Written by Honor Whiteman on January 26, 2014<br /><br />Men are frequently accused of forgetting birthdays, wedding anniversaries, and even something as simple as taking the trash out. But they have developed this stigma for a reason, a new study suggests; it found that men are more forgetful than women, regardless of their age.<br /><br />The study participants were asked nine questions about their memory. These included questions regarding whether their memory has changed since they were younger, and whether they have problems remembering dates or what events happened a few days or years ago.<br /><br />Men ‘just as forgetful whether aged 30 or 60’<br />The results revealed that approximately half of the participants reported memory problems. Of these, 1.2% were women, while 1.6% were men. For eight out of nine questions, men reported the most problems.<br /><br />Overall, the researchers found that memory problems increased with age. But in all age groups, men reported more memory problems than women.<br /><br />Furthermore, the investigators were surprised to find that younger men forget just as much as older men.<br /><br />Commenting on the findings, Prof. Holmen says:<br />“It was surprising to see that men forget more than women. This has not been documented before. It was also surprising to see that men are just as forgetful whether they are 30 or 60 years old. The results were unambiguous.”<br /><br />Reason for gender differences in memory ‘a mystery’<br />The researchers hypothesize that gender differences in memory may be down to a number of reasons.<br /><br />For example, they may be linked to risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as high blood pressure or high body mass index (BMI).<br /><br />These risk factors, which are more prevalent in men, may trigger forms of neurodegeneration – explaining why men have more memory problems than women.<br /><br />But the researchers note that their study found no evidence pointing to this as the reason. Therefore, the gender differences in memory are still unclear.<br /><br />Early signs of dementia<br />The researchers say they plan to carry out further studies to determine whether individuals who report having memory problems at a younger age may have an increased risk of developing dementia.<br /><br />Last year, Medical News Today reported on a study suggesting men’s brains are wired differently to women’s brains, which may explain why men excel at some tasks, and women at others.<br /><br /><br />Why do so many men skip regular health checkups?<br />According to a national survey, one-third of men do not think they need annual health screenings.<br /><br />According to Dr. Kelley: “Even if you think you’re healthy and you’re not experiencing any symptoms, there can be developing issues that often go unnoticed and can also be life-threatening if left unchecked [including] rising blood pressure that can be a ticking time bomb for a heart attack or stroke, as well as colon cancer, which is one of the most deadly yet preventable cancers that exist.”<br /><br /><br />Men think they are ‘Supermen’<br />Doctors and public health experts have been studying men’s attitudes to healthcare for a long time. They have heard a plethora of justifications for not seeking medical attention.<br /><br />Dr. Kelley said that men often focus on the health of everyone else but themselves. Almost 40% of the men surveyed even prioritize their pets’ health over their own.<br /><br />Dr. Movassaghi mentioned several factors behind men’s hesitance to get medical attention. He said that many men feel or want to appear invincible:<br /><br />Glimmers of change<br />Dr. Movassaghi has seen evidence that men’s attitudes towards health care is slowing changing for the better.<br /><br />He pointed out that an increased focus on men’s health and wellness is encouraging men to take their health more seriously.<br /><br />He also alluded to research showing that women largely influence how often men visit a physician. They are more likely to go as boys if their mothers regularly visit a doctor.<br /><br /><br />Putting oneself first<br />Dr. Kelley stresses that “in order to take care of others in your life, you first have to take care of yourself, and that includes making that yearly appointment with your primary care doctor.”<br /><br />He pointed out that medical visits combined with a healthy diet, regular exercise, drinking plenty of water, and reducing stress can go a long way in maintaining and improving overall health.<br /><br />Questions:<br />1. Why do women have better memory than men?<br />2. Why do women remember faces better than men?<br />Do women have better memory skills than men?<br />3. Why do I forget things so easily?<br />4. What causes lack of attention and forgetfulness?<br /><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Session II: Impromptu speech<br /><br />Each person prepares two questions for the sub-group discussion. <br />In the group presentation members take turns to ask and answer questions. <br />The speaking time is two minutes.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=46353">Ellen Lu</a> — Fri Oct 14, 2022 9:23 am</p><hr />
