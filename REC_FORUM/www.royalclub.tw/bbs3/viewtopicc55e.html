			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">7 Tips for Creating Your Own Destiny</span><br />Are you working on your life or just in it? Here is the perspective and method you need to plan and execute the life and career worthy of your potential.<br />By Kevin Daum<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.inc.com/kevin-daum/7-tips-for-creating-your-own-destiny.html">https://www.inc.com/kevin-daum/7-tips-f ... stiny.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Too many people whine about not having the life they want. The main reason people fall short of their own expectations is the same reason most companies fail to achieve their objectives: poor planning and execution. In fact, I am amazed at how many successful executives create strategy for their business, leaving their life to chance. Often it's more comfortable (note I didn't say easier) to complain and blame outside factors for lack of accomplishment or unhappiness than to take time to work on life rather than in it.<br />I choose otherwise. A close entrepreneur friend, J, and I are taking our annual four days away to determine our futures and hold each other accountable. Here are the tips that will assure us success.<br /><br />1. Plan a Preferred Future<br />As Lewis Carroll said: If you don't know where you are going, then any road will get you there. Both J and I are close to 50, so our 60th birthdays are the milestone for this journey. Twelve years is plenty of time to make course corrections and absorb any external factors thrown at us. Our planning will be specific and measurable. We'll take time to examine and discuss the details of every aspect of our lives, personal and professional, to achieve integrated success and happiness. <br /><br />2. Be Pragmatic<br />Neither of us will be playing for the NBA at our age (or my height). The future has to reflect what is physically possible with available resources and limitations. Pragmatism isn't in itself restrictive, however; J and I will harness our creativity to design aspirational futures that exploit every opportunity and asset we have. We'll also create filters to keep us from wasting time and energy on what's unachievable or irrelevant.<br /><br />3. Decide the Who, Not the What<br />We're defining who we want to be at 60, not what we want to be doing. The who centers on passion, core competencies, and core satisfaction, such as material requirements. If I know who I truly want to be, I can detail what to do, what to own, resources I need, etc. I can also determine what not to do, own, etc., focusing time and resources where required.<br /><br />4. Be Honest<br />J and I will challenge each other constantly to get to the truth of who we are and who we wish to be. There will be no quiet politeness on this trip (not that I'm capable of it). I can't let J believe his own stories and rationalizations, causing misdirection and distraction. Warning: Allowing this dialogue requires intimate knowledge of each other and great trust. Pick your accountability partners wisely.<br /><br />5. Consider the Tools Around You, Old and New<br />Every resource is important. On my old list is Napoleon Hill, who nearly 100 years ago connected creative visualization to success. And I will also consider new resources like crowdsourcing. Although I'm a natural skeptic for overhyped internet trends, my friend Elena Kriegner, a talented designer, inspired me with her Kickstarter campaign. It's simple, interesting, and elegant (like her jewelry), which is why it's gaining traction, unlike many others. In this planning exercise, no resources, new or old, are off the table to achieve my desired future.<br /><br />6. Ignore the Naysayers<br />I live for constructive criticism. But outside perspective that is baseless conjecture or stems from emotional baggage (think dissatisfied family or friends) is destructive for achievers. Put these people in a box where they can't distract you from your ambitions. Find people who get it, and put them in your corner. Engage them in your preferred future, and help them achieve theirs.<br /><br />7. Don't Settle for Mediocrity<br />Although being the next Steve Jobs or U.S. president is likely off our agenda (as it should be), J and I both want to be pushed to the limits of our potential. Too many people settle for what is easy rather than engage their energy and creativity to create something different and meaningful. Then they wonder why their work has no significance. I choose to pursue the Awesome Experience.<br /><br />People who take a reactive approach to growth and development will suffer the same fate as companies, managers, and employees who let the markets, technology, and competitors determine their destiny. The game of life rewards aggressive players who leverage their energy, smarts (note that I didn't say intelligence), and creativity to determine and obtain the life that truly makes them happy. As Jim Collins points out in Great by Choice, good and bad luck comes to all; it's how you plan and execute that determines your return on luck.<br /><br />Discussions:<br />1). Do you satisfy your present life? What kind of destiny do you hope for your life?<br />2). From this article, what solutions could you find to deal with fear and failure in your life?<br />3). When you &quot;create your own destiny&quot;, what could you ensure?<br />4). In order to visualize your desired future and make it your reality, how and what effort will you make?<br /><br />=============================================================================================================<br />For the most important seven benefactors in your life, how many ones have you already found?<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.managertoday.com.tw/articles/view/50761">https://www.managertoday.com.tw/articles/view/50761</a><!-- m --><br /><br />There are no more than 90 people in your life who really affect you；Among them, there are no more than 30 people who participate in shaping your world view and value system；Also among them, there are 7 benefactors who will guide you and support you all the way.<br /><br />Li Weiwen, a well-known Chinese-American public relations expert, put forward seven roles to be touched during the growth of each person, and represent seven key forces at different stages in your life.<br /><br />Which of the seven people you have currently found, In fact, will shapes the direction of your life now. In the crucial period of life, choosing the right people and going the right way can create a brand-new starting point for oneself and break through another pattern.<br /><br />The first benefactor : childhood playmate<br />Meet the right people, go the right path, find your childhood playmate!<br />Think about who plays with you and grow up together? Childhood playmate has the power which is still able to affect you after twenty years.<br /><br />The second benefactor : university classmate<br />Student Age - Find Your Enlightener<br />People who really help you are those who you knew in your university time.<br />You have to learn from people who are good at analysis, rather than the best score.<br />At this stage, find a good teacher for yourself and avoid those negative &quot;Enlightenrs.&quot;<br /><br />The third benefactor : colleagues<br />In the first three years after graduation, working with whom every day is very important!<br />The level of colleagues affects our progress.<br />Choose the right industry for you, so that you might be able to meet people who can help you.<br />Let senior colleagues see your efforts and then take the initiative to help you.<br />Find potential shares to become your allies, and together experience the process of growth.<br /><br />The fourth benefactor : department heads<br />Encounter a good boss, better than met a good teacher<br />Whom will you learn from is who will you be.<br />Good boss is more important than good company.<br /><br />The fifth benefactor : business partners<br />Find a reliable partner, and your business could be steady like Taishan<br />There must be two or three long-term partners.<br />Be carefully for the guys who take your nose, and cooperate with those who are upright and stand the trial of profit.<br /><br />The Sixth benefactor : life confidant<br />Listen to the most honest voice, find a good friend<br />A person who can listen to you<br />When encountering difficulties, one can unconditionally reach out for help<br />Who dares to beat you on the table? You need someone who can criticize you!<br /><br />The seventh benefactor : intimate lover<br />Choose a partner is to choose a way of life<br />The partner will change your second half of life, so look for someone who can give you spiritual support for a lifetime.<br />Cultivate yourself to be a &quot;worthy of being loved&quot; person.<br /><br />Do not forget there is the eighth benefactor, the most important thing : to enhance yourself!<br />Strong-willed people make it easier to make good friends.<br />People with good communication skills are more able to communicate with others, to express and convince others.<br />No matter how many people you meet, live in the place you love and do what you love.<br /><br />Questions : <br />(1). How many benefactors have you met in your life? And how do they affect your life<br />2). Have you ever missed your benefactor(s) somehow? And why?<br />3). To become the benefactor of somebody, do you think what could be Give and Get?<br />4). In order to meet these benefactors, what efforts do you have to make?</div>
