<span style="font-weight: bold">Session I: Do women really talk more than men?</span><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4hS4ZL7nY" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4hS4ZL7nY</a><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion questions:</span><br />1.Why people assume women are more talkative than men? Is there any truth to this?<br />2.Why do people have the need to talk so much?<br />3.Do you vent? If you have a long day and you want to release that pressure, what are some ways you guys blow off steam? <br />4.Are you more of a talker or more of a listener?<br />5.What kind of traits that would make you a good talker? or How can one become a good talker? <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Session II: Fake meat debate</span><br />By Barbara Quinn<br /><br />Some refer to it as “cultured” or “cell-based” meat. Others call it “fake” meat. What is it? It’s a new technology to grow meat in the laboratory and it may show up in the meat sections of our supermarkets someday soon.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0080">Cultured meat is meat produced when cells from animals are “cultured” or grown under laboratory conditions. Not to be confused with plant-based meat substitutes made from vegetable proteins, cell-based meat is grown from actual animal cells. So it is an animal product, not a vegetarian option.</span><br /><br />Why do we do need another method to produce meat?<span style="color: #FF0080"> Some say it’s to keep up with the growing demand for quality protein sources in our expanding world. Others say it is an alternate way to produce meat for human consumption.</span><br /><br />Is cell-cultured meat the same as regular meat? Depends on who you talk to. Muscle fibers produced in the laboratory are the same as that found in a steak, say leading researchers in this technology from Maastricht University in The Netherlands. Yet they also say that they need to tweak the procedure to get the same nutrient content, such as iron, that is found in red meat.<br /><br />Are there any concerns with growing meat in the laboratory? Depending on who you listen to,<span style="color: #FF0080"> some groups say this method of meat production would result in less land and water use. Others organizations voice concerns that growing meat in the lab would impact the environment more negatively than our traditional way of raising cattle since it would take massive amounts of energy resources to produce meat in this way.</span><br /><br />Nutritionally, these products would be similar in some nutrients such as protein and different in others. Lastly, what will cultured meat be called? Is it real “meat” or a meat-type product? That remains for either the USDA or FDA or both agencies to decide. For now, we can call it something new on the horizon.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion questions:</span><br />1.What are the benefits of making cultured meat?<br />2.Would you eat lab-grown meat if the price were cheaper? If you are a vegetarian, would you consider eating lab-grown meat?<br />3.Now our world population is over 7.6 billion, what would be a good idea to prepare for a hypothetical “food crisis “? <br />4.Would you consider going vegetarian or flexitarian? Why or why not? If you are vegetarian, what are the pros and cons?<br />5.What is the best meat dish you have ever cooked? Please share the preparation methods or recipe.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Agenda</span><br />7:00 p.m. --7:30 p.m. free talk <br />7:30 p.m. --8:10 p.m. first topic discussion <br />8:10 p.m. --8:20 p.m. Presentation <br />8:20 p.m.-- 8:40 p.m. Sharing time : articles &amp; other experiences. <br />8:40 p.m.-- 9.:15 p.m. second topic discussion <br />9:15 p.m.-- 9:30 p.m. Presentation<br />speaker time : 2 minutes for each speaker<br />host time : 3 minutes<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The meeting place of Thursday:</span><br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第一區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=827">Jason Tang</a> — Thu May 09, 2019 10:34 pm</p><hr />
