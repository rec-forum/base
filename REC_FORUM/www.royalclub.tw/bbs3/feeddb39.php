The new market opened its doors on Oct. 11.<br />On a typical day, about 1,628 tons of seafood passed through Tsukiji, with a value of about 1.6 billion yen (US$14 million). The bustling inner-city market carried about 480 types of seafood and 270 types of other produce.<br />The history of the Tsukiji area could be traced back to 1657, when the government reclaimed land along Tokyo Bay and named it “Tsukiji” — literally translated as “constructed land.” In 1923 the Great Kanto Earthquake destroyed much of central Tokyo, along with the Nihonbashi fish market. In 1935 the market was relocated to its recent site near Ginza, where it transformed the Tsukiji area into a bustling town.<br />The market was one of the top tourist destinations in Tokyo, attracting as many as 42,000 visitors a day. Each year the symbolic New Year auction often attracted media attention, as buyers battled to outbid each other. Bidders used hand signals to dictate their price, with the fish usually selling within seconds.<br />Kiyomura Corp., whose owner Kiyoshi Kimura runs the Sushi Zanmai restaurant chain, was frequently the highest bidder. The most expensive tuna sold at the market went to Kiyomura in 2013 for 155.4 million yen (US$1.36 million).<br />In August 2017, a fire broke out at Tsukiji, burning for 15 hours before it was extinguished, according to media reports. Safety concerns were cited as a key reason to push through the move to a new location.<br />Moving the market proved no easy task. Tokyo Metropolitan Government first decided on the relocation to Tokyo Bay in 2001, but concerns over tainted soil at the new site and the cost of the move led to more than a decade and a half of delays.<br />Tsukiji wasn’t just a place to buy fish. The outer market shops and vendors sold everything from dried foods to kitchenware. Visitors wandered in search of soba and ramen noodle restaurants, and could satisfy a sweet tooth with Japanese confectionery.<br />Not everyone was happy about the move to Toyosu. While some shop owners decided to relocate to the new site, others chose to close down.<br />Question<br />1、Which one do you prefer go shopping at traditional market or at supermarket? Why?<br />2、According to our article, how to make the culture and modern both exist at same time? Do you have any ides?<br />3、When the government makes an important infrastructure, the most difficult thing is how to get all the lord-land agreement. Unfortunately, the fact is all the projects are rejected when the 1% of lord-lands disagree it. What are your opinions when you see the news?<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />How to Stop Being Late Forever <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/69458?ref=translated">https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/69458?ref=translated</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Good morning, John. It's a Friday, and we've got some different perspectives on punctuality. I get to the airport... like a half hour before the flight takes off. I mean, it's Missoula, and I'm usually checked in beforehand anyway and I never check a bag because I change my pants like once a week. That might be too much information, it might be a pro tip. I'm not sure. But in 10 years of doing it this way I've never missed a flight. I have however been late for a lot of things. I am a chronically late person. Sometimes I'm just trying to get that last thing done before I go out the door or I just totally spaced and forgot the thing existed. And I always underestimate how long something is going to take. I don't like this about myself. I understand that me showing up late is seen as a sign of disrespect by people and it is! It is disrespectful. I feel terrible about that because I really respect the people I work with and I value them tremendously but I'm not showing it. This has gotten worse with the book which has a lot of deadlines and a lot of meetings and a lot of signing and signing and signing and signing and signing...yeah. And also ever since Orin was born, I've just had to do a better job of implementing the strategies that I have developed over the last 20 years of being someone who is chronically late. And here are seven of the most important things that I as a chronically late person do to not be that person as much. 1. I let people know when I'm going to be late and I let them know by how much I'm going to be late and I do not lie about that. If I'm gonna be 10 minutes late I don't engage in some sort of miraculous wishful thinking and think &quot;maybe I will get there in five minutes, so I'll say I'm gonna be five minutes late because it'll make it a little less bad right in the moment&quot; and then stretch the bad feeling out a little bit. No, this is terrible. Never do this! 2. Think of the thing that's gonna happen not as the time at which it's going to happen, but as the amount of time until it's going to happen. My deeply irrational brain sees 11:49 and 11:50 as two very different times But it understands that 11 minutes from now is very similar to 10 minutes from now. My phone actually tells me how many minutes something is away rather than at what time it will happen. 3. If it's gonna take six minutes to get somewhere, I need to be driving out of the driveway with six minutes left, not standing up from my desk to go find my computer and wonder where my keys are and then kiss my baby goodbye, so that I get in the car and the meeting has already started. All those things are gonna happen every time. I need to plan for them. 4. Multiple alarms. I have two alarms that go off for every event: one a half an hour before the event and one two minutes before the event. This is especially helpful for things like conference calls because I don't have to go anywhere, I don't have to stand up from my desk. And if a half an hour passes between when I get reminded And when the call is I'm gonna be deep... researching salt mining techniques or something by the time the conference call runs around. I know this about myself so I have that two-minute warning. I just get on the conference call which is maybe number 5. Sometimes I get on the conference call five, even ten minutes before that call starts and just listen to that dope music and do other stuff so that I'm not late when other people show up. 6. Here's a thing about myself: I like to not waste time, and this is part of the problem. And I feel like if I get someplace early that will be a waste of time. But I have mentally shifted myself to realize that if I get someplace early something interesting and useful is going to happen at that place in the same way that it's happening at my desk if I'm not leaving early. And finally number 7, my most important tip: every time you are late, get out your little notes-taking app, whatever it is, And write down why it happened. Diagnose yourself. Understand yourself. Figure this out. So that is both advice and an apology to everyone including you John.<br />Question<br />1.Are you a chronically late person? Why?<br />2.Do you have friends always late? <br />3.Have you ever waited a person for a long time? How long? Did you angry them? <br />4.How can we improve this situation if your friends are chronically late? <br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00-7:30 free talk<br />(Session 1)<br />7:30-7:35 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />7:35~ 8:15 discussion session (40 mins)<br />(Session 2)<br />8:15 ~9:00pm discussion session (45 mins)<br />9:00~9:30 free talk<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=872">Shuman</a> — Wed Oct 17, 2018 4:25 pm</p><hr />
