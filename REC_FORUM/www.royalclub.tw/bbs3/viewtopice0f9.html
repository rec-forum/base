			<div class="content">This Student's Powerful Answer To Bullying<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/52817?ref=translated">https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/52817?ref=translated</a><!-- m --><br /><br />LAURA LING: You had a pretty difficult childhood. Tell me about it. <br />DAVID WANG: Yeah, I was a pretty unhappy kid growing up. I would be afraid of going to school because I would get bullied pretty often, physically and verbally. They would call me like a loser, stupid, skinny, small, retarded. So this was about when I was five years old, right here. I had just moved to a new school, and I had a hard time assimilating and fitting in. <br />LAURA LING: Why were kids bullying you? <br />DAVID WANG: Because I was typically one of the smallest kids and the skinniest kid, the youngest as well. My legs were so skinny that I had to wear braces on them because my quads were so weak. I was really insecure. I just was a really shy kid. I was not confident in myself.<br />LAURA LING: How often would you get bullied? <br />DAVID WANG: Almost on a daily occurrence. There were a couple really vivid incidents that still are in my mind. Once I was pulled back and choked by a bully and strangled and slammed to the ground. And no one really helped me. People around me were actually laughing and ridiculing me. <br />LAURA LING: How did that make you feel? <br />DAVID WANG: When you are bullied, and you're put down, you really feel helpless. I decided to just isolate myself. I would lie in bed at night, and I would think about the knife set downstairs in my kitchen. And I would think OK, if I just took these knives and I, you know, cut myself, I bet no one would care. I didn't know how to control my anger. I didn't have an outlet at all. I mean, one time I punched a wall, broke my hand, and that kind of was an epiphany for me after that. You know, I have to start finding a different kind of outlet or else I'm going to end up hurting myself. <br />LAURA LING: So what did you do? <br />DAVID WANG: So instead of punching things, I started working out in my room. I felt invigorated. I felt really happy and focused. I felt really just alive. <br />LAURA LING: And how has this ritual fitness changed your life? <br />DAVID WANG: So it started with that, working out in my bedroom, but it was really training in the gym that I fell in love with it. And I was actually around other people, so it wasn't like me isolating myself. When I go to the gym, I always take at least 15 minutes to just put in my headphones and visualize what I'm going to do that day. If you're not focused, you're just going through the motions, and that's not going to give you the best results. <br />LAURA LING: When you look in the mirror now, who is the person that you see? DAVID WANG: I see a lot more confident person. I see someone who's made a lot of progress, and most of all I see someone who is on a journey. The gym is symbolic in my life. It's just a haven for me. It's given me my closest friendships. I could even say it's kind of like a sanctuary for me, because it's really therapeutic for me to be there, and I decided to become a trainer and inspire and motivate other people, and I just fell in love with that, as well. <br />LAURA LING: What would you say to that young person who is being bullied and beaten up? <br />DAVID WANG: I think life takes you on a course that sometimes you just don't know what's going to happen. And I personally never would have thought I would be at USC, having a passion for fitness like I do right now. It will make you stronger, and that's what I would say to me 12-year-old self-- to just stay strong and push through it. You will be OK. <br />LAURA LING: Bullying is something that sadly too many people face in life, but I hope you were inspired by David's story of strength and determination.<br /><br />Question:<br />1.	Have you ever been be bullying in anywhere? <br />2.	Are you a helper when you meet someone is be bullying?<br />3.	Have you ever done bullying to someone?<br />4.	How do you think Bullying on the website?<br /><br />Working to Live or Living to Work?<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/56225?ref=translated">https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/56225?ref=translated</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Don't you think it's crazy that so many of us go into work, even when we don't need to be there? Times we could be on the beach buried in sand or traveling the earth, we spend it in the office, traveling from desk to desk, buried in paperwork. See, in this chaotic world, everything goes so fast. We're so busy—seems like everyone's middle name is &quot;Multitask.&quot; But now, now before you go and act all holier-than-thou, how many extra tabs do you have open on your computer right now? See, we all need time to get away from the race, for our family, friends, for the sake of our mental state. Time to rewind, recharge, and reconnect— not reporting to the office on emails that should be on redirect. Because life, ladies and gentlemen, is all about moments. No one in history has ever been able to hold on to one—not a single soul. And you never get them back. See, there one goes! No do over, no rewind, no DVD root menu to skip a previous scene. Ask yourself, How many trips did you almost take? How many sights have you almost seen? How many moments have you lost thinking about the next one? Thinking that once you get this or get there, maybe that will be the best one? Life has taught me that all we will ever have is &quot;now.&quot; But let me be perfectly clear, I'm not saying that quit your job, even though I know you deserve a six-month vacation, twice a year. But how about small steps? Short trips with long dances, no distractions. Spend time with family instead of coworkers, meditation instead of aggravation. Replace our screensavers with sunrises, Palm Pilots with palm trees, jammed copy machines with— man, I really hate jammed copy machines. The most precious thing we have in life are moments. Let's make the most of them before they disappear. Let's see the world while we still can and cherish those while they're still here. Because when our lives are almost over, it won't matter how much money we made, or hours we worked, or times we got Employee of the Month. What we will look back on are the memories we made, the hours we spent with those we loved, and were we Father of the Month, Mother of the Year, Friend of a Lifetime. Holidays should be a time where we go away and come together. From now on, let's take our whole vacation and be fully present— creating memories that will last forever.<br /><br />Question<br />1.	Which is more common in our society right now” work to live or live to work”? Why?<br />2.	Have you ever had a dream but are postponed many times by some excuses? Or you proud of yourself which you did your dreams. Tell us your stories<br />3.	Do you have some tips to share us how to balance work and live? <br />4.	Many of people know about life should be balance. Why do they did not do you think?</div>
