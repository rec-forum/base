			<div class="content">3/23(Sat.) Short bursts of intense exercise 'better for weight loss'/Christchurch shootings: Stories of heroism emerge from attacks(Danny)<br /><br />Article I : Short bursts of intense exercise 'better for weight loss'<br />Link: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-47242940?intlink_from_url=https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c1m99jyd4ggt/weight-loss&amp;link_location=live-reporting-story">https://www.bbc.com/news/health-4724294 ... ting-story</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br />Bursts of high intensity interval training (Hiit) may be more effective for weight loss than longer less intense workouts, a study suggests.<br /><br />The research, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, analysed results from 36 earlier studies.<br /><br />Although all the participants lost weight, those doing Hiit saw a 28.5% greater weight loss.<br /><br />The researchers cautioned that Hiit may not be suitable for everyone.<br /><br />&quot;Hiit might increase the risk of injury and impose higher cardiovascular stress,&quot; they said.<br /><br />What does the study say?<br />Researchers from the Federal University of Goias, Brazil, analysed data from 576 men and 522 women of varying levels of fitness.<br /><br />Interval training was defined as cardiovascular exercise which involved repeated brief bursts of intense effort, interspersed with recovery periods. Cycling, swimming, running and boxing were included.<br /><br />These workouts were compared with longer continuous moderate intensity workouts, most of which were between 30 and 45 minutes. All participants exercised for at least four weeks.<br /><br />Those doing interval training lost on average 1.58kg (3.48lb) compared with the 1.13kg (2.49lb) lost by those doing lower intensity workouts.<br /><br />Sprint interval training seemed to be particularly effective for weight loss, although researchers did caution that the wide variety of training programmes made it difficult to recommend one regime in particular.<br />The NHS currently recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity, such as cycling or brisk walking, every week.<br />'Results impressive'<br />Dr Niels Vollaard, a lecturer in health and exercise science at the University of Stirling, said the results were counterintuitive as most people burned more calories during longer moderate exercise.<br />&quot;There are two possible explanations,&quot; he said.<br />&quot;Firstly, Hiit may lead to greater energy expenditure after exercise - metabolism may be increased for up to a day following a Hiit session.<br />&quot;Secondly, after a Hiit session, you may be less hungry.<br />&quot;In our research, we have shown that appetite hormones are indeed affected.<br />&quot;It is, however, not easy to study whether energy intake is reduced as a result of this in the longer term when following a Hiit routine, so at the moment we are still unsure exactly what the reason is.&quot;<br /><br />Michael Mosley, who was introduced to Hiit seven years ago while making the BBC Horizon documentary The Truth about Exercise, said: &quot;In 2012, I tested three lots of 20-second high intensity workouts on an exercise bike, three times a week.<br />&quot;My insulin sensitivity improved by 24%.<br />&quot;In the programme, we again saw very impressive results with younger, unfit people.<br />&quot;The biggest problem with exercise is compensatory eating and relaxing afterwards.<br />&quot;People go on a treadmill for 30 minutes, burn around 120 calories, then lie around and reward themselves with a muffin.<br />&quot;The theory with Hiit seems to be that it suppresses your appetite and targets the visceral fat in your gut.<br />&quot;It's not the calories you burn that matter - it's what you do next.&quot;<br /><br />Discussion<br />1.	What kind of exercise do you prefer ? Why?( Interval training or longer continuous moderate intensity workouts)<br />2.	Do you have a habit of exercising? Please share your plan.<br />3.	Do you want to try Hiit after this meeting? Why?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Article II : Christchurch shootings: Stories of heroism emerge from attacks<br />Link: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47601516">https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47601516</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br />Stories of heroism have emerged from Friday's attacks at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in which 50 people died and dozens were wounded.<br /><br />A worshipper says he confronted the gunman and threw a credit card reader at him.<br /><br />Two police officers, one of them armed with only a handgun, chased and arrested Brenton Tarrant, 28.<br /><br />The suspect had explosives in his car and was planning more attacks that day, said Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.<br /><br />She has called the killings &quot;an act of terror&quot;. Later on Monday, her cabinet is to discuss changing the country's gun laws.<br /><br />Investigators have been examining the bodies, which are due be returned to relatives for burial by Wednesday.<br />Tributes have been paid for the victims while some 34 people remain in hospital, including a four-year-old girl who is in a critical condition.<br /><br />Afghan-born Abdul Aziz, 48, said he was inside the Linwood mosque, the second target of the attacker, when he heard shouts that someone had opened fire.<br />When he realised the mosque was being attacked, he picked up a credit card machine and ran towards the attacker. He threw the device at the gunman when he returned to his car to pick up another weapon, and ducked between cars as the gunman opened fire on him.<br />Mr Aziz, who was in the mosque with four of his children, picked up a gun that the suspect had dropped and pulled the trigger, but it was empty. He followed the attacker back inside the mosque, where he eventually confronted him again.<br />&quot;When he saw me with the shotgun, he dropped the gun and ran away toward his car. I chased him,&quot; he told Reuters news agency. &quot;He sat in his car and... I threw [the gun] through his window like an arrow. He just swore at me and took off.&quot;<br /><br />Linwood's acting imam Latef Alabi told the Associated Press the death toll would have been far higher at the mosque if Mr Aziz, who said he had not feared the gunman, had not acted.<br />Two rural community police officers who were nearby chased the attacker, blocked his car and captured him. The moment was filmed by a witness, who posted the footage on social media.<br />&quot;[The officers] put New Zealand first,&quot; Ms Ardern said on Saturday, adding that they would be recognised for their bravery.<br /><br />'Too painful'<br />By Jay Savage in Christchurch<br />Nasir Uddin gazes through the trees in the park towards the exterior wall and golden roof of the Al Noor mosque across the road. With a police perimeter still in place, it's as near as he can get. He looks at the building with tear-filled eyes.<br />&quot;Now we are very sad,&quot; he says shakily as he stands in Christchurch's Hagley Park.<br />A migrant from Bangladesh, Mr Uddin, 37, moved to this picturesque city on the east coast of New Zealand's South Island more than five years ago. An Al Noor regular, he would have been at the mosque on Friday if he hadn't had to work.<br />After hearing of the attacks, he began frantically calling people, but no-one answered. He knows at least two of his friends are dead, and is waiting for news on others.<br />&quot;This thing that we feel is too painful.&quot;<br />The gunman first attacked the Al Noor mosque, about 5km (three miles) away, as people had gathered for Friday prayers. The self-described white supremacist live-streamed it on Facebook.<br />The video showed 50-year-old Naeem Rashid, originally from the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, apparently trying to tackle the gunman before being shot. He was taken to hospital but later died.<br /><br />&quot;There were a few witnesses who said he saved a few lives by trying to stop that guy,&quot; his brother Khurshid Alam told the BBC. &quot;It's our pride now, but still the loss. It's like cutting your limb off.&quot;<br />Mr Rashid's 21-year-old son Talha - who had just got a new job and was said to be hoping to get married soon - was also killed. The family had been living in New Zealand since 2010.<br />Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan said Mr Rashid would be honoured posthumously.<br /><br />Also at the Al Noor mosque, 42-year-old Hosne Ara was reportedly in the women's area when she heard gunfire. She was killed while searching for her husband, who uses a wheelchair and survived the attack.<br />Farid Uddin said his wife had helped several women and children escape from the building as the attack unfolded.<br />&quot;We feel proud of what she did. She died in a good cause. She did exactly what she loved and what I loved,&quot; he told the BBC.<br />&quot;I lost my wife but I don't hate the killer. As a person I love him,&quot; he added. &quot;I forgive him... I pray for him.&quot;<br /><br />Police arrived at the mosque - where at least 41 people were killed - six minutes after an emergency call, Police Commissioner Mike Bush said, and the gunman was in custody within 36 minutes.<br />On Tuesday, Parliament will pay a tribute to the victims. Other confirmed victims include:<br />	Kuwait-born Atta Elayyan, 33, who was the goalkeeper for New Zealand's futsal team<br />	Khaled Mustafa, a refugee from the war in Syria<br />	Sayyad Milne, a 14-year-old who wanted to be a footballer when he grew up<br />Brenton Tarrant appeared in court on Saturday in a white prison shirt and handcuffs, smiling for the cameras. He has been charged with one count of murder, with more charges expected to follow.<br />He is the only person charged with carrying out the shootings and is believed to have acted alone, according to Commissioner Bush.<br /><br />Discussion<br />1.	What do you think after you reading the article?<br />2.	What is the main reason for the attack?(Your own opinion)<br />3.	Why Taiwan so safety?<br /><br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:25pm discussion session <br />8:25 ~ 8:30pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:30 ~9:30pm discussion session<br />(Session III)<br />9:30 pm Free talk<br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
