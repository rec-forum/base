The app first became popular in 2017, when it peaked at around 80 million users. In 2019, its popularity jumped again when the FaceApp Challenge became popular. Public figures uploaded photos using the app’s aging filter. It was fun to see how some of the world’s most recognizable people might look when they become old.<br />　　Other filters on the app include ones that change hairstyles, add facial hair, or put on accessories like glasses. There are even filters that can change the sex of a person in a selfie and make it look extremely real.<br />　　FaceApp has had some shady features. A beauty filter on it made people more attractive by lightening the skin of people with naturally dark skin. The app also released ethnic filters that allowed people to change their photos so they looked white, black, Asian, or Indian. All these features were quickly shut down after wide-scale protest, but these were only the beginning of FaceApp’s problems.<br /><br />Discussion<br />Q1:Do you ever try FaceApp?<br />Q2:What do you think Harmless Fun or Security Risk?<br />Q3:How can we use FaceApp in the future?<br /><br /><br />/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////<br /><br />Article 2:Escape to New Adventures<br />Link: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://paper.udn.com/udnpaper/POH0062/347631/web/">https://paper.udn.com/udnpaper/POH0062/347631/web/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />If you’re looking for an exciting challenge, try and see if you can make your way out of an escape room.<br />Do you ever daydream about being on a secret mission or an exciting adventure? If so, escape rooms may be for you. In an escape room, you are locked in a room and have to solve a puzzle or complete a mission before time runs out. There are many different scenarios to try. Sometimes you’ll be rushing to repair a vehicle flying through space. Other times, you’ll be trying to steal valuable art from a museum. Teamwork is usually required, so you’ll have to work with friends or strangers. And you’d better work fast, because most games have to be completed in about one hour.<br />　　Escape rooms have become very popular in recent years. In fact, there are now probably over 10,000 escape rooms around the world! It’s easy to see why they’re a hit. Escape rooms let people feel like they’re a character in an exciting movie or book. Also, they are fun for people of almost any age or background. So, the next time you feel like finding your way out of an Egyptian underground grave, consider an escape room!<br /><br />Discussion<br />Q1:Do you ever play Escape to New Adventures?<br />Q2:How can we learn from Escape to New Adventures?<br />Q3:If you are inventor, how can you create this game?<br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00 ~ 7:30 pm greetings &amp; free talk<br />7:30 ~ 8:15 pm guests introduced &amp; first session discussion<br />8:15 ~ 8:45 pm presentation, sharing the article &amp; other experiences<br />8:45 ~ 9:30 pm second session discussion<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven,<br />板橋民生路二段237 號,<br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30,<br />a minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
