It could be a toxic mother-in-law, a domineering father, a manipulative cousin, or even your own bratty child. But no matter who they are, they know how to push your buttons and just drive you crazy.<br /><br />The bad news is, you can’t get rid of these people completely; they are family. The good news is, learning to deal with difficult people is a considerable advantage in life, and can be valuable in any number of situations. So here are a few things to keep in mind.<br /><br />Questions:<br />1.How can you avoid conflict with a difficult family member？<br />2.What’s your advice on dealing with the family relations？<br />3.Is your place always on your spouse’s side when there is conflict between your family and your spouse？<br />4.How do you build a positive relationship with your in-laws？<br />5.How can you mend a relationship that's turned sour？<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Session II: Advantages and Disadvantages of Euthanasia</span><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.advantages-disadvantages.co/pros-and-cons-of-euthanasia-benefits/">https://www.advantages-disadvantages.co ... -benefits/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The debate on how a person should live or die has been long-standing. Particularly, the debate on the premature ending of life, that is, euthanasia has its complex ethical, moral, religious, and cultural aspects to it. Let us look at the perspectives from both sides.<br /><br />Questions:<br />1.What's your viewpoint regarding euthanasia？<br />2.What are the pros and cons of euthanasia？<br />3.Would Improving palliative care decrease patient requests for physician-assisted suicide?<br />4.Do euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide ensure a good death?<br />5.Is euthanasia acceptable for severely ill infants?<br />6.Do you agree or disagree with euthanasia or mercy killing?</div>
