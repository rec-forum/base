Smartphones alter the way we way walk, talk and think, and we’re barely keeping up.<br />“Everything is available through a Google search almost instantaneously, so what motive do you have to store useless info?” said Joseph LeDoux, who directs New York University’s Emotional Brain Institute.<br />Mr. LeDoux, whose work focuses on how the brain forms memories, said this instant-fact setup clouds our judgment on what information to filter and store. Since we’re no longer weighed down by having to retain trivial data, we are left with greater cognitive space. But how do we select what we remember?<br />He said there are two main kinds of memories: explicit, which are created through conscious experience, and implicit, which form when past experiences affect us, sometimes without our knowledge, as in reacting with fear in dangerous situations or getting sweaty palms when you see a dog if you were once bitten.<br />Memory is a fallible thing, changing over time. Recalling a long-term memory brings it back into our short-term memory, which essentially gives it new context. Memory is therefore a reconstruction, not a photographic recording, and for economic purposes, our brains — unlike computers — are forever rerecording those memories, making them far more error prone.<br />On top of that, we now live inside dual screens and endless browser tabs, headphones streaming music, smartphones buzzing, co-workers chatting with us on Slack — all while we should be performing the actual jobs we’re paid to be doing.<br />“Many people seem unaware that they might accomplish more with sustained, uninterrupted attention to one task,” said Nelson Cowan, a working memory specialist at the University of Missouri. “It can be exhilarating to flit from one conversation to another on Facebook, but people don’t realize what’s missing in the process. It’s like having a delicious soup poured on your head. Often the people who think they’re the best at sharing attention between tasks are actually missing the most.”<br />Mr. LeDoux added: “The brain does have limitations to what it can process or handle.”<br />They’re both right, but there are still things we can do to improve our memories.<br />Repeat After Me<br />As simple as it sounds, the repetition of tasks — reading, or saying words over and over — continues to be the best method for transforming short-term memories into long-term ones. To do that, we have to retrain our minds to focus on one task at a time. Sadly, most bypass this formula because we’re already convinced we’re productive.<br />New connections are made in your brain when you learn. To remember what you learn, do what you probably did in your youth: Repeat words, thoughts and ideas over and over until you get them right. It’s the easiest brain game there is.<br />Take Your Time<br />Forget cramming. It didn’t work in college, it doesn’t work now. Spaced repetition might be the best way.<br />Robert Bjork, the chair of U.C.L.A.’s psychology department, said that quickly stuffing facts into our brains leads us to forget them in the long term (he even filmed a YouTube video series on the subject). When you rehearse knowledge and practice it often, it sticks, research has shown. So if you can incorporate what you’re trying to remember into daily life, ideally over time, your chances of retaining it drastically improve.<br />But once you stop rehearsing that knowledge, the retention drops profoundly. Researchers call this the “forgetting curve.”<br />To get past it, space out your repetition over a few days and test the effect yourself. But be careful: Spacing out sessions or scheduling them too concurrently seem to slow gains, so find a healthy medium that works. This is a good way to effectively start tackling a new language.<br />Sit Down and Stay Put<br />Memory and focus go hand-in-hand. Dr. Cowan suggests rearranging our office setup as one way to improve focus. He believes the collaborative start-up design and open offices touted by Silicon Valley’s hoodied C.E.O.s actually make us far less productive because they create added distractions. How do you stay on task if your co-worker is piloting a drone or endlessly, and loudly, snacking just inches away?<br />“The rebirth of the open workplace cannot be helping this situation,” Dr. Cowan said, alluding to work spaces without desks, physical barriers and privacy, but with a plethora of playthings. Yoga rooms, rock climbing and gardens can be great perks, but they can make it difficult to deliver on deadline with so much stimuli.<br />Multiple studies have found that procrastination leads to stress and downright kills focus. Stop engaging in useless tasks like surfing the web and just tackle whatever it is you need to work on. Then watch your focus soar and your memory improve. Dr. Cowan said both perform better when they aren’t cheating on each other pursuing so-called “life hacks.”<br />Incentivize Moments and Read Cues<br />Minds wander constantly. For students, adding frequent tests incentivizes focus because they know they’ll be quizzed. Harvard researchers report this approach decreases daydreaming by 50 percent, improving the result.<br />Daniel Schacter, a psychologist and a co-author of the Harvard study who also wrote “The Seven Sins Of Memory,” said the trick is focus. For some tasks, like online surfing, divided attention sounds harmless, but when we’re behind the wheel, it’s anything but. That forgetfulness can change the course of entire lives, the most serious vulnerability of memory, he added.<br />Mr. Schacter suggests employing cues — visual or verbal for items like keys — to associate places and things. And our electronic devices can help remind us, everything from mobile vaccination and immunization alerts to apps like Waze that can remind you that you left your baby in the car. It can sound silly, but it’s also tragic when we fail.<br />“Memory is very cue dependent,” he said, referring to something he calls absent-minded memory failure. “Most say it could never happen to me, but it’s a very long list of responsible people that it has happened to. When you don’t have that cue, you can forget almost anything.”<br />He added: “The really tricky thing about absent-minded memory failure is it can affect almost anything if the cue is not present at the moment you need to catch a reaction.”<br />A simple way around that is to set reminders. Even better, combine a few of these techniques: Write your reminder on a Post-it and put it on your desk so you’re forced to repeatedly look at it over a prolonged period, incorporating the practice of spaced repetition. Build on your memory by combining these approaches. Modern life offers few guarantees, but using even one of these tips is surely an improvement.<br />“A lot of people are overconfident that they can handle distractions,” Mr. Schacter said. “Doing two things at once always has an effect. Be aware of the situation you’re in and understand when you let attention divide you, you’re likely to pay the price. In some situations it may not matter, but in others it could change everything.”<br /><br />Discussion:<br />1.	Do you think you could do two things at once and how do you do it?<br />2.	Do you check your phone frequently and how do you avoid being disturbed?<br />3.	Do you know any way could improve your memory?<br />4.	How do you avoid forgetting?<br /> <br />=============================================================================================================<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">In Taiwan, Driverless Bus Trials Seen as Road to Future</span><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20170929/taiwan-autonomous-bus-test/en-us/">https://cn.nytimes.com/china/20170929/t ... est/en-us/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />TAIPEI, Taiwan — Rolling with a barely audible hum beneath banyan trees, a brightly painted shuttle bus cruised through a university campus here.<br />The electric vehicle crawls along no faster than 6 m.p.h. And only 12 passengers can fit inside. But the bus also drives itself — and is raising hopes in Taipei that autonomous public transportation will be up and running here within a year.<br />“The idea of one day being able to ride around this city in driverless vehicles is quite exciting,” said Amber Chen, who was riding with her 8-year-old son Ruey-Shen.<br />The bus tests are partly to prove the technology is safe to deploy on the city’s busy streets, and partly a way of gathering the data needed to improve the artificial intelligence that steers it. As one of the earliest such efforts in Asia, it could help put Taiwan on the map both as a pioneer in autonomous public transportation and, if things go according to plan, as a manufacturer of driverless buses.<br />So far, the bus being tested, called the EZ10, has breezed through its trials on the campus of National Taiwan University, which have been in progress since May.<br />But successful testing on a closed course at low speeds can only reveal so much about how the buses would work in traffic. Getting them on the road at busy times is the next step, and the program’s backers are eager to see that happen quickly.<br />One obstacle: Despite active support from Taipei’s municipal government and its mayor, Ko Wen-Je, the testing has only tacit approval from the central government, said Wei-Bin Lee, commissioner of Taipei’s Department of Information Technology.<br />“The rest of the world isn’t going to stop and wait for you just because you’re sputtering along,” he said.<br />Martin Ting, the general manager of 7StarLake, the Taiwanese company testing the buses, said in an interview that the EZ10 was suited for three scenarios: closed campuses, short, fixed circuits and city bus routes.<br />Such situations abound in Taiwan, which has 23.5 million people and is home to more than 150 universities and colleges, 100-plus industrial parks and 15 theme parks — as well as densely urbanized northern and western coasts. In August, the EZ10 began late-night trials on a short stretch of Xinyi Road, a six-lane artery in downtown Taipei.<br />“Our ultimate goal is to autonomize the entire Xinyi Road main line,” Mr. Ko, the mayor, told local media when starting the trials.<br />The EZ10 is built by the French company EasyMile. It uses GPS and eight laser sensors to navigate predetermined routes. Front and rear cameras enable it to detect and avoid obstacles. At $550,000 a unit, including import taxes, it is nearly twice the price of a larger bus with a driver.<br />Mr. Ting said he aimed to import three more buses next year and begin manufacturing them under license from EasyMile by the end of 2018, with the goal of sourcing half of the components from Taiwanese suppliers. That would eliminate the 45 percent import tax, saving approximately $200,000 per bus.<br />Then EasyMile could look hard at other Asian markets, he said.<br />“After we’ve started supplying Taiwan, we’re going to sell to Japan, Australia, China and South Asia,” he said. “Australia already wants 100 vehicles and Japan has strong demandbefore the 2020 Olympic Games.”<br />The EZ10, with a top speed of 25 m.p.h., achieves “Level 4” automation under the standards of the global engineering association S.A.E. International, meaning its route is chosen by humans but there is no one behind the wheel and it can avoid obstacles on its own. Tesla’s Autopilot system is considered Level 2, although Elon Musk, the company’s chief executive, said this year that the company was only two years away from Level 5: complete autonomy.<br />But for any level of vehicle autonomy to work, urban infrastructure must be updated. For example, traffic lights would require special signals to direct autonomous vehicles.<br />Then there is the issue of creating three-dimensional maps, and the computing power needed to use them for detection and navigation. In a dense, urban environment like Taipei, they must account for the way tall buildings can distort GPS signals.<br />“You need to make a map with 99.999 percent accuracy, which is not easy,” Mr. Ting said. “It takes time and money.”<br />He added that processing all of the data would require cloud computing and a high-speed wireless connection.<br />But technological hurdles aside, national lawmakers in Taiwan have priorities bigger than autonomous vehicles, including a contentious infrastructure package. And politically, many are cautious to embrace even an experimental system, knowing that any accident could derail long-term plans. Nonetheless, the administration of President Tsai Ing-wen has made creating “smart cities,” which include technology like autonomous vehicles, a national priority.<br />“It is time to use our strength in information and communication technology to bolster domestic development,” Ms. Tsai said at a smart city forum in Taipei in February.<br />The legislator Jason Hsu, who visited Silicon Valley with Mr. Ting, said Taiwan could set itself apart, especially in Asia, by focusing on public transportation with Level 4 vehicles. Many countries in the region are involved in autonomous vehicle research and development, including China, Mr. Hsu noted.<br />“The U.S. government is using autonomous vehicles to kick off a whole new industry centered around data-driven platforms,” he said. “The issue in Taiwan is that our legislation is lagging behind.”<br />Mr. Hsu said he would introduce an alliance for smart mobility and autonomous vehicles on Sept. 26 that would help push the central government on the issue.<br />Unlike California, where Mr. Hsu said 36 companies are permitted to put autonomous vehicles on the road, Taiwan has not licensed any companies, including 7StarLake.<br />“The cars are available but we cannot collect data, which is very dangerous as the vehicles need data and experience to fine tune their algorithms and minimize the chance of accident,” he said.<br />Mr. Lee of Taipei’s Department of Information Technology said he hoped Taiwan could turn driverless vehicles into a local industry. That might be enough to keep talented young Taiwanese from heading to China, where at the moment there are more opportunities, he said.<br />“Taiwan is democratic and free. It has its own advantages,” Mr. Lee said.<br /> <br />Discussion:<br />1.	Do you know any automatic technology might cause the human resource demand decrease?<br />2.	What advantage and disadvantage you think is the automatic technology bring in?<br />3.	Do you think what kind of people is easiest effected by the automatic technology and how could we face it?<br />4.	Do you know any policy is relate of the infrastructure and do you think is necessary?</div>
