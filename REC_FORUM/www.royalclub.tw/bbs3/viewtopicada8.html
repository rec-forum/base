It is time for Taiwan to bid adieu to its cheap labor mindset and allow migrant workers to become immigrants.<br />The wage dilemma: Taiwan not competitive <br />Without migrant workers to pick up the slack, Taiwanese society is having trouble functioning, but will reopening the country’s doors to overseas workers automatically solve the problem? <br />Regrettably, the answer is no, largely because the competitive edge Taiwan has had in recruiting migrants is gradually disappearing.<br />One manpower broker said Taiwan had an advantage early on because migrant workers were protected by the Labor Standards Act. That meant they could make the minimum wage and get a raise when the minimum wage went up, leaving them better paid than if they worked in Singapore or Hong Kong, the broker said. <br />But other countries have increased wages for migrant workers in recent years, and now Taiwan’s wages for industrial workers are lower than anywhere else in Asia except for Singapore, and even there Taiwan’s edge is narrowing.<br />The real challenge for Taiwan is coming from Japan and South Korea, which have opened their doors to workers from Southeast Asia.<br />Cheng An-chun (鄭安君), a lecturer at Sagami Women’s University in Japan, said Japan addressed labor shortages in the past by bringing in Chinese nationals as “technical interns” while South Korea turned to ethnic Koreans in China and Russia. <br />But as China has prospered, fewer Chinese need to go abroad to find work, forcing Japan and South Korea to shift their focus to migrant workers from Southeast Asia, Cheng said. <br />The changing focus has dealt a blow to Taiwan, which finds itself increasingly marginalized in the migrant worker labor market because of the relatively high wages paid for industrial work in Japan and South Korea.<br />In Japan, for example, the Chinese “technical interns” that once made up more than 70 percent of its overseas workers now account for less than 20 percent. Japan began allowing in people with specified skill visas in 2019, leading to the recruitment of foreign caregivers. Its top three targets have been Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines, the same countries where Taiwan finds most of its overseas caregivers.<br />“It used to be that when you went to Vietnam to find workers, if you needed 100, 400 candidates would show up. Now, only 90 show up because they would rather go to Japan and South Korea,” said Lee, the manpower agency CEO. <br />The other problem for Taiwan is that fewer Southeast Asian countries are exporting labor as they grow stronger.<br />Thailand is a clear example of that. It is now supporting the development of its own industrial sector by providing no-interest loans to workers, but at one point it was the main source of labor for Taiwan’s public infrastructure projects, peaking at 140,000 workers. Today, fewer than 60,000 Thai workers remain.<br /><br />Question <br />1.	What is your impression of migrants? (including white and blue collar)<br />2.	Do you agree equal work, equal paid between native workers and foreigners? Why?<br />3.	According to the current news, there are more than 50,000 foreigners’ workers escape, what cause to this problem?<br />4.	Would you like to become a migrant?<br />5. Do you think Taiwanese are friend for migrants?<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />The 10 Best Taiwanese Movies of 2021<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.cinemaescapist.com/2021/12/best-taiwanese-movies-2021/">https://www.cinemaescapist.com/2021/12/ ... vies-2021/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Question<br />1.
