Types of Power plants (發電廠種類)<br /> - Coal-fired power plant/unit (燃煤機電廠/機組)<br /> - Gas-fired power plant/unit (燃氣電廠/機組)<br /> - Nuclear power plant/unit (核能電廠/機組)<br /> - Renewable Energy 〔再生能源，including Hydropower (水力), wind power(風力), photovoltaic power(PV, 太陽光電)，Geothermal(地熱), etc.〕<br /><br />B. Units of Power Generation capacity (發電容量單位)<br /> - kilowatt (KW)：千瓦(瓩)<br /> - 1Megawatt (MW)=1000KW<br /> - 1萬瓩=10MW (e.g.36,266,000 kilowatts =36,266MW=3,626.6萬瓩)<br /> - 1Gigawatt(GW)=1000MW<br /><br />C. Definition of Operation Reserve and Percent Operation Reserve<br /> - Operating Reserve(備轉容量)：<br />   指當天實際可調度之發電容量裕度，亦即系統每天的供電餘裕。<br />   ＝系統運轉淨尖峰能力－系統瞬時尖峰負載(瞬間值)。 <br /> - Percent Operating Reserve(備轉容量率)：係用來衡量每日供電可靠度之指標。<br />  ＝（系統運轉淨尖峰供電能力－系統瞬時尖峰負載(瞬間值)）÷系統瞬時尖峰負載(瞬間值)×100%。<br />- Peak Operation Capacity (系統運轉淨尖峰供電能力)：扣除歲修(機組大修)、小修(機組檢修)及故障機組容量、火力機組環保限制、輔機故障、氣溫變化、水力考慮水位、水文、灌溉及溢流等。<br /><br />D.

Recent Development on Taiwan’s power supply issues and Taiwan’s Energy transformation in the future:<br /> - The hot weather and Taiwan's electricity reserves were cut when a transmission tower operated by independent power producer Ho-Ping Power Co. (和平電力) was blown to the ground by Typhoon Nesat on July 29.<br /> - To cope with a tighter power supply in the interim, the Cabinet called for air conditioners in public buildings to be turned off between the peak consumption hours of 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. starting on July 31. But that limitation was lifted on Aug. 10.<br /> - 2017/8/9中央大學管理講座教授、中研院經濟所兼任研究員梁啟源,於經濟日報發表文章「限電與核電的抉擇…」，摘要如下：<br /> - 政府面臨決定性的選擇，是要重啟核一廠1號機、核二廠2號機？還是要冒限電的風險？現在供電已走在鋼索上，一旦限電，台灣可能面臨產業出走的危機，遑論要留住台積電的新投資。用電安全是國安議題。<br /><br /> - 供電規畫不是剛好符合當下需求就行，還得預留成長的空間，以備民間投資所需。重啟核一廠1號機、核二廠2號機圖的不僅是未來一、兩周，因為缺電危機會延續到明年，重啟至少可確保明年的供電。不重啟，難不成叫明年用電不成長？經濟不成長？<br /><br /> - 而重啟核一廠1號機、核二廠2號機屬行政權，是行政部門該做的決定。這兩部機組歲修後，已得原能會重啟的許可，之前被指責的各項缺失都已改善。只要行政部門一聲令下，即可運轉。<br /><br />- 外界以為是立法院卡關，的確，立法院—而且是上一屆的立法委員做了要求，要求行政部門要向立法院報告後才可以重啟，但重啟既是行政權，行政部門有權逕行決定。<br /><br />* 2017/8/8民眾於國發會公共政策網路參與平台提案「啟動核一、核四 ，並以核能發電盈餘發展綠色能源」，截至昨（8/11）日短短三天，連署已衝破5,000人的成案門檻，警示政府應正視當前缺電危機。昨日用電量再創歷史新高，也亮出今年第三顆供電紅燈，民眾關切限電危機。(8/12經濟日報)<br /><br />* 2017/8/11工商協進會理事長林伯豐率領20位理監事，赴總統府晉見蔡英文總統。林伯豐會後表示，他提出重啟核電的建議，在供電緊俏的現在，不該刻意閒置核一廠、核二廠的兩座發電機組，如果再限電，只會加速企業外移。(8/12經濟日報)<br /><br />* 2017/8/11總統府發新聞稿表示：蔡總統在致詞時強調，政府會用盡所有方式確保供電穩定，而核四確實不會是台灣的選項，「現在不是，未來也不是。」她指出，所有核電機組在2025年將如期退役，而台灣好不容易在修正電業法後走到現在這一步，「不容許一個意外就放棄非核家園的目標」。<br /><br />G. 2016年(105年)台電系統發購電量占比<br />105 年台電系統發購電量為2,257.92億度，其中火力發電量占比達79.9%，其中燃煤36.9%、燃油4.4%、燃氣36%、汽電共生2.6% (不含垃圾及沼氣)，再生能源占比為5.1% (含水力及汽電共生中之垃圾及沼氣)，抽蓄水力1.5%，核能為13.5%。(台電網站)<br /><br />F. 政府推重能源轉型配比 (2017/5/17聯合報)<br /><div class="inline-attachment">

			</div><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion:</span><br />1. Do you agree that the air conditioners in public buildings to be turned off between the peak power consumption hours of 1 p.m. to 3 p.m when facing tighter power supply?<br />2. Do you agree that unit 1 of First Nuclear Power Plant and unit 2 of Second Nuclear Power plant, which have been approved by the Atomic Energy Committee (原子能委員) for operation but now sit idled, to restart to relieve the tighter power supply in Taiwan?<br />3. What kind of impacts will be if Taiwan faces power shortage?<br />4. Our government have set the goal to achieve the nuclear-free homeland (非核家園) by 2025. For the energy transform process, the energy mix will be set : 50% gas (LNG), 30% coal, and 20% renewable energy by 2025. Do you have any opinion on that?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Session 2--Samsung Heiress Ordered to Pay $7.6 M in Divorce Ruling </span><br />July 20, 2017, at 3:42 a.m. <br /><a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2017-07-20/samsung-heiress-ordered-to" class="postlink">https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2017-07-20/samsung-heiress-ordered-to</a><br /><br />SEOUL (Reuters) - A Seoul court on Thursday ordered Samsung Group heiress Lee Boo-jin to provide assets of 8.6 billion won ($7.64 million) to her estranged husband in a divorce from the ex-employee of a Samsung affiliate.<br />Lee, the 46-year-old chief executive of Hotel Shilla and daughter of ailing Samsung Group patriarch Lee Kun-hee, received sole custody of their son in the ruling, a spokeswoman for the Seoul family court told Reuters.<br />If appealed within two weeks, however, the ruling is not final, the spokeswoman added.<br /><br />Im Woo-jae, 48, was dubbed &quot;Mr. Cinderella&quot; by media for his humble background before marrying Lee in 1999. But in late 2014, she filed for divorce and custody of their child.<br />Im, who filed his own suit seeking 1.2 trillion won ($1.1 billion) from Lee through a division of assets, plans to appeal against Thursday's ruling, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency said, citing one of his lawyers.<br /><br />Reuters could not immediately reach Im's lawyers, or a representative of Lee, to seek comment.<br />An employee of a security service affiliate of Samsung Group who did not belong to the political or business elite, Im was seen as an unusual match for a member of a family controlling South Korea's most powerful business conglomerate.<br /><br />South Korean media have said the couple, who met at a volunteering event, had to overcome opposition from both families in order to marry.<br />Im took an MBA from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology after marrying Lee and rose quickly through the ranks at Samsung, becoming an executive vice president at Samsung Electro-Mechanics.<br /><br />Forbes estimates Lee's net worth at $2 billion, chiefly from the market value of her stake of 5.5 percent in Samsung's de-facto holding company, Samsung C&amp;T Corp.<br />Samsung Electronics vice chairman Jay Y. Lee has been effectively running the conglomerate after the elder Lee was incapacitated in a 2014 heart attack. Jay Y. Lee is now in jail during a trial on bribery charges he has denied.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion:</span><br />1. Do you think that the court’s ruling that Lee Boo-jin (李富真) to provide assets of $7.64 million (about N.T. 230m) to her estranged husband in a divorce is fair? Or her husband’s appeal to seek $1.1 billion (about N.T. 3,300 million) from Lee through a division of assets is fair?<br />2. Im Woo-jae was dubbed &quot;Mr. Cinderella&quot; by media for his humble background before marrying Lee in 1999. However, after marriage, Im got a lot of pressure and committed suicide twice. That means Mr. Cinderella did lived happily ever after with the Samsung princess. What can we learn from this story?<br />3. According to the article, Im Woo-jae (任佑宰) was seen as an unusual match for a member of a family controlling South Korea's most powerful business conglomerate. Do you think that properly-matched marriage (門當戶對的婚姻) is very important even in the modern society?<br />4. Who do you think is the victim of this marriage?</div>
