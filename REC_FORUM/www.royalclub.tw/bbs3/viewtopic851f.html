			<div class="content"><span style="color: #FF0000">Thursday gathering of Royal Club is relocated to Ikari 怡客咖啡, 台北市衡陽路116號</span><br /><br />Session 1: Taiwan to ease limits on US pork and beef<br /><br />President Tsai Ing-wen yesterday announced that Taiwan would ease restrictions on US beef and pork imports, while setting standards for pork containing ractopamine, in an apparent attempt to clear obstacle to free-trade talks with Washington.<br />“This is a decision that was made based on national economic interests and is in line with future comprehensive strategic objectives,” Tsai told a news conference at the Presidential Office in Taipei.<br /><br />Despite her Democratic Progressive Party’s long insistence on a “zero tolerance” policy toward ractopamine, Tsai said she has instructed government agencies to set a “safe tolerance” level for the leanness-enhancing drug in imported pork, based on scientific evidence and international standards, on the condition that the public’s health is protected.<br />Later yesterday at a news conference at the Executive Yuan, officials said the policy, scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1, would have a limited effect on consumers and the nation’s pig farming industry.<br /><br />The decision to lift the bans on US pork containing ractopamine and beef from cattle more than 30 months old is aimed at facilitating efforts to expand Taiwan’s international trade, officials said.<br />Matching international standards and deepening trade ties have been central to the nation’s economic strategies, and the nation’s economic success can be attributed to it complying with international trade practices and regulations, Minister Without Portfolio John Deng (鄧振中) said.<br />Washington has for nearly a decade criticized Taipei as an “unreliable trade partner,” because it had failed to set a legal standard for the amount of ractopamine permitted in pork imported from the US, which has hampered US pork exports to the nation, he said.<br /><br />On whether lifting the ban would lead to concrete economic progress — such as the signing of the Taiwan-US Trade and Investment Framework Agreement — Deng said Washington is not looking for a quid pro quo exchange, but is seeking to remove trade obstacles.<br />The US views Taiwan as an important trade partner, and he believed the US would soon take action to bolster bilateral ties, he added.<br /><br />More nations have in the past few years allowed the import of meat products, including Japan and South Korea, who are Taiwan’s main trade competitors, and nine other member states of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Mei-hua (王美花) said.<br />Without lifting the ractopamine ban, the nation would be unable to make progress on free trade agreements and regional economic integration deals, she said.<br /><br />Council of Agriculture Minister Chen Chi-chung (陳吉仲) said that Taiwanese consume about 900,000 tonnes of pork each year, 91 percent of which is locally produced, while US pork accounts for about 1 percent.<br />Only about 20 percent of pig farmers in the US still use ractopamine, he said, adding that Taiwanese can always not buy US pork.<br />The new policy would not have a significant effect on the nation’s eating habits or hog industry, he said.<br />Minister of Health and Welfare Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) said the ministry yesterday finalized a rule that would require the country of origin of individually packaged pork products and pork sold at restaurants to be clearly labeled.<br /><br />Vendors who do not label the origin of their pork products could face a fine of up to NT$3 million (US$101,622), and those who use false labels could be fined up to NT$4 million, he said.<br />The Food and Drug Administration would use the Codex Alimentarius Commission’s maximum ractopamine residue limit of 10 parts per billion in pork and beef as a reference, and set a maximum permissible value in imported US pork that reflects the eating habits of Taiwanese, he said.<br /><br />The government’s commitment to safeguarding public health would not be affected by the lifting of the import ban, he added.<br />The American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei yesterday in a statement welcomed the decision, saying it would help Taiwan and the US to make progress in starting negotiations for a bilateral trade agreement.<br /><br />Questions:<br />1.Should people worry about imports of US pork containing the additive ractopamine?<br />2.How do people prevent eating US pork from getting chronic disease ?<br />3.How are pig farmers affected by this decision?<br />4.Will Taiwan and US reach the bilateral free-trade agreements (FTAs) soon?<br />5.Does government need to submit its decision to the Legislative Yuan for review?<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Session 2: Simple ways to save money<br /><br />Sometimes the hardest thing about saving money is just getting started. This step-by-step guide for how to save money can help you develop a simple and realistic strategy, so you can save for all your short- and long-term savings goals.<br /><br />1.Record your expenses<br />The first step to start saving money is to figure out how much you spend. Keep track of all your expenses—that means every coffee, household item and cash tip.<br />Once you have your data, organize the numbers by categories, such as gas, groceries and mortgage, and total each amount. Use your credit card and bank statements to make sure you’re accurate—and don’t forget any.<br />Tip: Look for a free spending tracker to help you get started. Choosing a digital program or app can help automate some of this work. Bank of America clients can use the Spending &amp; Budgeting tool, which automatically categorizes your transactions for easier budgeting in the mobile app or online.<br /><br />2.Budget for savings<br />Once you have an idea of what you spend in a month, you can begin to organize your recorded expenses into a workable budget. Your budget should outline how your expenses measure up to your income—so you can plan your spending and limit overspending. Be sure to factor in expenses that occur regularly but not every month, such as car maintenance.<br />Tip: Include a savings category—aim to save 10 to 15 percent of your income.<br /><br />3.Find ways you can cut your spending<br />If your expenses are so high that you can’t save as much as you’d like, it might be time to cut back. Identify nonessentials that you can spend less on, such as entertainment and dining out. Look for ways to save on your fixed monthly expenses like television and your cell phone, too.<br />Here are some ideas for trimming everyday expenses:<br />• Use resources such as community event listings to find free or low-cost events to reduce entertainment spending.<br />• Cancel subscriptions and memberships you don’t use—especially if they renew automatically.<br />• Commit to eating out only once a month and trying places that fall into the “cheap eats” category.<br />• Give yourself a “cooling off period”: When tempted by a nonessential purchase, wait a few days. You may be glad you passed—or ready to save up for it.<br /><br />4.Set savings goals<br />One of the best ways to save money is to set a goal. Start by thinking of what you might want to save for—perhaps you’re getting married, planning a vacation or saving for retirement. Then figure out how much money you’ll need and how long it might take you to save it.<br /><br />Here are some examples of short- and long-term goals:<br /><br />Short-term (1–3 years)<br />• Emergency fund (3–9 months of living expenses, just in case)<br />• Vacation<br />• Down payment for a car<br /><br />Long-term (4+ years)<br />• Down payment on a home or a remodeling project<br />• Your child’s education<br />• Retirement<br /><br />If you’re saving for retirement or your child’s education, consider putting that money into an investment account such as an IRA or 529 plan. While investments come with risks and can lose money, they also create the opportunity for growth when the market grows, and could be appropriate if you plan for an event far in advance. See step No. 6 for more details.<br />Tip: Set a small, achievable short-term goal for something fun and big enough that you aren’t likely to have the cash on hand to pay for it, such as a new smartphone or holiday gifts. Reaching smaller goals—and enjoying the fun reward you’ve saved for—can give you a psychological boost that makes the payoff of saving more immediate and reinforces the habit.<br /><br />5.Decide on your priorities<br />After your expenses and income, your goals are likely to have the biggest impact on how you allocate your savings. Be sure to remember long-term goals—it’s important that planning for retirement doesn’t take a back seat to shorter-term needs.<br />Tip: Learn how to prioritize your savings goals so you have a clear idea of where to start saving. For example, if you know you’re going to need to replace your car in the near future, you could start putting money away for one now.<br /><br />6.Pick the right tools<br />If you’re saving for short-term goals, consider using these FDIC-insured deposit accounts:<br />• Savings account<br />• Certificate of deposit (CD), which locks in your money for a fixed period of time at a rate that is typically higher than savings accounts<br />For long-term goals consider:<br />• FDIC-insured individual retirement accounts (IRAs), which are tax-efficient savings accounts<br />• Securities, such as stocks or mutual funds. These investment products are available through investment accounts with a broker-dealer. Remember that securities are not insured by the FDIC, are not deposits or other obligations of a bank and are not guaranteed by a bank. They are subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of your principal.<br />Tip: You don’t have to pick just one account. Look carefully at all of your options and consider things like balance minimums, fees and interest rates so you can choose the mix that will help you best save for your goals.<br /><br />7.Make saving automatic<br />Almost all banks offer automated transfers between your checking and savings accounts. You can choose when, how much and where to transfer money or even split your direct deposit so a portion of every paycheck goes directly into your savings account.<br />Tip: Splitting your direct deposit and setting up automated transfers are simple ways to save money since you don’t have to think about it, and it generally reduces the temptation to spend the money instead. With Mobile &amp; Online Banking, Bank of America clients can easily set up automatic transfers between accounts.<br /><br />8.Watch your savings grow<br />Review your budget and check your progress every month. Not only will this help you stick to your personal savings plan, but it also helps you identify and fix problems quickly. Understanding how to save money may even inspire you to find more ways to save and hit your goals faster.<br /><br />Questions:<br />1.Do you save money or live from paycheck to paycheck ?<br />2.How many ways do you use to save money in the article?<br />3.Do you have your own ways to save money other than the ways in the article?<br />4.Regarding spending less or making more money, do you think which one will be the fast way to achieve financially independent?<br />5.If you are a money saver, but your children are not, how do you deal money issue with them?<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00 pm-7:30 pm Free talk<br />7:30 pm-8:10 pm Session 1 discussion<br />8:10 pm-8:40 pm Presentation (At least two members of each table are invited)<br />8:40 pm-8:45 pm Break time &amp; Group picture<br />8:45 pm-9:15 pm Session 2 discussion<br />9:15 pm-9:30 pm Presentation<br /><br />P.S.<br />1.因聚會地點是在咖啡店內，所以有低消80元喔。<br />2.參加三次後，只要繳交500元，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />3.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~</div>
