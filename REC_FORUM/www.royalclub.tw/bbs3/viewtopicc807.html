The Microsoft co-founder encourages the gift of reading with these five titles, which range from a memoir about the power of education to a guide to facing modern-day fears.<br />In a post detailing his picks on Gates Notes, the philanthropist acknowledges that he normally does not consider the “giftable” nature of a book, but his selections for 2018 can truly satisfy any reader. “If you’re looking for a fool-proof gift for your friends and family, you can’t go wrong with one of these,” he writes. Here, the five books Gates loved in 2018.<br />Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup, John Carreyrou<br />This page-turner was one Gates called “so compelling he couldn’t turn away.” Bad Blood delves into the collapse of Theranos, a company that claimed it could take a small sample of a customer’s blood and test for an overall picture of health — but the technology behind the tests never actually worked. “The story is even crazier than I expected, and I found myself unable to put it down once I started,” Gates writes. “This book has everything: elaborate scams, corporate intrigue, magazine cover stories, ruined family relationships and the demise of a company once valued at nearly $10 billion.”<br />Army of None: Autonomous Weapons and the Future of War, Paul Scharre<br />Scharre, a former Army Ranger, outlines the scope of autonomous weapons and the power of technologies like artificial intelligence. “Autonomous weapons aren’t exactly top of mind for most around the holidays, but this thought-provoking look at A.I. in warfare is hard to put down,” Gates writes. “It’s an immensely complicated topic, but Scharre offers clear explanations and presents both the pros and cons of machine-driven warfare.”<br /><br />21 Lessons for the 21st Century, Yuval Noah Harari<br />If the anxieties of 2018 are getting to you, historian Yuval Noah Harari offers some relief: We shouldn’t forgo worrying altogether, we just need to worry in a more organized way. “It’s to know which things to worry about, and how much to worry about them,” Gates writes. Harari has “teed up a crucial global conversation about how to take on the problems of the 21st century.”<br /><br />Educated: A Memoir, Tara Westover<br />Tara Westover grew up with survivalist parents who kept her completely isolated from the outside world — she didn’t attend school until she was 17 — but she taught herself everything she needed to know to go to college, eventually earning a Ph.D. from Cambridge University. The only memoir on Gates’ list, Educated highlights the importance of self-reinvention, but never at the cost of Westover’s childhood. “Tara is never cruel, even when she’s writing about some of her father’s most fringe beliefs,” Gates writes. “It’s clear that her whole family, including her mom and dad, is energetic and talented. Whatever their ideas are, they pursue them.”<br />The Headspace Guide to Meditation &amp; Mindfulness, Andy Puddicombe<br />Gates jokes that his 25-year-old self would “scoff” at his selection of this book about meditation, but he now sees that “meditation is simply exercise for the mind, similar to the way we exercise our muscles when we play sports.” Gates notes that he found many books about meditation to be too intimidating, but Puddicombe “made the barrier to entry low enough” both with his Headspace app and this how-to book. “Andy’s a witty storyteller and offers lots of helpful metaphors to explain potentially tricky concepts, which makes the book an easy, enjoyable read,” Gates writes. He and wife Melinda Gates practice meditation and invited Puddicombe to walk their family through exercises. They found him “just as warm, humble, and real as we’d imagined from reading his book and listening to him on the app.”<br /><br />Question<br />1.	What kind of book do you prefer?<br />2.	After gradating, people read a book seldom and stop to learn. Why?  How often do you read the book?<br />3.	Do you have a list of books that you can share to us? How interesting?<br /><br /><br />How to Tell If Someone Is Lying to You, According to Body Language Experts<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://time.com/5443204/signs-lying-body-language-experts/?utm_campaign=time&amp;utm_source=line_app&amp;utm_medium=social">http://time.com/5443204/signs-lying-bod ... ium=social</a><!-- m --><br /><br />there are signals that vetted body language experts suggest keeping an eye out for.<br />Body Cues<br />The hands: Liars tend to use gestures with their hands after they speak as opposed to during or before a conversation, says Traci Brown, who has participated in a deception training program with members of the FBI and occasionally helps work on investigations. “The mind is doing too many things including making up the story, figuring out if they’re being believed and adding to the story accordingly,” she says. “So normal gesturing that might normally happen just before a statement happens after the statement.”<br />A 2015 study conducted by the University of Michigan looked at 120 media clips of high-stakes court cases in order to understand how people behave when lying versus when they’re being truthful. The study found that those who lie are more likely to gesture with both of their hands than those who are telling the truth — people gestured with both of their hands in 40% of the lying clips, compared to 25% of the truthful clips.<br />When people are being dishonest, they also tend to face their palms away from you, says Traci Brown, who regularly gives keynote speeches at financial institutions to help them detect and prevent fraud. It’s an unconscious signal that they’re holding back information, emotions or even lying, she says. “They may put them in their pockets or even slide them under the table.”<br />Itching and fidgeting: Rocking the body back and forth, cocking the head to the side or shuffling the feet can also be signs of deception, says Glass, who completed a post-doctoral fellowship at UCLA focusing on Psychology and Verbal and Non-Verbal Communication. Fluctuations in the autonomic nervous system, which regulates bodily functions, can also have an effect, she says. When people are nervous, these fluctuations in the nervous system can prompt people to feel itches or tingles in their body, which in turn can cause more fidgeting, she explains.<br />Research conducted by UCLA psychology professor R. Edward Geiselman drew a similar conclusion, finding that people tend to display “grooming behaviors,” such as playing with their hair, when being dishonest.<br />Facial Cues<br />The eyes: Someone who is lying might stare or look away at a crucial moment, says Glass — a possible sign they’re moving their eyes around as they try to think about what to say next. <br />The research conducted by Geiselman at UCLA corroborated this, finding that people sometimes look away briefly when lying. The 2015 study conducted by the University of Michigan also found that those who lied were more likely to stare than those who were truthful — so much so that 70% of the clips of people lying showed them staring directly at the people they were lying to.<br />There is still some debate over this, however. A 2012 study published in Plos One debunked the concept that people look in a specific direction when they are dishonest. And while there is a possibility of reading too much into someone’s mannerisms, Glass maintains that there is some truth to be gleamed from the eyes.<br />The mouth: Rolling the lips back to the point where they almost disappear could be a sign someone is lying by omission, according to Traci Brown. “It’s been my experience that, when people do that, they’re holding back emotions or facts,” she says. <br />The research conducted at UCLA found that people who lie are more likely to purse their lips when asked sensitive questions. Pursing the lips could also mean someone doesn’t want to engage in the conversation at hand, says Glass. “It’s an instinctive reflex meaning you don’t want to speak,” she says.<br />Change in complexion: Ever notice someone go white as a ghost when speaking? That could be a sign of untruthfulness, says Glass, who says this signals blood rushing out of the face.<br />Sweating or dryness: Autonomic nervous system changes can trigger liars to sweat in the T-area of the face (upper lip, forehead, chin and around the mouth) or have dryness in the mouth and eyes — the person might excessively blink or squint, lick or bite their lips or swallow hard, according to Glass.<br />Tone of Voice<br />A high-pitched voice: When people are nervous, the muscles in the vocal cords might tighten up (an instinctive response to stress), leading the voice to sound very high-pitched, says Glass. You might also notice a creak in someone’s voice. Clearing the throat, a means of coping with the discomfort of the tightened muscles, can also at times signal dishonesty, she says.<br />Content of Speech<br />Phrases such as ‘I want to be honest with you,’ ‘honestly’ or ‘let me tell you the truth’: These can be signs someone may be trying a little too hard to convince you of their honesty, according to Glass. <br />Using words such as, ‘uh,’ ‘like’ and ‘um’: The research conducted at the University of Michigan found “speaking with more vocal fill” to be a common indicator of deception. Glass says that people tend to use these words more when they’re trying to buy time to figure out what they’re going to say next. <br />Slip-ups: Most of us are not natural-born liars, Glass notes. So sometimes, we let the truth slip out. Notice someone saying things like, “I was fired — no, wait, I mean I quit” or “I was out to dinner with So-and-So — wait actually, I was working late.” You might have a liar on your hands, she says.<br />Question<br />1.	Do you believe the article say?<br />2.	Why people don’t tell the truth all the time? <br />3.	What kind of situation you will tell a lie?<br />4.	What did you do when you find your friends lie to you?<br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00-7:30 free talk<br />(Session 1)<br />7:30-7:35 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />7:35~ 8:15 discussion session (40 mins)<br />(Session 2)<br />8:15 ~9:00pm discussion session (45 mins)<br />9:00~9:30 free talk<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
