Eight new restaurants receive Michelin stars<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2020/08/25/2003742259?utm_medium=P">https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan ... m_medium=P</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Eight restaurants in Taipei and Taichung were given one or two-star Michelin ratings for the first time, while Le Palais of the Palais de Chine Hotel retained its three-star rating for the third consecutive year in this year’s Michelin Guide. Michelin began evaluating the culinary scene in Taipei in 2018. This year was the first time that it evaluated restaurants in Taichung, too. The list of star-rated restaurateurs was revealed in a ceremony at the National Taichung Theater yesterday.<br /><br />In Taipei, Danny’s Steakhouse (教父牛排), Da-Wan Yakiniku Dining Restaurant (大腕燒肉), Golden Formosa Restaurant (金蓬萊遵古台菜), Impromptu by Paul Lee, Ken Anho Japanese Restaurant (謙安和), Kitcho Sushi Restaurant (吉兆割烹壽司), L’Atelier de Joel Rebuchon (侯布雄), Longtail Restaurant and Bar, Ming Fu Taiwanese Seafood Restaurant (明福台菜海鮮), Mountain &amp; Sea House Restaurant (山海樓), Mume, Sushi Nomura (鮨野村), Sushi Ryu (鮨隆), Three Coins Cantonese Restaurant (大三元酒樓), Tien Hsiang Lo Restaurant (天香樓) of the Landis Hotel Group and Ya Ge Restaurant (雅閣) of Mandarin Oriental Hotel maintained their one-star ratings.<br /><br />The six restaurants that received a one-star rating for the first time were Taipei’s A Cut of the Ambassador Hotel Group, Molino de Urdanize of Hotel MVSA (渥達尼斯磨坊) and Sushi Akira (明壽司), and Taichung’s Fleur de Sel Restaurant (鹽之華), Forchetta Restaurant and Oretachi No Nikuya (俺達的肉屋). Five restaurants maintained their two-star ratings: RAW, Nihonryori RyuGin (祥雲龍吟), Sushi Amamoto (鮨天本), Tairroir (態芮) and Guest House (請客樓) of the Sheraton Grand Taipei Hotel.<br /><br />Two restaurants featuring Asian cuisine — JL Studio in Taichung and Logy in Taipei — secured a two-star rating for the first time. Le Palais, which features baked egg custard tarts, Cantonese-style crispy roast duck and tofu dishes was awarded three stars by the Michelin Guide for a third time. Chung Chia-hsien (鍾佳憲), who works at Oretachi No Nikuya, also won the Michelin Young Chef Award, a new award category.<br /><br />“Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, gourmet enthusiasts have to undergo many restrictions when dining out,” Michelin Taiwan general manager Jay Mao (毛行健) said. “Chefs and restaurant owners also face unprecedented challenges, but they continue to use creativity to serve gourmet lovers by offering online culinary courses.”<br /><br />It is because of this difficult situation that announcement of the new Michelin Guide is “even more precious,” Mao said. The culinary scene in Taiwan has been voted by international visitors as the No. 1 reason the nation is worth visiting, Minister of Transportation and Communications Lin Chia-lung (林佳龍) said. The publication of the new guide, featuring restaurants in Taichung, “shows that Taiwan has other attractive and multicultural cities, aside from the capital,” Lin said. “Taipei has solidified its status as the city for gourmet lovers through recognition from the Michelin Guide in the past three years, and I hope that the same thing will also happen with Taichung, a city with many restaurants serving creative dishes,” he said. <br />“I strongly recommend that the Michelin Guide consider evaluating the culinary scenes in southern Taiwan, such as Kaohsiung and Tainan,” Lin added.<br /><br />Questions:<br />1.Which kind of food do you like the most? Chinese, Taiwanese, Japanese or western kind of foods? Why?<br />2.Do you have any idea what qualifies a restaurant for a Michelin star? Have you ever tried Michelin-starred restaurants in Taiwan? If yes, is it worth trying? If not, are you interested in visiting one?<br />3.In addition to Taipei’s high-class Michelin-starred restaurants, 24 night market stalls were awarded the Bib Gourmand distinction, an honor that signifies “good quality, good value cooking” for eateries offering a three course meal not exceeding NT$1,000. Are you interested in trying it? How do you like street foods in Taiwan? What’s your favorite street foods?<br />4.From your point of view, what are some qualities or characteristics that make a good restaurant? Do you have any recommendation for must eat places in Taipei? What makes them special?<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Session 2. Dealing with Culture Shock: Real Tips from Real Travelers<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.goabroad.com/articles/dealing-with-culture-shock">https://www.goabroad.com/articles/deali ... ture-shock</a><!-- m --><br /><br />It is a truth universally acknowledged that any traveler will, at some point, experience the culture shock stages.”<br />You’ve maybe read about it, you might have been warned at your travel program pre-departure orientation, and you’ve definitely heard your well-traveled cousin mention it a time or two. But, what is this elusive yet somehow ubiquitous thing called “dealing with culture shock?” How do you know when it hits? Can you prevent it full stop? How do you even begin to survive something you barely understand?! Well, we’ve asked our travel pros to give you a culture shock definition, walk you through the culture shock stages, and bequeath their best advice for how to survive it.<br /><br />The feeling of disorientation experienced by someone who is suddenly subjected to an unfamiliar culture, way of life, or set of attitudes. It’s some gnarly stuff, even after traveling around the world, culture shock stages hit you like a freight train sometimes. <br />How to cope with culture shock<br />We’re here with some real talk about dealing with culture shock and our tried and true survival methods for when it hits. Because it will. But, lucky for you, with our help it won’t hit quite so hard. And, when it does you’ll be able to bounce back to rock the rest of your time abroad. <br /><br />What does culture shock look like? <br />Culture shock stages will hit everyone a little differently, but generally there are four main stages involved. How hard each stage hits you, when each stage hits you, and the order in which you experience all of this will vary. It’s a bit of a rollercoaster! But, that’s all part of the adventure, right? <br /><br />Stage 1: The Honeymoon Stage<br />This is exactly what it sounds like—you’re in LOVE. It’s kind of like everyday is that song from The Lego Movie, like, “everything is awesome! Everything is cool when you’re part of a team!” Like, that’s kind of your life. You’re infatuated with the language, with the culture, the food, the people—the sky is bluer, the sun is brighter!<br /><br />Stage 2: The Frustration Stage. <br />In this stage of dealing with culture shock, everything hurts. You’re tired and you may or may not be dying. That high you were riding in the honeymoon stage is over. O-V-E-R. You don’t understand anything because of the language barrier. And, all you want is a Chipotle burrito with extra guacamole and it’s nowhere to be found. This feels like the stage that never ends. It just hangs out with you and will randomly show back up over the course of your experience, you never quite know when. This is when you might start feeling a little homesick and a lot like you’re resenting your decision to go abroad—especially if you’ve been at this awhile.<br /><br />Stage 3: The Adjustment Stage. <br />Okay. This is just life now. Navigating public transportation is getting easier. You can actually make small talk with vendors at the fruit market. And, you’re starting to feel part of a community. It’s all back on the up-and-up! Everything’s coming up YOU. <br /><br />Stage 4: The Acceptance Stage<br />[Take a breath.] This is life abroad. You have a routine now, and while you might not understand everything, or even like, everything—seriously, people eat chicken feet???—you’ve arrived at a new normal. It’s not weird, it’s different, and you may even find yourself adopting some new habits and tastes. <br /><br />5 culture shock coping strategies<br />I promise you will get over culture shock, everyone does, it’s all temporary. Here are five ways to survive culture shock:<br /><br />1. Do one difficult thing per day<br />One thing I found most helpful was telling myself to do at least one difficult—preferably social—thing per day. On hard days that was just buying groceries, but other days it was expat meet-ups, or dinner out with my coworkers. Continued emphasis on personal growth is a killer strategy for dealing with culture shock.<br /><br />2. Talk to others<br />The best way to survive culture shock is to talk with other people who are experiencing the exact same thing. Talk to your friends in your program; talk to your local coordinator; talk to anybody who is sharing that experience with you because they can truly empathize.<br /><br />3. Take time for yourself<br />Remember to take time for yourself—read, journal, go for a run, and if you need it, maybe even indulge in a little Parks and Rec. Something that really helped me was to have my own blog. This way, I was able to keep in contact with my family. But, also disconnect sometimes to make sure that you’re really present in your experience abroad.<br /><br />4. Practice acceptance<br />The sooner you accept how different everything is, the sooner you will find the parts of your new location that feel like they are really home.<br /><br />5. Focus on how it will feel on the other side<br />Culture shock is one of those things that when you’re in the moment it feels like it’s never going to end. But, as soon as you’re out of it, you realize you’ve learned so much about yourself. And you really will survive! I promise, I’ve been through it many times. It’s something you have to learn to love, and you. Will. Love it.<br /><br />Questions:<br />1.Have you ever encountered culture shock while travelling abroad? For example, in Japan, it is rude to talk on the trains, especially talking on the phone; in China: people spit on the street; in France, the wedding ceremony starts from afternoon to the midnight, etc. How do you deal with it?<br />2.What is your comfort level about traveling to countries having a culture and lifestyle that differs greatly from ours? Will you feel uncomfortable around poverty, pollution, and crazy traffic?<br />3.Do you prefer self-guided tour or joining a tour group arranged by a travel agency? Why? If you prefer independent tour, how do you plan a good tour? If you prefer joining a tour group, what’s your suggestion to find a good travel agency?<br />4.What’s your most memorable travel experience? Why?</div>
