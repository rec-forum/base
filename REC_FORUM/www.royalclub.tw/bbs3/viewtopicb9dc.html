I was sitting in 1D.<br />I was the only one who could talk to the flight attendants.<br />So I looked at them right away, and they said, &quot;No problem. <br />We probably hit some birds.&quot;<br />The pilot had already turned the plane around, and we weren't that far.<br />You could see Manhattan.<br />Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.<br />The pilot lines up the plane with the Hudson River.<br />That's usually not the route. He turns off the engines.<br />Now, imagine being in a plane with no sound.<br />And then he says three words. The most unemotional three words I've ever heard.<br />He says, &quot;Brace for impact.&quot;<br />I didn't have to talk to the flight attendant anymore. <br />I could see in her eyes, it was terror. Life was over.<br />Now I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.<br />I learned that it all changes in an instant.<br />We have this bucket list, we have these things we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to reach out to that I didn't, all the fences I wanted to mend, all the experiences I wanted to have and I never did.<br />As I thought about that later on, I came up with a saying, which is, &quot;I collect bad wines.&quot;<br />Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm opening it.<br />I no longer want to postpone anything in life.<br />And that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life.<br />The second thing I learned that day --and this is as we clear the George Washington Bridge, which was by not a lot --<br />I thought about, wow, I really feel one real regret. I've lived a good life.<br />In my own humanity and mistakes, I've tried to get better at everything I tried.<br />But in my humanity, I also allow my ego to get in.<br />And I regretted the time I wasted on things that did not matter with people that matter.<br />And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.<br />And after, as I reflected on that, I decided to eliminate negative energy from my life.<br />It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.<br />I've not had a fight with my wife in two years.<br />It feels great. I no longer try to be right; I choose to be happy.<br />The third thing I learned --and this is as your mental clock starts going, &quot;15, 14, 13.&quot;<br />You can see the water coming. I'm saying, &quot;Please blow up.&quot;<br />I don't want this thing to break in 20 pieces like you've seen in those documentaries.<br />And as we're coming down, I had a sense of, wow, dying is not scary.<br />It's almost like we've been preparing for it our whole lives.<br />But it was very sad. I didn't want to go; I love my life.<br />And that sadness really framed in one thought, which is, I only wish for one thing.<br />I only wish I could see my kids grow up.<br />About a month later, I was at a performance by my daughter --first-grader, not much artistic talent --<br />Yet! And I'm bawling, I'm crying, like a little kid. <br />And it made all the sense in the world to me.<br />I realized at that point, by connecting those two dots, that the only thing that matters in my life is being a great dad.<br />Above all, above all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good dad.<br />I was given the gift of a miracle, of not dying that day.<br />I was given another gift, which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differently.<br />I challenge you guys that are flying today, imagine the same thing happens on your plane --and please don't --but imagine, and how would you change?<br />What would you get done that you're waiting to get done because you think you'll be here forever?<br />How would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them?<br />And more than anything, are you being the best parent you can? Thank you.<br />Q1. Is there any experience you wanted to have and you never did?<br />Q2. What do you regret in your life?<br />Q3. At the last moment in your life; what is final thing you wish for?<br />Q4. Imagine the same thing happened to you and how would you change?<br /><br />Session II: Assurance given on algal reefs<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2021/02/26/2003752870">https://taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/arc ... 2003752870</a><!-- m --><br />SIGNATURE RACE: A referendum proposal to ask whether a planned CPC terminal should be moved needs 350,000 signatures by Sunday, but had only 123,700<br />•	By Jake Chung / Staff writer, with CNA<br />Every effort to protect algal reefs would be taken during the construction of CPC Corp, Taiwan’s (CPC) liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Taoyuan, while selecting a new site would likely delay gas distribution to Taipei by 11 years, resulting in power shortages, Executive Yuan spokesman Lo Ping-cheng (羅秉成) said yesterday.<br /><br />The state-run utility is building a LNG terminal off Datan Borough (大潭) in Taoyuan’s Guanyin District (觀音), a project that was approved by the Environmental Protection Administration in 2018.<br />Rescue Datan’s Algal Reefs Alliance convener Pan Chong-cheng (潘忠政) last year initiated a referendum proposal to protect the reefs.<br />The proposed referendum would ask: “Do you agree that CPC’s LNG terminal should be relocated from its planned site on the algal reef coast of Datan and its adjacent waters?”<br />The proposal has entered the second stage and campaigners need to collect 350,000 signatures by Sunday, as they need to review them before sending them to the Central Election Commission by the middle of next month, Pan said.<br />As of Wednesday, they had collected only 123,700 signatures, he said.<br /><br />Q1. Will you sign a petition: “Do you agree that CPC’s LNG terminal should be relocated from its planned site on the algal reef coast of Datan and its adjacent waters?” why or why not?<br />Q2. Selecting a new site would likely delay gas distribution to Taipei by 11 years, resulting in power shortages. Do you worry about power shortages in the future? <br />Q3. How can we balance economic development and environmental protection? If it can’t be done, which will you choose?<br />Q4. Do you think the referendum on algal reef conservation will pass? Why or why not?<br />非常值得一看的演講讓我們了解什麼叫做大潭藻礁<br /><br />轉一位很宅的海洋學教授，竟然走上Ted講堂。<br />她明顯很緊張，但每一重點都精闢。<br />後面提的牛耴糖及千層派更是絕妙關鍵。<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UaVIPj6Vy3c">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UaVIPj6Vy3c</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00 ~ 7:30 pm greetings &amp; free talk<br />7:30 ~ 8:15 pm guests introduced &amp; first session discussion<br />8:15 ~ 8:45 pm presentation, sharing the article &amp; other experiences<br />8:45 ~ 9:30 pm second session discussion<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven,<br />板橋民生路二段237 號,<br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30,<br /><br />P.S.<br />1.因聚會地點是在咖啡店內，所以有低消80元喔！<br />2.參加三次後，只要繳交1000元 (學生:500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />3.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~</div>
