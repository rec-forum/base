			<div class="content"><span style="color: #FF0000">*** Removal Notice ***<br />Thursday gathering of Royal Club is relocated to Ikari 怡客咖啡, 台北市衡陽路116號</span><br /><br />Session I:<br /><br />Dementia<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352013">https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-con ... c-20352013</a><!-- m --><br /><br />	Overview<br />Dementia describes a group of symptoms affecting memory, thinking and social abilities severely enough to interfere with your daily life. It isn't a specific disease, but several different diseases may cause dementia.<br />Though dementia generally involves memory loss, memory loss has different causes. Having memory loss alone doesn't mean you have dementia.<br />Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of a progressive dementia in older adults, but there are a number of causes of dementia. Depending on the cause, some dementia symptoms may be reversible.<br /><br />	Symptoms<br />Dementia symptoms vary depending on the cause, but common signs and symptoms include:<br />	Cognitive changes<br />•	Memory loss, which is usually noticed by a spouse or someone else<br />•	Difficulty communicating or finding words<br />•	Difficulty with visual and spatial abilities, such as getting lost while driving<br />•	Difficulty reasoning or problem-solving<br />•	Difficulty handling complex tasks<br />•	Difficulty with planning and organizing<br />•	Difficulty with coordination and motor functions<br />•	Confusion and disorientation<br />	Psychological changes<br />•	Personality changes<br />•	Depression<br />•	Anxiety<br />•	Inappropriate behavior<br />•	Paranoia<br />•	Agitation<br />•	Hallucinations<br /><br />	When to see a doctor<br />See a doctor if you or a loved one has memory problems or other dementia symptoms. Some treatable medical conditions can cause dementia symptoms, so it's important to determine the underlying cause.<br /><br />	Causes<br />Dementia is caused by damage to or loss of nerve cells and their connections in the brain. Depending on the area of the brain that's affected by the damage, dementia can affect people differently and cause different symptoms.<br />Dementias are often grouped by what they have in common, such as the protein or proteins deposited in the brain or the part of the brain that's affected. Some diseases look like dementias, such as those caused by a reaction to medications or vitamin deficiencies, and they might improve with treatment.<br /><br />	Progressive dementias<br />•	Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia.<br />Although not all causes of Alzheimer's disease are known, experts do know that a small percentage are related to mutations of three genes, which can be passed down from parent to child. While several different genes are probably involved in Alzheimer's disease, one important gene that increases risk is apolipoprotein E4 (APOE).<br />Alzheimer's disease patients have plaques and tangles in their brains. Plaques are clumps of a protein called beta-amyloid, and tangles are fibrous tangles made up of tau protein. It's thought that these clumps damage healthy neurons and the fibers connecting them.<br />Other genetic factors might make it more likely that people will develop Alzheimer's.<br /><br />	Risk factors<br />Many factors can eventually contribute to dementia. Some factors, such as age, can't be changed. Others can be addressed to reduce your risk.<br />	Risk factors that can't be changed<br />•	Age. The risk rises as you age, especially after age 65. However, dementia isn't a normal part of aging, and dementia can occur in younger people.<br />•	Family history. Having a family history of dementia puts you at greater risk of developing the condition. However, many people with a family history never develop symptoms, and many people without a family history do. There are tests to determine whether you have certain genetic mutations.<br />•	Down syndrome. By middle age, many people with Down syndrome develop early-onset Alzheimer's disease.<br /><br />	Risk factors you can change<br />You might be able to control the following risk factors for dementia.<br />•	Diet and exercise. Research shows that lack of exercise increases the risk of dementia. And while no specific diet is known to reduce dementia risk, research indicates a greater incidence of dementia in people who eat an unhealthy diet compared with those who follow a Mediterranean-style diet rich in produce, whole grains, nuts and seeds.<br />•	Heavy alcohol use. If you drink large amounts of alcohol, you might have a higher risk of dementia. While some studies have shown that moderate amounts of alcohol might have a protective effect, results are inconsistent. The relationship between moderate amounts of alcohol and dementia risk isn't well-understood.<br />•	Cardiovascular risk factors. These include high blood pressure (hypertension), high cholesterol, buildup of fats in your artery walls (atherosclerosis) and obesity.<br />•	Depression. Although not yet well-understood, late-life depression might indicate the development of dementia.<br />•	Diabetes. Having diabetes may increase your risk of dementia, especially if it's poorly controlled.<br />•	Smoking. Smoking might increase your risk of developing dementia and blood vessel (vascular) diseases.<br />•	Sleep apnea. People who snore and have episodes where they frequently stop breathing while asleep may have reversible memory loss.<br />•	Vitamin and nutritional deficiencies. Low levels of vitamin D, vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12 and folate may increase your risk of dementia.<br /><br />	Prevention<br />There's no sure way to prevent dementia, but there are steps you can take that might help. More research is needed, but it might be beneficial to do the following:<br />•	Keep your mind active. Mentally stimulating activities, such as reading, solving puzzles and playing word games, and memory training might delay the onset of dementia and decrease its effects.<br />•	Be physically and socially active. Physical activity and social interaction might delay the onset of dementia and reduce its symptoms. Move more and aim for 150 minutes of exercise a week.<br />•	Quit smoking. Some studies have shown that smoking in middle age and beyond may increase your risk of dementia and blood vessel (vascular) conditions. Quitting smoking might reduce your risk and will improve your health.<br />•	Get enough vitamins. Some research suggests that people with low levels of vitamin D in their blood are more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. You can get vitamin D through certain foods, supplements and sun exposure.<br />More study is needed before an increase in vitamin D intake is recommended for preventing dementia, but it's a good idea to make sure you get adequate vitamin D. Taking a daily B-complex vitamin and vitamin C may also be helpful.<br />•	Manage cardiovascular risk factors. Treat high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and high body mass index (BMI). High blood pressure might lead to a higher risk of some types of dementia. More research is needed to determine whether treating high blood pressure may reduce the risk of dementia.<br />•	Treat health conditions. See your doctor for treatment if you experience hearing loss, depression or anxiety.<br />•	Maintain a healthy diet. Eating a healthy diet is important for many reasons, but a diet such as the Mediterranean diet — rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and omega-3 fatty acids, which are commonly found in certain fish and nuts — might promote health and lower your risk of developing dementia. This type of diet also improves cardiovascular health, which may help lower dementia risk. Try eating fatty fish such as salmon three times a week, and a handful of nuts — especially almonds and walnuts — daily.<br />•	Get quality sleep. Practice good sleep hygiene, and talk to your doctor if you snore loudly or have periods where you stop breathing or gasp during sleep.<br /><br />Questions<br />1. Do you know anyone who is a case of dementia? Share with us what you have known.<br />2. How would you feel if your mother or spouse could not recognize and remember you?<br />3. What would you do if your mother or spouse suffers from dementia? She is easy to get lost even around your home. Would you send her to nursing home?<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Session II:<br /><br />Authorities shut down ‘largest’ video piracy site<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2020/04/09/2003734279">https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan ... 2003734279</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The Criminal Investigation Bureau has shut down what was reportedly the nation’s top video piracy Web site, 8maple.ru (楓林網), and arrested its two alleged proprietors in Taoyuan.<br /><br />Authorities estimated that the site had infringed on NT$1 billion (US$33.2 million) in copyrights owned by the movie and TV industries.<br />The crackdown was the result of international cooperation with the US’ Motion Picture Association, Japan’s Content Overseas Distribution Association, and local TV networks initiating probes and providing authorities with evidence of illegal downloads, bureau officials said.<br />The site allowed users to download movies and TV shows from Taiwan, China, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, the US and Europe for free, Telecommunications Investigation Corps section head Chen Juei-chin (陳瑞金) told a media briefing.<br /><br />“The site was in 2014 started in Taiwan by the two suspects, who have the expertise as they are software engineers,” Chen said. “They made about NT$2 million in monthly revenue from business and service company ads on the site.”<br />At the start, the two men promoted the site as an online commercial advertising service, but soon turned it into a video piracy site, for which they paid a total of NT$300,000 monthly for 25 servers in five countries — the US, Canada, Ukraine, France and Romania — to avoid investigation and prosecution by Taiwanese authorities, Chen added.<br />A bureau investigation found that monthly downloads from the site reached about 30 million, while the proprietors made about NT$4 million in advertising revenue.<br /><br />The site was reportedly Taiwan’s top site for downloading movies and TV shows for free, and was also popular with people in China and other countries, becoming a prominent international piracy site.<br />The two suspects, surnamed Chen (陳), 33, and Chuang (莊), 32, are friends who were in the same software engineering program and graduated at the top of their class, for which they received scholarships for graduate studies at National Taiwan University, bureau officials said.<br />Investigators found that the two men had purchased two luxury mansions in Taoyuan, allegedly using their illegal profits from running the site to each pay NT$16 million in cash for the properties.<br /><br />After weeks of surveillance and collecting evidence, the bureau coordinated with Taoyuan prosecutors and local police to conduct the raid at the end of last month, leading to the arrests of the two suspects, as well as the seizure of their properties and NT$60 million in their bank accounts, bureau officials said.<br />The officials quoted the two as saying that they started the site because they are both fans of TV dramas and foreign movies, so they decided to put their software expertise to good use in the name of entertainment and profit.<br /><br />Questions:<br />1- Do you have any comment on the event?<br />2. What do you want to say to the suspects if you had known what they do in 2014?    <br />3. Apart from films and TV programs what do you do for amusement?<br /><br />=======================================================================================================================<br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00 pm-7:30 pm Free talk<br />7:30 pm-8:10 pm Session 1 discussion<br />8:10 pm-8:40 pm Presentation (At least two members of each table are invited)<br />8:40 pm-8:45 pm Break time &amp; Group picture<br />8:45 pm-9:15 pm Session 2 discussion<br />9:15 pm-9:30 pm Presentation<br /><br /><br />P.S.<br />1.因聚會地點是在咖啡店內，所以有低消80元喔!<br />2.參加三次後，只要繳交500元，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />3.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會!</div>
