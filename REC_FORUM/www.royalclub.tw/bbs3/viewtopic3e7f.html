Retell the case in English as a group. <br />2.	Do you agree to the idea that Lee Yun, the lady in the case, or any other worker, should offer pay cut to hold onto her jobs? Why or why not? <br />3.	What should Lee Yun do to survive if her friend didn't have any job offer? <br />4.	Why would women's age be such a big deal in local corporate culture? <br />5.	If you were in Lee Yun's shoes, what would you have done differently?<br />Topic 2: Do zodiac signs reveal who we really are?<br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.thoughtco.com/your-zodiac-sign-lesson-plan-1212277">https://www.thoughtco.com/your-zodiac-s ... an-1212277</a><!-- m --> <br /><br />After reading discussions: <br />1.	Do you think our personality is shaped by zodiac signs, or affected by our experiences? In what ways? <br />2.	How has your personality changed since you were out of school? <br />3.	If you could change one aspect of your personality, what would you change?<br />4.	What personality traits do you think are most important for a friend to have? A spouse? A boss? A teacher? <br />5.
