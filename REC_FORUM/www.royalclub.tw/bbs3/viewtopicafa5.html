				<div class="content">It’s my honor to be host this Thursday 7/12. Many topics discussed in our club before are more focused on News/knowledge/Emotion/Philosophy/habit etc which really enrich our life and broaden our view and lead us toward healthier direction. Today, I choose softer topic “Meditation &amp; Yoga” which make us healthy mentally and physically according to my experience. Let’s discuss this soft topic in session one. Session 2, let’s discuss 10 ways to have a better conversation. Listening to Ted speech is my recommended way to improve your English listening skill.
