Super typhoon  Mangkhut which was the strongest one in 2018 damaged Philippines badly and in Taiwan only Taitung county declared typhoon holiday.<br />Global warming results in many typhoons even super typhoons.  Last year 2/3 of typhoons missed Taiwan but hit Japan one by one again and again because of northbound subtropical high .(亞熱帶高壓)<br /> Do you think this year Taiwan will have  a good luck again? <br />Q1. How do you prepare for a typhoon before it comes ? What experiences/ lessons did you learn from past typhoons?<br />Q2. What are your pastime activities except sleeping during typhoon holiday?<br />Q3. When Ma Ying-jeou was a Taipei mayor once declaring 3 times of typhoon days off  consecutively ,  we found eventually we're not deserved 3 days off because there's no strong breeze and downpour at all. In 2018 Mayor Ko respected professionals and brought SOP( Standard Operating Procedure)  to declare work as usual tomorrow although he was against the consensus that Keelug , New Taipei city and Taipei city should make the the same decision to concern three cities belonging  to one life circle .Eventually we found there's no disastrous situation ,but it still drew a lot of criticism. What do you think about this issue? <br />Q4. Do you buy typhoon insurance for your house ? Why ?<br /><br />Suggested Agenda<br />7:00 p.m. --7:30 p.m. free talk <br />7:30 p.m. --8:10 p.m. first topic discussion <br />8:10 p.m. --8:20 p.m. Presentation <br />8:20 p.m.-- 8:40 p.m. Sharing time : articles &amp; other experiences. <br />8:40 p.m.-- 9.:15 p.m. second topic discussion <br />9:15 p.m.-- 9:30 p.m. Presentation<br />speaker time : 2 minutes for each speaker<br />host time : 3 minutes<br /><br />The meeting place of Thursday:<br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第一區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
