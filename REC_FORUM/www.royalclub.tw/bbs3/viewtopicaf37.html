			<div class="content">4/23(Sat.)The Complete Guide to Deliberate Practice/Ultimate sleep hack: I spent a month trying every type of advice(Host: Danny)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Article I: The Complete Guide to Deliberate Practice<br />Link: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://betterhumans.coach.me/the-complete-guide-to-deliberate-practice-3a70319be3af">https://betterhumans.coach.me/the-compl ... 70319be3af</a><!-- m --></span><br /><br />We are capable of incredible feats, but they won’t come without focused effort, consistent feedback, and expert guidance.<br /><br />In 2008, Malcolm Gladwell published his third nonfiction book, Outliers: The Story of Success. The book is perhaps best known for introducing the world to the concept of “10,000 hours to mastery”:<br /><br />The idea that excellence at performing a complex task requires a critical minimum level of practice surfaces again and again in studies of expertise. In fact, researchers have settled on what they believe is the magic number for true expertise: ten thousand hours.<br /><br />And a few paragraphs later:<br /><br />Ten thousand hours is the magic number of greatness.<br /><br />These ideas took hold, inspiring everyone from Dan McLaughlin, who tried to put in 10,000 hours of golf training to play in the PGA Tour, to Tony Hsieh, who believes that great entrepreneurs are made from 10,000 hours of practice.<br /><br />Today, Gladwell says that “no one is more surprised than me that [10,000 hours] was the average takeaway” and claims his emphasis on the number was meant to serve an “argumentative function” about the support and resources needed to reach the highest levels of performance.<br /><br />The wildly overstated precision of the 10,000-hours concept took hold as the most well-known detail within the concept of “deliberate practice.” Despite Gladwell’s suspect level of precision, he did help popularize important findings on how people develop expertise and reach high levels of performance—findings that were uncovered by a number of psychology researchers, most prominently Anders Ericsson.<br /><br />As a professor of psychology at Florida State University, Ericsson has been studying ballerinas, doctors, violinists, teachers, and chess masters, among other kinds of experts, for three decades.<br /><br />But his pioneering work began in memory. Ericsson coached several grad students who had no prior memorization experience to reach astounding levels of memory in just a few years. In 1979, his test subject, a cross-country runner named Steve Faloon, was able to memorize 82 digits in a row—a feat on par with world champion mnemonists at the time. Ericsson was fascinated by how Faloon got so good so quickly, and thus began a lifelong interest in studying practice and the development of expertise.<br /><br />I am passionate about improving. As a former gymnast, I spent more than a decade training four hours a day, five days a week, in a grueling, difficult sport, finishing my career as a member of Stanford’s NCAA championship-winning team. I have studied and put into practice, sometimes inadvertently, many of the tenants of deliberate. [Editor’s note: Jason is also a YC founder and, in his spare time, set a world record for a particularly hard form of pushups.]<br /><br />Based on my personal experience, careful reading of many papers and books (including Ericsson’s own Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise, published in 2016), as well as a lengthy phone conversation with Ericsson, I am excited to share everything I’ve learned about practice and becoming a world-class performer.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Defining Deliberate Practice</span><br /><br />Deliberate practice is a planned, effortful series of activities designed to improve skill in a particular domain and guided by well-informed feedback.<br />While that may seem like a simple, almost obvious definition, here are some points to keep in mind about what deliberate practice is not:<br /><br />●Deliberate practice is not mindless repetition. If that were true, most Americans would be expert drivers and speakers, since many of us drive and speak every day.<br />●Deliberate practice is not sporadic. Because of its planned nature, deliberate practice typically involves building up layers and layers of skill and understanding over time. A haphazard approach to practice does not achieve this.<br />●Deliberate practice is not relaxing. Following a plan, responding to feedback, and pushing oneself is cognitively demanding and physically tiring. Most people can’t last more than few hours at a time.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Deliberate Practice with a Master Teacher</span><br /><br />The video below is perhaps one of the best demonstrations of deliberate practice under the guidance of a master teacher. Benjamin Zander is the founder and 30-plus-year conductor of the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra. At the PopTech! conference in 2008, he coached a strong 15-year-old cellist on a Bach bourrée:<br /><br />Some takeaways from the video:<br /><br />●Great coaches/teachers need to be experts themselves. Zander demonstrates this with his understanding of the piece. Though he is a conductor, Zander easily plays sections of the bourrée on both the piano and cello.<br />●Zander pays close attention to the student’s performance and provides a ton of immediate feedback, acknowledging improvements while noting mistakes.<br />●By introducing the “how fascinating!” concept, Zander prevents the student from shutting down when he makes a mistake while making sure the mistake was noticed and thus more likely to be corrected.<br />●Instead of musical jargon or vague concepts, Zander uses plain language, metaphors, and gestures to help the student understand the piece in a more intuitive way.<br />●To make sure the student isn’t mindlessly going through the corrections, Zander quizzes him on the right way to do things, forcing the student to think about what he’s performing.<br />●Zander tries to withhold heavy applause from the audience until the very end, when the student gets it right, and he allows all that good work to be rewarded and reinforced in the student’s brain.<br /><br />At the end of the clip, the student has made vast strides in his performance. The results speak for themselves.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How Deliberate Practice Shapes the Brain</span><br /><br />The fact that adults can improve dramatically in a skill through deliberate practice means that some kind of neurological change must be happening in the brain.<br /><br />The key is in increasing the speed and fluidity of our neural impulses through a fatty white tissue called myelin. Brain scans of musicians via diffusion MRI find that the areas of the brain associated with finger motor skills and visual and audio processing, among others, have more myelin compared to nonmusicians, and the density of myelin was directly correlated with how many hours the musicians practiced over the years.<br /><br />Relatedly, demyelination can occur with diseases like multiple sclerosis, which can lead to loss of dexterity, blurry vision, and general weakness and fatigue, which is what you’d expect when your neurons no longer fire properly.<br /><br />Imagine we have a bunch of homes that are connected by telephone cables. Occasionally, people like to gossip — Nikhil calls Rachel, Rachel calls Marshall, Marshall calls Fei. Let’s say the telephone company notices certain patterns of activity in the network, like Rachel calling Marshall almost every night with some new scoop. The company then dispatches a worker to upgrade the ordinary cable between Rachel and Marshall’s house with a high-speed fiber-optic cable. Now these calls are accelerated and the messages go through much faster.<br /><br />This is basically how the brain works. Two important cells (that are not themselves neurons) exist in the brain. One of these cells monitors neuron activity. When it senses a lot of repeated activity, it releases chemicals that induce the second cell to produce myelin, which then wraps around the neuron’s axon body (the “telephone cable”). Myelin acts like a fiber-optic cable, increasing the speed and strength of nerve impulses, which leads to better performance.<br /><br />This is in part why getting feedback and making corrections during practice is so important. If we practice poorly and do not correct our mistakes, we will myelinate those axons, increasing the speed and strength of those signals — which does us no good.<br /><br />Now that we’ve taken a deep dive into the brain mechanics behind deliberate practice, let’s take a step up and look at how deliberate practice creates expertise and superior performance.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How Deliberate Practice Creates Mental Representations</span><br /><br />Ericsson defines an expert as someone who can consistently produce superior performance on a range of representative tasks in a given domain (chess, violin, programming). In other words, a master.<br /><br />What do masters have that mediocre and even solidly good performers do not? A strong mental representation. A mental representation is like a really well-developed mental model of how the world should work.<br /><br />Some examples:<br /><br />●When soccer players and non-soccer players watch a clip of a soccer game, the players are much better at remembering where all the other players on the field were and predicting what would happen next.<br />●Great engineering managers often have a sense of what part of a system might be producing the bug, even if they’ve only skimmed through the codebase.<br />●My old gymnastics teammate and former U.S. national champion David Sender would sometimes get stuck on a learning a skill. He’d watch someone do it one time, and then immediately understand how to perform it himself.<br /><br />As Ericsson says in Peak:<br /><span style="font-style: italic"><br />[Mental representations are] preexisting patterns of information — facts, images, rules relationships, and so on — that are held in long-term memory and that can be used to respond quickly and effectively in certain types of situations. The thing that all mental representations have in common is that they make it possible to process large amounts of information quickly, despite the limitations of short term memory.</span><br /><br />Mastery is what you can achieve after decades of deliberate practice, and mental representation is your secret weapon in your corner.<br /><br />Mastery is a beautiful thing, and it is possible with deliberate practice. Magnus Carlsen, the reigning chess champion since 2013, has played simultaneous games against 10 other players without looking at the board. The U.S. Navy was able to achieve a 500 percent improvement in its air combat kill ratio after implementing the infamous “Top Gun” training program, because its pilots learned how to push their aircraft to the limit and survive. Colombian archer Sara Lopez set the world record in 2013 for the 15-arrow match—launching each of her arrows directly in the middle of a three-inch center ring on a target 150 feet away—because she intimately understands her bow and how her arrow release affects the arrow’s flight.<br /><br />Let’s look at how we get there.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Putting Deliberate Practice into Practice</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Choose Well-Defined Goals</span><br />When I reflect on my gymnastics training as a whole, I can hardly believe I went from being a clumsy and hyperactive six-year-old to a powerful, coordinated, and acrobatic elite athlete. But it’s because I was striving toward a goal every step of the way. I had a goal to learn how to do a single circle on the pommel horse. Then 10 circles in a row. Then circles while traveling across the horse. Then a whole routine. Then the whole routine with perfectly straight legs and pointed toes.<br /><br />As you approach your deliberate practice, make sure you can measure your performance and constantly set small, specific, achievable goals for yourself. The Suzuki method of learning to play the violin is a perfect example: Each book builds on the last one, and each song in the book is a little harder than the one before it.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Get Frequent Feedback</span><br />A recent New York magazine profile revealed how comedian Aziz Ansari was able to nail the SNL opening monologue he performed on the day of Trump’s inauguration. Far from winging the performance, Ansari had done nearly 100 shows in the month leading up to his nine-minute sketch, getting valuable feedback from live audiences that helped him refine his jokes and delivery. From the article:<br /><br />What no one saw, though, were the 100 stand-up sets Ansari had done, mostly at New York’s Comedy Cellar, over the course of a month to get ready for his nine minutes on air. He’d skipped the holidays at home and ­performed up to nine times in a night. According to [Chris] Rock, that’s what Ansari had to do to get out of his comfort zone.<br />Without feedback, you have no way of refining your practice and your abilities will plateau. For instance, if you’re trying to become a better cook, consider hosting a dinner party every week; ask your guests for honest, anonymous scoring of your dishes. Taking their comments into account, refine your approach for the following week.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Break It Down</span><br />As Ericsson says in Peak:<br /><br />Deliberate practice nearly always involves building or modifying previous acquired skills by focusing on particular aspects of the skills and working to improve them specifically.<br />While we often want to make improvements in a lot of areas at once, that’s not how deliberate practice works. Our brains struggle to multitask, and it’s much easier to respond to one specific piece of feedback than to try to change everything at once.<br /><br />To improve your communication skills, you first have to break the concept into areas: writing skills, presentation skills, and conversational skills. Let’s say you want to focus on conversational skills. You can then further break that area into components like active listening, building on ideas, using humor, sharing stories. Now you can pick one of these components to focus on, like active listening, and set a goal of using active listening to summarize what someone is telling you for each of your one-to-one meetings this week. Once you’ve mastered that, you can layer in humor and so on.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Never Stop Pushing Yourself</span><br />Deliberate practice takes place outside one’s comfort zone and requires a student to constantly try things that are just beyond his current abilities. Thus it to commands near maximal effort, which is generally not enjoyable.<br />While scientists or musicians sometimes like to say they’ve never worked a day in their life, the fact is that practice is hard work. It is tiring and requires grit. If you’re only consuming information, you’re not doing deliberate practice, and you’re probably not improving very much.<br /><br />Kobe Bryant’s legendary work ethic carried him throughout his long basketball career. For the 2008 Olympics, a sporting event that most NBA players don’t take very seriously, Kobe was in the gym at 5 a.m. doing strength conditioning and shooting until he made 800 baskets, just in time for the 11 a.m. team workout.<br /><br />Don’t get me wrong: It’s important to rest, or your practice won’t sink in, but never forget that the only way to build skill is to go a little further than last time.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Get a Coach</span><br />I would argue that a couple of hours with a tennis coach is going to improve your backhand volley so much more than playing maybe even for several years with your friends. That attitude of actually pinpointing something and then figuring out, “What are the best conditions under which you would be able to improve it?” and then basically work under those conditions until you’ve actually changed it [is critical] and only then do you actually start using it and embedding it in the normal activity.<br />This can be a difficult ask for many people, because while we all understand the idea of coaches for sports and teachers for certain subjects, most professions do not have dedicated coaches. Not the kind who will work with you and offer one-to-one feedback and expert counsel to actually improve your training.<br /><br />One way to get around this is to research the examples of the best people in your field and study them like they were your teachers. If you’re in advertising, look for the most powerful commercials you can find and deconstruct them. If you’re a programmer, review the code of highly respected open-source software repos. If you’re a writer, analyze the best articles from the New Yorker or Medium, or, as Benjamin Franklin did, try rewriting them in your own words and comparing the two essays.<br /><br />But if you can find a real coach, either someone you hire or a good friend who’s really good at what they do and willing to be open with their comments and generous with their time, you can accelerate your learning and improvement through targeted coaching work. The right teacher is most definitely worth the money and time investment.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Conclusion</span><br /><br />Of course, there’s more to deliberate practice than we could cover here, but I hope this article gave you both a high-level overview and concrete tactics that you can start using tomorrow. The bottom line is that we are capable of incredible feats, but they won’t come without focused effort, consistent feedback, and expert guidance.<br /><br />I’ll wrap up with more from Ericsson in Peak:<br /><br />One way to think about this as simply as a reflection of the fact that, to date, we have found no limitation to the improvements that can be made with particular types of practice. As training techniques are improved and new heights of achievement are discovered, people in every area of human endeavor of constantly finding ways to get better, to raise the bar on what was thought to be possible, and there is no sign that this will stop.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion</span><br /><br />1. After reading the article, do you agree with Malcolm Gladwell's view of the point? <br />2. Are you learning a new thing? Please share how you practice that.<br />2. And, Do you have any idea to change your way to practice? (According to the article) Please share with the members.<br /><br /><br /><br />/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////<br />/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Article II: Ultimate sleep hack: I spent a month trying every type of advice<br />Link:<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/4b0273af-2963-4121-9370-0ab30625f4f7" class="postlink">https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/4b0273af-2963-4121-9370-0ab30625f4f7</a></span><br /><br /><br />No coffee after 2pm, no lie-ins and no phones in the bedroom. One woman followed all the rules to find out what really works<br /><br />It's World Sleep Day, but hands up if you’re actually getting good sleep? Deep, restorative rest where you’re punching out seven to nine hours of uninterrupted zzz’s each night. Anyone? <br /><br />Nope, me neither.<br /><br />In 2017, the Sleep Council's The Great British Bedtime Report discovered that 30% of us &quot;get a poor sleep most nights&quot; and 74% of Brits get less than seven hours of shut-eye a night, with 12% getting less than five hours. It's no wonder that leading sleep scientist Matthew Walker says we're struggling with a “global sleep loss epidemic&quot;.<br /><br />If we’re getting six hours or less a night, we’re technically “under-slept”, says Walker, who believes that sleep deprivation is shortening our lives.<br /><br />I’ve had trouble sleeping for 17 years. I'm a diagnosed insomniac. Staring at ceilings and out of windows for hours on end is my nightly norm, and being tired for nearly two decades affects everything from how I work to what I eat. I’ve seen countless GPs and sleep doctors, taken sleeping pills and invested in a high-quality mattress. I've tried white noise, relaxation apps and binge-read what feels like every book about sleep. I’m also forever Googling sleep hacks: those little tweaks to our lifestyles that promise better snoozing – but I’m ashamed to say I’ve never really committed to any of them.<br /><br />And that is apparently where the solution could lie. Walker tells me that making certain changes to our night-time lives can make us more productive, creative and emotionally resilient. I set myself a challenge: find the most consistently recommended sleep hacks and trial them simultaneously for one month.<br /><br />As well as Matthew Walker, I spoke to Dr Michael Breus, a clinical psychologist who calls himself 'The Sleep Doctor', and Christine Hansen, a holistic sleep expert. I cross-referenced their advice and these were the five changes they thought could make the biggest difference to my sleep – if I stuck to them: <br /><br />1. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day (farewell sweet Sunday lie-in)<br /><br />2. No caffeine after 2pm (Is that even possible?)<br /><br />3. No electronic devices in the bedroom (I imagine this must be what it's like if you have a baby and move him/her to a separate room for the first time)<br /><br />4. No food within two hours of bedtime (note to self: larger portions needed at dinner)<br /><br />5. If you wake up and can’t get back to sleep, go to another room and do an activity <br /><br />Here's how it all went down… <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">WEEK ONE</span><br /><br />I set an alarm for 8.30am, have my coffee almost before my eyes are fully open, eat my boiled eggs and toast, do Pilates and get to my desk for 10am. I pledge to forgo my usual 3pm coffee.<br /><br />I’ve decided 10.30pm will be my bedtime. &quot;Of all the sleep tips to stick to, the most important one is a sleep schedule,” Dr Breus had told me. “When sleep has a regular rhythm, your biological clock will be in sync, and all your other bodily functions will go smoother, including sleep.” I set a reminder on my phone so it chimes half an hour before, so I know when to hit ‘stop’ on an episode of The Good Place and get my PJs on.<br /><br />I usually eat around 7.30pm, so giving myself two food-free hours before bed should be easy. Hansen says: &quot;Everyone is going to be different, but if you're having trouble sleeping, I'd suggest having dinner by 7.30pm.&quot;<br /><br />My boyfriend and I leave our phones on the landing outside our bedroom, like they’ve been punished. At first, I actually have separation anxiety. But Walker and Dr Breus explain that the light in our phones discourages melatonin production, which is the hormone that helps you sleep.<br /><br />I am also unreasonably upset to kiss my weekend lie-in goodbye. But the most difficult tip to get used to is moving to another room when I can’t sleep - which is every night this week. It’s cold and I’m so used to just lying there, it’s a real effort to drag myself out of bed. It does break up the monotony of insomnia, though. I follow Walker's advice: &quot;If you've been awake 20 minutes, get up and go to another room and in dim light, read a book or meditate, don't open laptops or emails, and only when you feel sleepy again should you return to bed. It’s about helping the brain to relearn the association that bed is somewhere to sleep rather than be awake.&quot;<br /><br />I do everything I’m told, but my sleep does not improve. Apparently these changes take time to work. Yawn.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">WEEK TWO</span><br /><br />At the start of this week I stay out late with a friend, missing my bedtime curfew. I have two and a half glasses of wine but no dinner. I sleep fitfully, as you do when the room is spinning. Walker crushes my fun with some science: &quot;Alcohol is probably the most misunderstood of all chemicals we use for sleep. People often say you can have a night cap and fall asleep more quickly – but alcohol is a sedative, and sedation doesn't give you the benefits of natural sleep.” I feel he is right on this one: I never sleep well on nights I drink alcohol.<br /><br />For the rest of the week, I stick to my bedtime and wake time, eat dinner early, slay my pre-2pm coffee rule, banish my phone from the room and get up if I’m lying awake. On day 12, I have a memorably good night’s sleep, dreaming that I am cast in a musical directed by Harry Styles, and wake up feeling chirpy and even, shockingly, in the mood for some exercise (usually I have to blackmail myself into it). In a fit of optimistic cheer, I declare this whole challenge a triumph. And then almost immediately feel an impulse to rebel against it and give the whole thing up.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">WEEK THREE</span><br /><br />The ‘good’ sleep lasts three nights. Three nights banish without creeping out of the bedroom in the middle of the night. I wake feeling energised and calm. But then, the insomnia creeps back inexplicably, as it often does. My sleep issues are related to on-going bouts of depression and my mood is a bit down, which is probably affecting my ability to nod off. <br /><br />Insomnia is lonely. Listening to my boyfriend sleep (and sometimes sleep-talk about cheese) can make it feel like I’m the only person awake on the planet. It’s also boring, but forcing myself out of bed to do something partially solves that. I am getting through books faster than usual and distracting myself until I feel like I could sleep again feels like it works.<br /><br />Skipping the afternoon coffee means there’s zero caffeine in my body by nightfall – sometimes I feel like I could nap at 6pm. I have three more nights this week where I don't have to get out of bed. I wake momentarily in the night but fall asleep again easily. By day, I genuinely feel more present, like I've lifted a fog, and I feel physically energised. I celebrate with an accidentally-on-purpose lie-in on the Saturday. It was lovely and I don't think it affected my overall capacity to sleep, though I know sleep expert Matthew Walker would scold me for it; &quot;We actually call sleeping in social jetlag,&quot; he says. &quot;And you’re dragging your body-clock, your 24-hour 'circadian rhythm', back and forwards in time on a weekly basis. That’s harmful to your health.&quot;<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">WEEK FOUR</span><br /><br />I go to bed at midnight one night after a great all-women comedy night, but, on the whole, I am being so compliant with my challenge that I develop a smugness as bedtime approaches this week, even though I haven’t fully solved my insomnia. And I have to confess, my phone creeps in to the bedroom a couple of times. I’ve got a big work deadline and am struggling to tear my focus away from it. But I notice the difference when it’s there: when I wake up in the night, I feel Twitter, Instagram and the Polygon puzzle calling me from the corner of the room, which hasn’t happened these past three weeks. It takes extreme self-restraint not to pick it up. Instead, I exile myself to the living room and read my paperback book until my eyes get dry.<br /><br />I notice that I’m feeling less scared of bedtime. When you're an insomniac, you dread the fall of night and the struggle to get enough sleep to function the next day. For the first time in a long time, I remember what ‘good’ sleep actually feels like.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">THE VERDICT</span><br /><br />Here’s the thing: you can’t solve insomnia in a month. I didn’t carry out the challenge flawlessly (I’m human), but I will say this: having a routine that’s as consistent as possible does help.<br /><br />Setting a bedtime and a wake time encourages you to prioritise your sleep and make sensible decisions to support it. That’s what it comes down to: proactively and conscientiously making sleep an integral part of your routine, just like cleaning your teeth, taking a shower and getting three meals a day.  <br /><br />Eating early was easy for me because I am a pensioner at heart and love an early mealtime. Having my phone outside the bedroom was not because I am frighteningly attached to it. But I’m going to stick with it. I’m also going to stick with getting up in the night when I can’t sleep – even though it’s difficult (especially on these freezing nights).<br /><br />One thing I might get less strict about? I don’t think I can resist the occasional lie in.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion:</span><br />1. When do you get on the bed? Do you use electronic devices in the bed?  What you don't do before sleep?  <br />2. Have you ever had the problem with insomnia? <br />3.
