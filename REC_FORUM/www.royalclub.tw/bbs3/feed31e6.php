5/14(Sun.) Japanese Trends: Why Are People Eating Less Rice?/ £1.3 million lottery winner went back to work at McDonald's after winning life changing money<br /><br />Agenda:<br />7:00-7:05 pm Opening Remarks<br />Session 1:<br />7:05-7:40 pm<br />Individual Presentation<br />7:40-8:00<br />Group discussion.<br />Session 2.<br />8:00-8:40 pm<br />Individual<br />8：40-9:00 pm<br />Group discussion.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://zoomtw.zoom.us/j/92987266213?pw">https://zoomtw.zoom.us/j/92987266213?pw</a><!-- m --> ...<br />Meeting ID:929 8726 6213<br />Password:112233<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Japanese Trends: Why Are People Eating Less Rice?</span><br /><br />A recent survey of 1,000 people by Makino, a rice retail company in Chiba prefecture, found that although 85% of Japanese people eat rice every day, 68% eat it only once a day. And only 17% eat rice for all three meals. Rice consumption in Japan has been falling since the 1960s. According to Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries — or MAFF — Japanese rice consumption peaked in 1962 at around 118 kilograms per person, and has been falling ever since. By 2020, rice consumption was just over 50 kilograms per person — under half the 1962 figure. This trend away from rice seems to have developed from efforts to improve people's diets after World War II. After the war there wasn't enough food in Japan, so the US provided wheat flour that was used to make bread for school lunches. During the 1950s and 1960s, the Japanese government also encouraged people to eat more Western foods such as bread, meat and dairy products, which were seen as more healthy.<br />More recently, an increase in people living alone and in families where both parents are working has led to a change in eating habits. Traditional Japanese family meals with rice take time to prepare, but simple meals with bread or noodles can be prepared very quickly. Now MAFF is trying to reverse this trend by promoting the use of rice in school lunches and providing information on the health benefits of rice. In recent years, the Japanese government has also been promoting rice flour as a healthy, gluten-free alternative to wheat flour, and has been trying to increase rice flour exports abroad. As wheat prices rise because of the weak yen and the war in Ukraine, rice flour could also become more popular in Japan.<br />Discussions:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />1.Are you surprised that only 17% eat rice for three meals in Japan? How often do you eat rice?<br />2.Have you changed your eating habit from rice to Western food? <br /> Do you consider Western food to be healthy?<br />3. How often do you cook at home? Do you think eating at home is healthier and save money?  <br />4.What is your staple foods – rice, noodles, steamed bun or others ? <br />5.What kind of Taiwan traditional foods would you like to recommend ?<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">£1.3 million lottery winner went back to work at McDonald's after winning life changing money, 01 April 2023, Ali Condon</span><br />When a lucky punter bagged a whopping £1.3 million in the National Lottery, he had the opportunity to change his life forever. But, it turned out that 25-year-old Luke Pittard actually quite liked his life the way it was. So, not long after winning the fortune, he decided to turn in his luxury life and head back to work at McDonald's. Luke was working as a staff trainer at McDonald's in Pontprennau, Cardiff when he won the colossal stack of cash back in 2006.Not only did he have great mates at the fast food joint, but it's where he met his future wife, Emma Cox. When you win a million pound jackpot, it seems only right to hand in your notice and kick your feet up, so that's what Luke did. During his time away he went in on his new millionaire lifestyle, splashing out on a trip to the Canary Islands, a dream wedding for him and Emma, and a property worth over £200k.But eventually, Luke realised that there was 'more to life than money', and started to miss his pals at McDonald's. So, a year and a half after his big win, Luke decided to return to work.<br />&quot;I loved working at McDonald's before I became a millionaire and I'm really enjoying being back there again,&quot; he told The Sun at the time. &quot;Lots of my old McDonald's workmates came to our wedding and I had kept in touch with them all the time, so I just thought: 'Why not go back?' &quot;He added: &quot;You can only go shopping a certain number of times before you start seeing the same things. It was getting boring and repetitive and I put on a stone in weight. I was eating constantly. &quot;I enjoy going to work. It’s better than staying at home all day. &quot;And Luke has been able to use his winnings to make the working day a little bit easier.&quot;I used to walk to work all the time but now I get a taxi there and back. &quot;If that isn't the high life, I don't know what is. Even though he made more money per week on interest on his lottery winnings than he did in McDonald's, Luke's wife Emma fully supported his decision. &quot;I can totally understand it. We both really enjoyed working at McDonald's and still have good friends there. &quot;So it was really familiar for him and something for him to look forward to.&quot;<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />Discussions:<br />1.If you are the jackpot winner, will you quit your job immediately? Why ?<br />2.How will you distribute your money and what will you do to spend your money?<br />3.According to the statistic in America, the people who win the big jackpot will go bankruptcy with 3-5 years. What do you think the reasons?<br />4.Have you even bought any lottery and what’s your expectation? To try your luckiness or win money to become a millionaire?<br />5.Have your friends or relatives had experienced to win lottery? Share us.<br /></div></blockquote><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12531">Danny Lin</a> — Wed May 10, 2023 9:29 am</p><hr />

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Sam.<br />Neil<br />And I’m Neil.<br />Sam<br />Your friend, Alicia, phoned and left you a message for you, Neil. She’s sorry but she has to cancel lunch today. I think she’s going with Jenny, instead.<br />Neil<br />That’s the third time this week they’ve had lunch together! Are they best friends now?<br />Sam<br />It sounds like Neil has a case of the green-eyed monster, in other words, jealousy – the fear that someone else may take something you think is yours.  Humans have struggled with jealousy for thousands of years. Jealousy damages friendships, destroys relationships, and can even become a motive for murder.<br />Neil<br />In this programme, we’ll discuss jealousy to find out happens when the green-eyed monster raises its ugly head. And, as usual, we’ll be learning some useful new vocabulary. Meanwhile, my friend Alicia will be having lunch with Jenny instead of me…<br />Sam<br />Feeling jealous is no fun. Maybe this question will take your mind off it. The expression ‘the green-eyed monster’ comes from a speech in one of William Shakespeare’s most famous plays, but which one? Is it:<br />a)    Romeo and Juliet?<br />b)    Hamlet? or,<br />c)    Othello?<br />Neil<br />I think the answer is Othello.<br />Sam<br />OK, Neil. I’ll reveal the answer later in the programme. For many people, feelings of jealousy occur in romantic relationships. Here psychologist, Dr Alex Mielke,explains whyto BBC World Service programme, CrowdScience.<br />Dr Alex Mielke<br />So you have a friend, a significant other, your parents… and you have the feeling that this relationship is threatened by someone else starting some form of relationship with them, starting a new friendship, you know, flirting with them and so on, which is different from envy, for example, which is probably the emotion that gets you to act when someone has something you want and you have to somehow get that from them – that’s when you feel envious.<br />Neil<br />Jealousy can be a problem for husbands and wives, boyfriends and girlfriends, or anyone involved in a romantic relationship. Dr Mielke uses the term, significant other, to describe any kind of romantic partner who you have a long-term relationship with.<br />Sam<br />You might feel jealous if someone flirts with your partner. Flirting is when you behave as if you are sexually attracted to someone but in a playful way rather than with serious intentions.<br />Neil<br />Dr Mielke also notes the difference between two words people often confuse: jealousy, and a similar term, envy - wanting what someone else has. You could be envious of someone’s possessions like a new car, their achievements like promotion at work, or a personal quality like being funny or good-looking.<br />Sam<br />So, jealousy involves three people – you, your loved one, and someone else - whereas envy involves just two - you and the person who has something you want. But while these emotions are easy to define, they can be very difficult to manage.<br />Neil<br />Jealousy can lead to controlling behaviour, like checking your partner’s text messages or monitoring who they see, behaviour which damages relationships. But unlike other psychological problems such as anxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorder, many do not feel brave enough to ask for help with their jealousy.<br />Sam<br />So, what can people who struggle with jealousy do? That’s the question Caroline Steel, presenter of BBC World Service programme, CrowdScience, asked clinical psychologist, Dr Johan Ahlen.<br />Caroline Steel<br />If there was sort of an ideal future for people looking for help with their jealousy, what would it be like? Could there be a pill? Or would it be a specific therapy? Or what’s kind of a realistic ideal future?<br />Dr Johan Ahlen<br />I believe that some kind of cognitive behavioural therapy where you work with decreasing this monitoring and checking behaviours like having a plan for how to do that because that's not easy. And also, at the same time increasing activities or behaviours that harmonise with how you want to become. <br />Neil<br />Unfortunately, Dr Ahlen says jealousy cannot be cured by taking a pill – medicine in the form of a small tablet that you swallow.<br />Sam<br />Instead, he recommends cognitive behavioural therapy, or CBT for short, a therapy which helps people deal with their emotions by changing how they think about things. Instead of feeling jealous that your best friend is spending time with someone else, try feeling happy that she’s made a new friend.<br />Neil<br />Good idea - plus I won’t have that horrid feeling of the green-eyed monster inside! Speaking of which, it’s time to reveal the answer to your question, Sam. <br />Sam<br />I asked which famous Shakespearian play first described jealousy as ‘the green-eyed monster’.<br />Neil<br />I said it was Othello. So, was I right?<br />Sam<br />Othello was the correct answer! Othello becomes so jealous that he murders his wife, Desdemona, before killing himself. If only he’d had some therapy! Right, let’s recap the vocabulary from this programme on the green-eyed monster, another name for jealousy.<br />Neil<br />A significant other is a wife, husband or other romantic partner who you are in a long-term relationship with.<br />Sam<br />Flirting means playfully pretending you are sexually attracted to someone.<br />Neil<br />The emotion envy means wanting what someone else has. <br />Sam<br />A pill is medicine in the form of a small tablet which you swallow.<br />Neil<br />And finally, cognitive behavioural therapy or CBT is a type of therapy where people are encouraged to change the way they think about their emotional and behavioural problems. Once again, our six minutes are up. Join us again soon for more emotional support as well as new and useful vocabulary here at 6 Minute English. Bye for now!<br />Sam<br />Bye bye!<br /><br />Q1. What images are in your mind when you hear the word ' jealousy’ and’ envy '?<br />Q2. Do you get jealous easily? Why or why not?<br />Q3. What or who are you jealous of?<br />Q4. Are you envious of someone’s possessions? What possessions are those? <br /><br /><br />Session II: How I became fluent in English on my own<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkoy6IRNEuI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkoy6IRNEuI</a><!-- m --><br />1.

Family history, lineage, heritage, and ethnicities, geographic divides, climates, social and political situations, such as poverty and wars majorly influence the food culture. The food culture is influenced by individuals or small networks and institutions, such as families, or large ones, such as societies, companies, and countries.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Different Food Cultures</span><br />Some of the more popular <span style="font-weight: bold">food cultures around the world</span> are:<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Asian food cultures:</span> Rice is a staple in Asian food culture. Hence, it is a quintessential part of the cuisine and can be found in all forms of food.<br />•<span style="font-weight: bold">Chinese </span>- Stir-fried veggies and meat and a range of meats cooked with different sauces and rice is a staple. Different regions in China, such as the Hunan, Fujian, Sichuan, and Cantonese have a different take on the same dish found throughout the country.<br />•<span style="font-weight: bold">Thai </span>- the world-famous Thai green, red, and yellow curries have made their place in the hearts of the population around the world. Their strong, spiced flavors and generous use of basil, kafir lime, lemongrass, chilies, coconut milk, mint, cilantro, and turmeric add a pop of flavor to their cuisine. Their rice noodles are equally famous.<br />•<span style="font-weight: bold">Japanese</span> - Sushis and Sashimis are Japan's gift to the world. Healthy, bite-sized rice-enriched and raw fish pieces work equally well as a quick lunch or a sit-down dinner.<br />•<span style="font-weight: bold">Indian</span> - The plethora of spices and aromas and a bounty of flavors it lends to any food makes Indian food a favorite amongst other world cuisines. Besides, it's the only cuisine that offers so much variety and flavor when it comes to a strict vegetarian diet. Also, because of the enormity and diversity of the country, the food changes every 500 kilometers. There's a lot more ethnic, regional, and street food in India.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">European food cultures:</span> The Mediterranean diet, known as the healthiest diet there is, has been around for centuries and revels in a diet rich in nuts, olive oil, fresh meat, cold cuts, fruits, and vegetables, not to mention the local wines of various regions and provinces.<br />•<span style="font-weight: bold">Greek</span> - known for its farm-fresh salads and cheeses, the Greek cuisine is also Mediterranean premier cuisine.

While hamburgers, fries, and fizzy drinks are quite popular, one cannot negate the presence of Chinese, Indian, Italian, Thai, Spanish, French, Mexican, and South African cuisines. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Relationship between Food and Culture -Why is food important to culture? </span><br />Food is not just something we eat to fill our stomachs. It is consciousness. The love, attention, and toil with which it is shopped for, prepared hours or even days before, cooked with patience, and served with love have a huge impact on how it turns out and how it affects us. People bond over cooking, ingredients, shopping markets, produce, recipes, restaurants, farming, and so much more. Food has been the cornerstone of any food culture around the world. In difficult times, like poverty and war, no matter how little, food has comforted people time and again. What was considered a poor man's food is now famous comfort food dishes around the world. Food recipes passed down from one generation to another have become the identity of families and their lineages. Foods cooked for celebrating rituals, traditions, and occasions have now become a part of rich history. It shapes their identity. It becomes important to the culture. It becomes their culture. The American anthropologist Margaret Mead famously mentioned that food is for gifting. It provides us the basis to connect with our friends and family. It is more than just plain nutrition; food when shared and 'gifted' brings people, societies, and nations closer. The expression 'to break the bread with someone' is more symbolic than literal. It comes from olden times when the bread was often harder than how it is now. As a result, people had to break it rather than just 'tear' it to eat it. While it definitely means sharing a meal with someone, it goes beyond just that. It means sharing an emotional connection, a bond with someone over a meal. Food for centuries, after all, has been bringing people together.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Cultural Heritage</span><br />Food that has been eaten for generations becomes a part of the rich cultural heritage that a region, province, state, or country enjoys. When a country or land is conquered by stronger political powers, so are its traditions, people, and foods. Obviously, the powers bring their own food with them and try to erase or modify the authentic dishes that have been the identity of that place.<br /><br />Discussions:<br />1.   Food recipes passed down from one generation to another. It cooked for celebrating rituals, traditions, and become a part of rich history and important to the culture. Do you like Asia foods or Western foods? <br />2.  Chinese foods including Roasted Duck(烤鴨), Kung Pao Chicken (宮保雞丁), Sweet and Sour Pork (糖醋排骨), Hot pot, Dim Sum, Dumplings, Ma Po Tofu(麻婆豆腐) etc. Which one do you like to eat? <br />3. Are you familiar with Thai food’s ingredients – basil (羅勒), Kafir lime(檸檬葉), cilantro(香菜), turmeric(薑黃) etc. Do you know these ingredients and have you ever used them? <br />4. There are many Japan foods and restaurants – such as ramen, Sushi or Okonomi-yaki (什錦燒). Do you like them and how often do you taste them? <br />5. Food for centuries, after all, has been bringing people together. Are there any good restaurants in Taipei that you would like to introduce to us ? <br /><br /><br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Session 2:<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Bill Gates says ChatGPT will ‘change our world’ but it doesn’t mean your job is at risk, Tristan Bove, February 11, 2023</span><br /><br />For those still unconvinced that OpenAI’s ChatGPT heralds major innovation in artificial intelligence, take it from the man who kickstarted the home computer revolution 50 years ago. The successful launch of ChatGPT in November has pushed Big Tech, including Google and Microsoft, to accelerate their A.I. research and product rollouts. This week, Google released to testers its own A.I.-assisted search engine called Bard, while Microsoft announced a new version of its own search engine Bing to be powered by a forthcoming large language model similar to ChatGPT and also developed by OpenAI. The technology behind ChatGPT, which enables the chatbot to provide detailed information and write about complex topics, could pave the way for major changes in search engines and in-office apps, and help with everyday tasks. But ChatGPT’s wide range of uses also has people worried about their jobs. The chatbot can write, compose, and problem solve in response to a prompt in a matter of seconds. While it isn’t always accurate, it leaves technical writers, data analysts, and coders nervous about their future.<br />But ChatGPT isn’t yet a risk to our livelihoods, according to Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder and tech investor. “Until now, artificial intelligence could read and write, but could not understand the content,” Gates said in a podcast interview with German business news outlet Handelsblatt. ChatGPT, he said, has shown us what A.I. is capable of, and its effect on the workplace will be extremely positive. “This will change the world,” Gates said. Gates added that while A.I. still makes big mistakes, it could nevertheless enhance office work by improving employee efficiency and productivity. “We find ourselves with a tool that can make even white collar type jobs far more efficient—looking at invoices, medical claims, or, you know, writing letters. Reading and writing are now within A.I.’s capabilities and that will have a very broad impact,” he said.<br /><br /><br />Discussions:<br />1.ChatGPT is capable of carrying out an intelligent conversation with a human and can input queries like to a friend. What kind of questions you may like to ask ChatGPT?<br />2.It can generate Email, search engine, write emails, poems and scripts, essays, solve tricky Math problems, create original jokes, writing music, answer questions etc. Do you think it will make our work more efficiently?<br />3.Are you afraid that it might take our human being’s job in the future and what kind of jobs may be replaced?<br />4.Do you think ChatGPT is another revolution to our life?

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Sam.<br />Neil<br />And I’m Neil.<br />Sam<br />Come on, Neil, let’s make a start! I’ve got a deadline to meet today, and I haven’t finished my work yet!<br />Neil<br />Let me guess, it’s because you delayed, and delayed, and put your work off until the last minute - as usual! You’re a real procrastinator, Sam – someone who keeps delaying things that need to be done.<br />Sam<br />What can I say? I work better when a deadline is approaching.<br />Neil<br />I see, but did you know that that people who procrastinate have higher levels of stress and lower wellbeing? Procrastination is also linked with lower financial and career success, so there's a lot of reasons not to do it.<br />Sam<br />In this programme, we’re discussing procrastination – the act of delaying things that must be done until later, often because they’re difficult, boring or unpleasant. And, as usual, we’ll be learning some new vocabulary along the way.<br />Neil<br />So, without wasting any more time, I have a question for you, Sam. The fact that procrastinating, or putting things off, is bad for us doesn’t stop people doing it. According to recent research by DePaul University in Chicago, what percentage of people procrastinate so much that it interferes with their day-to-day life? Is it:<br />a)    10 percent?<br />b)    20 percent?  or,<br />c)    30 percent?<br />Sam<br />I’ll guess that around 10 percent of people have a serious procrastination problem.<br />Neil<br />OK, Sam. We’ll find out the answer later in the programme. Sam is certainly not alone in putting things off until the last minute. Here’s Ella al-Shamahi, presenter of BBC Radio 4’s, Why Do We Do That? talking to the comedian, Eshaan Akbar, about his procrastination habit:<br />Ella al-Shamahi<br />Would you say, Eshaan, that you're a procrastinator?<br />Eshaan Akbar<br />I am a serial procrastinator without a shadow of a doubt.<br />Ella al-Shamahi<br />Why? Why do you think you procrastinate?<br />Eshaan Akbar<br />Over the years, I've told myself that I procrastinate because I work better under pressure. That's what I've told myself.<br />Sam<br />Eshaan thinks that he is a procrastinator without a shadow of a doubt, a phrase which is used to emphasise that you are completely certain of something.<br />Neil<br />Eshaan also says that, like Sam, he works better under pressure, when he feels stressed or anxious because of having too much to do. But maybe, also like Sam, Eshaan has a problem organising his workload and managing his time.<br />Sam<br />Hang on, Neil, my time management skills are OK, thank you! With me, it’s more of an emotional response – I see a mountain of work, feel threatened, and think, ‘how on earth will I finish all that?!’<br />Neil<br />What Sam says is supported by a theory of human evolution which explains how putting things off is an emotional response. Back when we were living in caves, life was dangerous and short, and our ancestors were impulsive – they acted suddenly, on instinct, without thinking about the consequences of what they were doing. Back then, being impulsive was a good thing, but in modern life, with work goals and deadlines, when we are impulsive and get distracted, we procrastinate. So rather than being a problem with time management, Sam should blame her caveman ancestors who acted on impulse.<br />Sam<br />Hmm... Let’s listen again to comedian Eshaan Akbar talking how he feels when he procrastinates:<br />Eshaan Akbar<br />A lot of stuff you read about procrastination focuses on the time management element of it… I probably got a better sense that for me it seems very squarely around the emotional aspect of it. Perhaps I get more emotional gratification from doing it last minute. And, I need to understand why I prefer that over the calm serenity of getting things done with oodles of time on my hands.<br />Neil<br />In the same way that our ancestors felt good living on impulse, Eshaan thinks he gets gratification -a feeling of pleasure and satisfaction – from doing things at the last minute. What he doesn’t understand is why he prefers to work under pressure, instead of finishing calmly with oodles,or lots of,time.<br />Sam<br />Unlike Eshaan, I’d rather finish my work feeling relaxed, but there never seems to be enough time.<br />Neil<br />Well, breaking down the task into smaller stages also breaks down the level of threat you feel from your workload. Also, forgiving yourself for procrastinating in the past seems helpful in avoiding procrastinating in the future. So, forgive yourself and start making changes, Sam, before you end up like the timewasters in my question: what percentage of people procrastinate so much that it interferes with day-to-day life.<br />Sam<br />Well, I guessed it was 10 percent.<br />Neil<br />Which was… the wrong answer, I’m afraid. In fact around 20 percent of us have a procrastination habit so strong it makes life difficult. Okay, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned from this programme on procrastination – delaying, or putting off,  doing things until later, often because they’re difficult, unpleasant or boring.<br />Sam<br />The phrase without a shadow of a doubt is used to emphasise that you are completely certain of something.<br />Neil<br />If you’re under pressure, you feel stressed or anxious because of having too much to do.<br />Sam<br />Impulsive behaviour is sudden and spontaneous, done without thinking about the consequences.<br />Neil<br />Gratification means a feeling of pleasure and satisfaction.<br />Sam<br />And finally, when you have oodles of something, you have a lot of a very large amount of something pleasant…. like time, which once again we’ve run out of. I’m rushing off to finish my work, Neil, but remember to make time to join us again soon, here at 6 Minute English. Bye for now!<br />Neil<br />Bye!<br /><br />Q1. Are you a procrastinator? If yes, what is your procrastination habit? If not, do you think why people do it?<br />Q2. Do you delay things that must be done until later because they’re difficult, boring, or unpleasant? Are there any other reasons people leave their work until the last minute?<br />Q3. Do you agree that procrastinators have higher levels of stress, lower wellbeing, lower financial and career success? <br />Q4. We do know that procrastinating, or putting things off, is bad for us. Why do people not stop doing it?<br />Q5. If people procrastinate so much, will it interfere with their day-to-day life? Are there any examples?<br />Session II:<br />Taiwan's indoor mask rules relaxed with 8 exceptions<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815505">https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4815505</a><!-- m --><br />NT$15,000 fine will still be levied for failing to wear masks in 8 indoor settings<br />By Keoni Everington, Taiwan News, Staff Writer<br />2023/02/20 10:07<br />TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan largely lifted its indoor mask mandate on Monday (Feb. 20), with the exception of eight indoor settings, where fines of up to NT$15,000 (US$493) will still be imposed on violators.<br />The Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) on Monday officially relaxed the indoor mask regulations, finally allowing everyone to show their &quot;true face.&quot; Masks will still be required for medical institutions, care institutions, senior care institutions, long-term care facilities, veterans' homes, children and youth services, care institutions for physically or mentally disabled people, and public transportation and specified means of transport.<br />If people in these eight locations must eat, drink, take photos, or undergo medical treatment, the CECC said they can temporarily remove their masks until these activities are completed.<br />In a Sunday (Feb. 19) press release, the MOTC said masks must still be worn on public transport.
