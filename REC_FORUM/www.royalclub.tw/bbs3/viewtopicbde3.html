				<div class="content">(12/8) 21 people, including senior members and new  friends, participated in  Royal club year end party &amp; installation.<br />1.we  enjoyed delicious food and sang interesting songs together in 星聚點.  We found many talented singers in our club. <br />2.We had a ceremony to  appreciate the devotion of  Presidents Jason Tang &amp; Shuman ,P.R. teams to the club in 2018. We also introduced and welcomed the 2019 team led by Morris &amp; Danny Lin. It is important to have volunteers to continue to support and manage this club.<br />3.Every participant made an impressive English speech.  We all agreed English is very  important, so we appreciated the funder, William, established this club 19 years ago,  making us have a good platform to practice English, enrich our knowledge, and meet friends.  We all sincerely hoped this club can last forever.<br />In conclusion, we had a wonderful and unforgettable party, so most of us will keep attending the regular meetings, and looked forward to next outing.<br />[img][/<div class="inline-attachment">
