It has driven humanity forward and allowed people to come together in ways previous generations would never have believed. <br /><br />But the internet has enabled people to reach one another in malicious ways too. It has allowed scammers, hackers, and bullies access to more victims as well as allowing perpetrators to hide behind veritable anonymity. This article will focus on one kind of negativity that has increased on the internet: online shaming. <br /><br />Digital Interface, Real Shame <br />Online shaming, generally speaking, is a form of vigilantism in which people are publicly humiliated – usually over social media – for private actions or without wanting public attention. <br /><br />It can often take the form of a digital lynch-mob destroying reputations and careers because of perceived offenses.<br /><br />Online shaming can happen in many different ways. Body-shaming – one of the most prevalent in this day and age – consists of pointing out perceived abnormalities in physical appearance, like weight, and indicating that they stem from poor lifestyle habits or choices (i.e fat = lazy or skinny = anorexic). Other examples include mom-shaming, revenge shaming, or even shaming people because of their sexual orientation, race, or religion. <br /><br />One poignant example is the story of Molly Lensing who was the victim of a massive online shaming campaign. She was spotted on her phone after having placed her infant child on the floor in an airport terminal. The picture offered neither context nor explanation. It was captioned with a quote that indicated Molly was a terrible mother who preferred to play on her phone than pay attention to her daughter. <br /><br />But in an interview with Today, Lensing clarified that there was crucial context missing from the image. Her flight had been delayed for 20 hours and her daughter, Anastasia, “had been held or in her carrier for many hours. She needed to stretch.” She further explained that she was on her phone to keep her family updated with her arrival time.<br /><br />Online Shaming Consequences<br />Targets of online shaming mobs often have to deal with major financial, professional, and emotional fallout. Victims like Justine Sacco, Lindsey Stone, and YouTube star Logan Paul all lost their jobs and reputations as a result of online shaming. <br /><br />But often the damage can extend beyond career loss. Teenagers were surveyed about their experience with online shaming and expressed the following:<br /><br />41% said they felt sad, helpless and depressed<br />26% felt completely alone<br />18% experienced suicidal thoughts<br />21% felt too ashamed to go to school<br />38% don’t tell their parents they are being harassed online<br />In his book So, You’ve Been Publicly Shamed, journalist Jon Ronson explores online shaming as well as shares his own experience as a shaming victim. He writes,<br /><br />“A life had been ruined. What was it for: just some social media drama? I think our natural disposition as humans is to plod along until we get old and stop. But with social media, we’ve created a stage for constant artificial high drama. Every day a new person emerges as a magnificent hero or a sickening villain. It’s all very sweeping, and not the way we actually are as people.”<br /><br />Question<br />1.	In your opinion, how to define online shaming?<br />2.	Have you ever meet someone attack you or your friends on line? <br />3.	How can we protect us by shaming online?<br />4.	Why the online shaming looks like more common? What is going on our society?<br /><br /><br />Schizophrenia Symptoms and Coping Tips<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/mental-disorders/schizophrenia-signs-and-symptoms.htm">https://www.helpguide.org/articles/ment ... mptoms.htm</a><!-- m --><br /><br />What is schizophrenia or paranoid schizophrenia?<br />Schizophrenia is a challenging brain disorder that often makes it difficult to distinguish between what is real and unreal, to think clearly, manage emotions, relate to others, and function normally. It affects the way a person behaves, thinks, and sees the world.<br /><br />The most common form is paranoid schizophrenia, or schizophrenia with paranoia as it’s often called. People with paranoid schizophrenia have an altered perception of reality. They may see or hear things that don’t exist, speak in confusing ways, believe that others are trying to harm them, or feel like they’re being constantly watched. This can cause relationship problems, disrupt normal daily activities like bathing, eating, or running errands, and lead to alcohol and drug abuse in an attempt to self-medicate.<br /><br />Many people with schizophrenia withdraw from the outside world, act out in confusion and fear, and are at an increased risk of attempting suicide, especially during psychotic episodes, periods of depression, and in the first six months after starting treatment.<br />Early warning signs of schizophrenia<br />In some people, schizophrenia appears suddenly and without warning. But for most, it comes on slowly, with subtle warning signs and a gradual decline in functioning, long before the first severe episode. Often, friends or family members will know early on that something is wrong, without knowing exactly what.<br /><br />In this early phase of schizophrenia, you may seem eccentric, unmotivated, emotionless, and reclusive to others. You may start to isolate yourself, begin neglecting your appearance, say peculiar things, and show a general indifference to life. You may abandon hobbies and activities, and your performance at work or school can deteriorate.<br /><br />The most common early warning signs include:<br />Depression, social withdrawal<br />Hostility or suspiciousness, extreme reaction to criticism<br />Deterioration of personal hygiene<br />Flat, expressionless gaze<br />Inability to cry or express joy or inappropriate laughter or crying<br />Oversleeping or insomnia; forgetful, unable to concentrate<br />Odd or irrational statements; strange use of words or way of speaking<br />While these warning signs can result from a number of problems—not just schizophrenia—they are cause for concern. When out-of-the-ordinary behavior is causing problems in your life or the life of a loved one, seek medical advice. If schizophrenia or another mental problem is the cause, getting treatment early will help.<br /><br />Question<br />1.	What is Schizophrenia in your thought?<br />2.	Have you ever meet this kind of person?<br />3.	What is main reason that people get this disease? Do you think the drugs can cure it?<br />4.	Do you agree a Schizophrenia person is guilty free?<br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00 ~ 7:30 pm greetings &amp; free talk<br />7:30 ~ 8:15 pm guests introduced &amp; first session discussion<br />8:15 ~ 8:45 pm presentation, sharing the article &amp; other experiences<br />8:45 ~ 9:30 pm second session discussion<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven,<br />板橋民生路二段237 號,<br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30,<br />a minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
