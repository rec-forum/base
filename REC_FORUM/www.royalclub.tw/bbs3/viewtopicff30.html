A child today is three times more likely to go to hospital for falling out of bed than for falling out of a tree. This is about saying, “what kind of childhood experience do we want our children to have?”.’<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />1)	What is something you really miss from your childhood activities? Did you like climbing trees? Why very few kids are engaging in outdoor activities nowadays?<br />2)	Children are more likely to be hurt falling out of bed than out of a tree. What do you think are the causes that result in this phenomenon?<br />3)	Trying to recall your outdoor activities in your childhood, what did you remember? In retrospect, what today's children will remember about their childhood activities when they grow up?<br />4)	To prevent future generation experiencing great risks than we have suffered, what our government and we have to do in a different way?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Session II: What does Hothouse Earth mean? Global warming, temperature rises and the events leading us to a tipping point</span><br /><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/6958898/hothouse-earth-global-warming-temperature-rises-tipping-point/" class="postlink">https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/6958898/hothouse-earth-global-warming-temperature-rises-tipping-point/</a><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">POINT OF NO RETURN </span><br />What does Hothouse Earth mean? Global warming, temperature rises and the events leading us to a tipping point<br />Runaway 'domino effect' could make parts of the Earth uninhabitable even if we meet greenhouse gas targets, scientists warn<br /><br />By Felix Allen<br />7th August 2018<br /><br />HUMANITY faces catastrophe from runaway global warming even if we meet targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions, scientists have warned.<br />Ten tipping point dangers could spark a domino-effect cascade of disaster, creating irreversible &quot;Hothouse Earth&quot; conditions. Here's what we know.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What is Hothouse Earth?</span><br /><br />A group of scientists have delivered a grim warning in a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.<br />It spells out how natural processes that normally protect us from the effects of climate change could turn against us and make the problem far worse.<br /><br />Forests, oceans and soil permafrost have absorbed huge quantities of carbon dioxide and methane, a more potent greenhouse gas.<br /><br />But they could release billions of tons of the gases if global average temperatures rise to just 2C above pre-industrial levels - the maximum in the 2015 Paris Agreement signed by 196 nations.<br /><br />Linked processes would generate a &quot;positive feedback&quot; loop, amplifying and accelerating the effects as the earth warms by 5C or even more.<br />The Amazon rainforest is a huge carbon sink but could start pumping out greenhouse gases as it dies back in a warmer climate <br />The study warns: &quot;The Earth System may be approaching a planetary threshold that could lock in a continuing, rapid pathway towards much hotter conditions - Hothouse Earth.&quot;<br /><br />Beyond this tipping point, any actions by humans to reduce global warming would be futile.<br /><br />Temperatures would rise to higher than at any time in the past 1.2million years, they say.<br /><br />Seas could rise more than 80ft and deadly heatwaves, droughts, famines and superstorms would make much of the planet uninhabitable.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What are the ten factors that lead to Hothouse Earth?</span><br /><br />The study identifies ten climate change processes that could combine to bring about a global catastrophe.<br />Temperature rises of between 1C and 5C would trip these natural processes &quot;from friend to foe&quot;.<br /><br />They are:<br />	*  reduced northern hemisphere snow cover<br />	*  loss of Arctic summer sea ice<br />	*  reduced Antarctic sea ice<br />	*  melting polar ice sheets<br />	*  thawing permafrost<br />	*  the release of methane trapped on the ocean floor<br />	*  weakening land and ocean carbon sinks<br />	*  increased carbon dioxide production by ocean bacteria<br />	*  Amazon rainforest die-back<br />	*  coniferous forest die-back<br /><br />&quot;These tipping elements can potentially act like a row of dominoes,&quot; said co-author Prof Johan Rockström of the Stockholm Resilience Centre in Sweden.<br /><br />For instance, less snow and ice would mean more of the sun's rays are absorbed (because ice is like a mirror that bounces heat back into space).<br /><br />The extent of Arctic sea ice has dropped by 40 per cent in four decades and could vanish altogether one year in four, scientists warn.<br /><br />Rising temperatures would weaken &quot;carbon sinks&quot; in the land and seas that currently absorb around half of carbon pollution.<br /><br />Forests are already shrinking and oceans are thought to be close to the point where they cannot absorb any more CO2.<br /><br />Warming of 3C - only around 2C higher than at present - would kill around 40 per cent of the Amazon rainforest, releasing billions of tons of carbon.<br /><br />The vast forests in Canada increased their biomas for much of the 20th century - locking in carbon - but have been declining since the 1970s thanks to climate-linked fires and insect swarms.<br /><br />Permafrost in the vast frozen plains of Russia and Canada contain CO2 and methane equivalent to 15 years of human emissions.<br /><br />It could be released as the ground thaws, accelerating warming further.<br /><br />Similarly, crystals of methane hydrates in the ocean floor are thought to be vulnerable to global warming.<br /><br />Scientists think they have been responsible for periods of rapid warming in geological history, leading to mass extinctions.<br /><br />More severe warming would eventually melt the massive polar ice caps in Greenland and the Antarctic, raising sea levels by up 25m.<br />This would swamp most of the world's major cities and the agricultural land that feeds them.<br /><br />Scientists have said in this scenario the planet would be able to sustain no more than a billion people, down from more than seven billion now.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Can anything be done to stop it?</span><br /><br />In 2015 governments of the world committed to keeping temperature rises below 2C of warming above pre-industrial levels, and to strive to keep below 1.5C.<br /><br />Even that might not be enough if the analysis by the team of experts is correct.<br /><br />Prof Johan Rockström told the BBC: &quot;What we are saying is that when we reach 2C of warming, we may be at a point where we hand over the control mechanism to Planet Earth herself.<br /><br />&quot;We are the ones in control right now, but once we go past 2C, we see that the Earth system tips over from being a friend to a foe.&quot;<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />1)	According to the articles, what does “Hothouse Earth” mean? And what are the factors that lead to it.<br />2)	What is the grim warning that scientists deliver in this article?<br />How can natural processes protect us from the effect of climate change? If the natural processes no longer protect us, will that amplify the problems?<br />3)	Why is the Amazon rainforest not absorbing as much greenhouse gases as in the past? How does this lead to Global warming?<br />4)	What’s your feeling when you read this: Seas could rise more than 80ft and deadly heatwaves, droughts, famines and superstorms would make much of the planet uninhabitable.<br />5)	Are you anxious about Taiwan’s shrinking forests being gradually replaced by high buildings? How can we do to balance between social development and Global warming?<br />6)	Rapid warming can lead to rising sea levels &amp; mass extinctions. As individual, what can we do to slow the effects of Global warming?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Agenda</span><br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />8:10 ~ 8:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:25 ~ 8:30pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:30 ~9:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~9:30pm Concluding remarks/feedback from newcomers<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The meeting place of Thursday:</span><br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第一區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
