			<div class="content">Session I:<br />How to Learn All the Vocabulary You Need<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.eslpod.com/eslpod_blog/2020/06/30/how-to-learn-all-the-vocabulary-you-need/">https://www.eslpod.com/eslpod_blog/2020 ... -you-need/</a><!-- m --><br />One question I get frequently on email is: “Do you talk about phrasal verbs in your lessons?”<br /><br />A phrasal verb is sometimes called a two-word verb, such as “to put down” or “to get out” or “to kick (someone) out.”<br /><br />English has lots of these phrasal or two-word verbs, and they can be very confusing to people trying to acquire (learn) the language.<br /><br />Let me respond to this question in two ways.<br /><br />First, many people want a “systematic” or structured review of all of the most important phrasal verbs in English.<br /><br />I understand this desire to be thorough and organized in your learning.<br /><br />But that’s not the best way to pick up new vocabulary.<br /><br />Yes, you could try to memorize verbs the way many English courses try to teach you, one word at a time.<br /><br />But that one-by-one approach has been found by several research studies to be the least efficient use of your time, the worst use of your time.<br /><br />Why is this so?<br /><br />To understand why trying to memorize vocabulary is not a good idea, you have to understand a little about how we improve our language proficiency.<br /><br />I don’t have time to cover everything on a blog post, but I created a five-page, Special Report that explains it. You can get that for FREE here. <br /><br />If you haven’t read this, get it now and read it.<br /><br />Here’s the short answer: You pick up English most effectively when you are focused on understanding what you are listening to or reading, not when you “study” or try to memorize individual parts of English (vocabulary, grammar, spelling, and so forth).<br /><br />Listening and reading. Those are your keys to success in English.<br /><br />For listening, there’s nothing better than our own Unlimited English membership , of course! We have more than 500 hours of interesting audio to listen to.<br /><br />For reading, select anything you’d like, as long as (a) you can understand most of it (over 90%), and (b) you enjoy reading it.<br /><br />If you don’t enjoy it, you won’t keep reading it!<br /><br />Reading has been shown in studies to be up to 10 times more effective than traditional vocabulary teaching, such as memorizing words.<br /><br />Let me repeat that: Reading is up to 10 times faster than any other typical approach to expanding (growing; increasing) your vocabulary, including flash cards, computer programs, and websites with lots of “vocabulary” exercises.<br /><br />You don’t have to try to remember new words when you read. In fact, stopping to write down a new word or forcing yourself to “memorize” it will only slow you down.<br /><br />Just keep reading.<br /><br />Over time, with enough listening and reading, you’ll pick up all the vocabulary you need.<br /><br />Second, we DO talk about phrasal verbs, in almost every one of our Daily and Cultural English lessons!<br /><br />For example, in Daily English 322 – Picking Up a Rental Car , we talk about all of these phrasal verbs: to pick up, to take advantage, and to stick to (something).<br /><br />In our Cultural English 112 lesson , we talk about the phrasal verbs to cover up and to carry out.<br /><br />Even more phrasal verbs are typically found in our Learning Guide under the sections What Else Does it Mean? and Cultural Note.<br /><br />We talk about two to three phrasal verbs on nearly every one of our 1800+ lessons.<br /><br />So if you want to know all of the phrasal verbs in English, now you know what to do: read a lot, and listen to the lessons that come with our Unlimited English membership .<br /><br />Q1. How important is vocabulary for learning English?<br />Q2. Do you agree that Listening and reading is the best way to pick up new vocabulary?<br />Q3. Would you like to try the way from the article to learn vocabulary? Why or Why not?<br />Q4. What is your way to learn vocabulary?<br /><br />Session II:<br />New passport design offers practical and diplomatic benefits<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4001972">https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4001972</a><!-- m --><br /><br />KAOHSIUNG (Taiwan News) – A few years ago, I flew into Maastricht in the Netherlands with my Taiwanese wife and brother-in-law. After an uneventful flight, we passed through the small and quiet arrivals terminal and reached passport control.<br /><br />&quot;Why don’t you have a visa?&quot; my travel companions were asked. &quot;All visitors from China need a visa to enter the Netherlands.&quot;<br /><br />They both gave a weary sigh. As regular travelers, it was an experience they had encountered many times before.<br /><br />But this time, despite explaining the Republic of China (Taiwan) was a separate country to the People’s Republic of China (China) and that, as signatories to the Schengen Agreement, Taiwanese do not need a visa to enter EU countries, the border agents were having none of it. We were swiftly escorted to the airport police station and their passports were taken away while further checks were carried out.<br /><br />A long wait ensued, something both of them grimly accepted as par for the course. Half an hour or so later, passports were returned, embarrassed apologies were made, and we were all welcomed to the Netherlands and told to enjoy our stay.<br /><br />This incident occurred at a time when Taiwan passports only said &quot;Republic of China&quot; on the cover. I have spoken to a number of well-traveled Taiwanese associates since then and am reliably informed that such incidents are still far from uncommon.<br /><br />Fresh designs<br /><br />It is frustrating and embarrassing for Taiwanese people to be treated in such a way when arriving in a country. It is profoundly wrong that they should be inconvenienced and humiliated because of the myriad of failings of their totalitarian neighbor.<br /><br />This is no doubt why so many Taiwanese people were elated when the new passport design was unveiled this week. The design places the English word &quot;Taiwan&quot; front and center, in a huge font, while the name Republic of China is relegated to a small font circling the white sun logo.<br /><br />It is a relatively modest change, but one that should ensure the type of incident we faced in Maastricht becomes an extremely rare occurrence.<br /><br />As with all decisions of this kind, there has been some criticism. The KMT threw out a weak line about revisionism and claimed it was a partisan decision, overlooking the clear practical benefits the change will bring to many Taiwanese travelers.<br /><br />Others argued the government could have been more ambitious and pointed to the New Power Party’s recent competition for a new passport cover design. This garnered some beautiful and highly creative designs, including my personal favorite, &quot;The Diverse Land,&quot; which used colorful dots to draw a map of Taiwan.<br /><br />While there was plenty of merit to these designs, the government also has to bear in mind the significant diplomatic sensitivities that surround Taiwan's national identity. Even if they have clear personal views, as a responsible national administration, they still have to tread the diplomatic tightrope.<br /><br />De-sinicization<br /><br />The new design they have come up with makes subtle and diplomatic changes. The fact the country’s full official name, Republic of China, remains on the passport in large traditional Mandarin characters at the top of the cover and only the English wording has been altered, should satisfy Taiwanese of all political persuasions.<br /><br />Indeed, the weakness of the KMT critique of the new design is a clear indicator of what a good job the government has made of the changes. This is a practical design intended to ensure that border agents and people around the world are clear that they are looking at a passport from Taiwan and not China.<br /><br />It is hard to see how this design will not achieve this. It is part of a strategy from the government to create a brand for Taiwan that is clearly distinct from China and makes it far easier for Taiwanese to identify as Taiwanese both at home and abroad.<br /><br />This is vitally important, especially at a time when the goggles are coming off and many people around the world are starting to see the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) for the totalitarian, human-rights-abusing, destabilizing, and dangerous regime that it is.<br /><br />Now it is time to turn to China Airlines and ensure that Taiwan’s national carrier has a name that recognizes its true origins. Failure to do so will see its business start to struggle as the process of de-sinicization begins to take hold across the globe.<br /><br />Q1. What is your experience with using a passport going abroad? Have you gotten any trouble?<br />Q2. Does the new passport design offer any practical or diplomatic benefits? What are they?<br />Q3. Is any need for modification in the design of the new passport? If yes, what is that? If not, why not?<br />Q4. What do you think about the issue of China Airlines changing its name?<br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00 ~ 7:30 pm greetings &amp; free talk<br />7:30 ~ 8:15 pm guests introduced &amp; first session discussion<br />8:15 ~ 8:45 pm presentation, sharing the article &amp; other experiences<br />8:45 ~ 9:30 pm second session discussion<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven,<br />板橋民生路二段237 號,<br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30,<br />a minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
