Three Modern Theories on Sleep,/Why Scandinavians Are So Good At English(Host:Amy)<br /><br />Article1:<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Why Do We Dream? Three Modern Theories on Sleep,</span> By Mark Leary, Ph.D., Duke University<br />Why do we dream? Modern theories of dreams suggest that dreams are functional—that they do something useful for us. One functional theory suggests that dreams help people to solve personal problems, to find solutions to things in life that are bothering them.<br /><br />The Problem-Solving Explanation of Why We Dream - So, if we are struggling with problems at work or in a relationship, our dreams explore these problems as we sleep and sometimes hit upon a solution for us. When people say that they are going to “sleep on” a problem, they mean that they hope that an answer will come to them while they’re sleeping. The “problem-solving explanation” for why we dream sounds quite plausible, but it doesn’t really square with a good deal of research either. For example, less than half of the dreams that people report have any connection, however remote, to the events they experienced the previous day, and even far fewer seem to have anything to do with people’s current problems. Furthermore, the fact that people recall only a very small percentage of their dreams—perhaps as low as 1 percent—also argues against the problem-solving theory. It wouldn’t make much sense to have a process that helped us figure out solutions to our problems but that didn’t let us remember the solutions that dreaming provided! And, if dreams help us with our problems, then it would seem that people who remember their dreams would be at a great advantage in life compared to people who don’t recall many of their dreams each night. But research doesn’t show differences in well-being between people who do and do not remember their dreams. People who recall more of their dreams don’t seem to resolve their personal problems more effectively. So, although there’s plenty of evidence that many dreams do reflect our daily problems, there’s not much support for the idea that dreaming helps us figure out useful solutions.<br /><br />The Cleanup Explanation for Dreaming - Other theories of dreaming focus on what the brain is doing when people dream, and these explanations don’t require that people remember their dreams in order for the process to be beneficial. For example, one theory suggests that dreams are involved in the process of “cleaning up” recent memories and other clutter from the mind. I have a program on my computer that I run from time to time that deletes redundant files, clears out fragments of files I don’t need any more, erases traces of Internet surfing, and generally cleans up the clutter on my hard drive so that it operates more efficiently. In the same way, some experts suggest that while we sleep each night, this kind of cleaning operation occurs in the brain. The images in our dreams are just snippets of memories that are being scanned and evaluated for deletion, thereby cleaning up the mind to prepare for the next day. Like the other theories, the cleanup explanation makes sense, but not everything that we know about dreaming supports it. As I mentioned, only about half of our dreams involve anything related to our recent experiences, so it’s not clear that our dreams reflect recent memories that are being scanned and deleted.And, in addition, the cleanup explanation would seem to predict that our dreams would be composed of little piecemeal snippets of memories, but they usually aren’t. Dreams often have an internally consistent story line that doesn’t have any obvious connection to anything that actually happened to us recently.<br /><br /> Why We Dream: The Consolidation Theory  - A similar explanation known as consolidation theory suggests that dreams are involved in the storage of memories from the previous day. When we talked about forgetting, I mentioned that memories undergo a process of consolidation that helps to store them in long-term memory. And some researchers believe that dreaming occurs each night during the consolidation process.This is another explanation in which the content of a dream is just a by-product of brain activity that’s occurring as memories are consolidated. This explanation has many of the same problems as the cleanup theory. When researchers analyze the content of people’s dreams, they don’t often seem to involve actual memories like the theory would predict. Well, as you’re starting to see, researchers have offered many reasonable explanations of what dreaming is all about, but none of them are entirely consistent with the data that research has provided about sleep and dreaming. Perhaps that means that we haven’t yet uncovered the real purpose of dreaming, or maybe it means that dreaming doesn’t actually have a function, or maybe we’re asking the wrong questions. Another approach to understanding dreaming is to examine the content of people’s dreams. People tend to dream about certain topics far more than other topics. Most people have had dreams of being naked or dressed inappropriately in public, or running in terror from something that was chasing them. But not many of us have had dreams of doing pushups in an airplane or picking grapes. Maybe that tells us something. <br /><br />Discussions:                                                                       <br />1. Do you often make dreams while sleeping? Do you still remember the dreams after waking   up ? <br />2. What kind of dreams you make most, being chased by someone, no places to hide while earthquake or unable to answer to the tests paper etc.? Do you know the meaning of the dreams ? <br />3. Have you ever dreamed that you were peeing in the toilet? Right after waking up, you realized that you did have the urge to pee? <br />4.  Do you believe, “ What you think about in the day, you will dream of it at night.” ?<br /><br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Article2:<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Why Scandinavians Are So Good At English</span>, David Nikel , Feb 15, 2019,<br /><br />Swedes have the best non-native English skills in the world, according to the eighth edition of the EF English Proficiency Index. Sweden’s Scandinavian siblings Norway and Denmark also place in the top five. Of course, anyone who’s visited Sweden, Norway or Denmark won’t be surprised by the findings. While there are plenty of problems visiting the region – not least the epic price tags – communication isn’t one of them. Norwegian, Swedish and Danish all have their roots in Old Norse and a speaker of one has a default capability to at least understand the other two languages. But the Scandinavians’ language ability doesn’t stop there. Virtually all are fluent in English too.<br /> <br />A happy family<br />To the untrained eye, English and the Scandinavian languages may not seem to have that much in common, yet the truth is quite different. All are members of the Germanic language family, itself a branch of the Indo-European language family spoken natively by more than 500 million people. While there are significant variations, all the languages share some important linguistic features that results in familiarity. For example, the way verbs are conjugated in English is similar to Swedish, Norwegian and Danish, but very different from the Romance languages like Italian and Spanish that have their roots in Latin.<br /> <br />The use of loan words<br /> <br />Both English and the Scandinavian languages have lent each other many words over the years. We have Old Norse and the Vikings to thank for words such as ski, skull, knife, cake and my personal favorite, berserk. The English vocabulary is one of the biggest in the world with an estimated 750,000 words. That’s orders of magnitude bigger than the Scandinavian languages. When a Swede, Dane, or Norwegian needs to describe something that a local word won’t cover, chances are they will simply use an English word. Some idioms and phrases have even crept their way into everyday use across Scandinavia, especially in advertising.<br /> <br />They start young                                                <br />English is taught in Scandinavian schools from a young age. As soon as children have mastered reading and writing their native tongue, English is introduced. The age varies by country and region but generally speaking, every student will have undergone at least a year of formal English language education by the age of ten.<br /> <br />Cultural immersion  <br />But by the time Scandinavian kids reach that age, most are already quite familiar with English. Young Scandis have always been exposed to a lot of international content, but now the likes of YouTube and Netflix have made English entertainment more accessible than ever before. Turn on a Norwegian TV channel and the chances are, you'll be hearing an English language show with Norwegian subtitles. Unlike many other countries, English shows are almost never dubbed. Whether a Scandinavian speaks English with a British or American accent has a lot to do with what kind of TV they prefer!                 <br /> <br />A region of explorers   <br />Ever since the days of the great explorers Roald Amundsen and Thor Heyerdahl, Scandinavians have been great travelers. Today, high salaries and generous vacation allowances allow most locals to take more than one vacation every year while cheap flights tempt many visitors over to London for weekends breaks. <br /> <br />A professional skill   <br />Perhaps it’s that inner-explorer, but even after almost a decade of formal English language education, many Scandinavians take things a step further by studying abroad. Whatever subject they’re studying, it’s highly likely to involve immersion in an English language environment. As globalization continues at pace, English is seen as a critical skill for business. The British Council reports that by 2020, two billion people will be studying the language. Entrepreneurs are encouraged to “think global first” and buoyed by the success stories of the likes of Spotify, many are doing just that. This focus on English in business isn’t a new phenomenon. The person behind the wildly successful English language immersion company EF Education First is not British nor American, rather a Swede! Bertil Hult began sending Swedish students to Brighton way back in 1965 and his company now works with students and adults from all across the globe who want to immerse themselves in English. <br /> <br />Discussions –<br />The three Scandinavian countries are not big ; however, the per capital income of Sweden (US$ 57,975.-) , Norway (US$92,556.-) and Denmark (US$65,147.-) are all above US$ 55,000 ?Do you know the main reasons?<br />Do you know what kind of products that the Scandinavian countries export, respectively?<br />Sweden has a total population of 10.3 million, Norway 5 million and Denmark 5.82 million. Are interested in visiting those countries?<br />Comparing with other countries, why they can speak English so well ? <br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Agenda<br />7:00 ~ 7:30 pm greetings &amp; free talk<br />7:30 ~ 8:15 pm guests introduced &amp; first session discussion<br />8:15 ~ 8:45 pm presentation, sharing the article &amp; other experiences<br />8:45 ~ 9:30 pm second session discussion<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven,<br />板橋民生路二段237 號,<br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30,<br />a minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
