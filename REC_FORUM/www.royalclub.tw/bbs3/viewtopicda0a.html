			<div class="content"><span style="color: #FF0000">*** Removal Notice ***<br />Thursday gathering of Royal Club is relocated to Ikari 怡客咖啡, 台北市衡陽路116號<br /></span><br /><br />Session 1<br />Home care vs. nursing home<br />When the time comes to decide how to help an elderly loved one through those difficult days when they aren't physically able to care for themselves, the decision can be a difficult one. How do you know what's right for the senior in your life? By understanding the benefits and drawbacks of both home care and nursing homes, you can make a wiser decision. <br />Home Care<br />Home care is a more private option that allows your loved one to remain in their own home. This is often less disruptive for individuals with Alzheimer's or dementia, making it the first choice for many families. Before deciding in favor of home care, there are several things you'll want to think about. <br />Pros:<br />•	Home care allows for a more personal, one-on-one relationship with the caregiver.<br />•	It's comfortable and familiar.<br />•	Seniors are able to remain as independent as they are able, rather than needing to turn over basic tasks to nursing home professionals.<br />•	In-home care is often less expensive than care out of the home.<br />Cons:<br />•	Who you hire for in-home care matters! Hiring a skilled nurse or other medical professional may be necessary if more than basic assistance is required. Caring Senior Service provides quality caregivers that you can trust, making this decision a little easier. <br />•	Homes may not be as secure as medical care facilities, which have security and staff available 24/7.<br />Nursing Home<br />Eventually, the time comes in many seniors' lives when they simply aren't able to care for themselves any longer. When that day comes, it's time to start thinking about a nursing home. <br />Pros:<br />•	Nursing homes are typically staffed with a variety of medical professionals. These professionals can care for your loved one around the clock. They can perform medical and non-medical functions. <br />•	Nursing homes can be secure, for seniors with Alzheimer's or dementia who might be prone to wandering. <br />Cons:<br />•	Nursing homes remove an individual's independence and may make your loved one &quot;feel&quot; old. However, if your loved one can no longer be trusted or remain safe with their own independence, a nursing home may be the right choice. <br />•	Nursing homes require a transition period before feeling like &quot;home,&quot; which can be difficult for some seniors. They can be noisy and feel unfamiliar for a time. <br />•	Nursing home care is often very expensive, especially for high-quality institutions. <br />The decision between a nursing home and home care is up to each individual and their family. It can often be a very personal decision or a logistical one. If you do decide that home care is the best option for your loved ones, check out our 7 questions to ask when considering home care to help you find the best fit.<br /><br />Q1. Have you ever though that when you are old and need care from others, and your family is unable to provide care , can you ask someone to take care of you at home or  go to a nursing home?  Why?<br />Q2. When your pension is not enough to pay someone to take care of you at home or go to a nursing home, how would you do to spend the rest of your life?<br />Q3.If your parents are old and need someone to take care and your siblings have their own reasons for not being able to provide care, how will you deal with this problem?   <br />Q4. Taiwan has entered the elderly society. Do you think the government has provided adequate care for the elderly and is there any room for improvement?<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Session 2<br /><br />KTV fire in Taipei City<br /><br />Fifty four people were sent to hospital, and 5 have been declared dead after a fire at a popular KTV in Taipei City today, April 26.<br />The Taipei City Fire Department dispatched 56 fire appliances, 23 ambulances, and 192 personnel to the Party World KTV on Linsen North Road in Zhongshan District after the fire was reported shortly before 11:00 am.<br />According to the preliminary investigation, the fire broke out on the 5th floor of the 14-storey building, trapping people on the higher floors.<br />A total of around 200 people were evacuated from the building, with 54 people sent to hospital. Seven of the injured were without signs of life (OHCA). Five people have been declared dead, and two are in a critical condition.<br />According to reports, the fire started on the fifth floor where a construction project was underway, and flammable building materials accelerated the blaze. An empty elevator shaft then resulted in a “chimney effect” spreading smoke to the higher floors.<br />The fire alarm and sprinkler system was turned off at the time of the fire, and firefighters suspect that the operators of the KTV or the construction personnel had turned off the system.<br />Wang zheng-xiong ( 王正雄 ) of the Taipei City Fire Department said that the fire equipment including smoke exhaust system, sprinkler system, alarms and internal broadcasting system had all been shut down. It is absolutely illegal and constitutes a “serious case of human negligence.”<br />A man rescued from the 7th floor told reporters that he was one of a group of 15 students who were alerted by other customers that the building was on fire. As the area began to fill up with smoke, they to open a fire escape sling, but the case was locked. The group then sought shelter in a bathroom, soaking clothes and surgical masks with water to filter the smoke while awaiting rescue.<br />If a Fire Starts:<br /> <br />•	Know how to safely operate a fire extinguisher<br />•	Remember to GET OUT, STAY OUT and CALL 9-1-1 or your local emergency phone number.<br />•	Yell &quot;Fire!&quot; several times and go outside right away. If you live in a building with elevators, use the stairs. Leave all your things where they are and save yourself.<br />•	If closed doors or handles are warm or smoke blocks your primary escape route, use your second way out. Never open doors that are warm to the touch.<br />•	If you must escape through smoke, get low and go under the smoke to your exit. Close doors behind you.<br />•	If smoke, heat or flames block your exit routes, stay in the room with doors closed. Place a wet towel under the door and call the fire or 119.<br />•	open a department window and wave a brightly colored cloth or flashlight to signal for help.<br />•	Once you are outside, go to your meeting place and then send one person to call the fire department. If you cannot get to your meeting place, follow your family emergency communication plan.<br /><br /><br />Q1. In this fire accident, do you think it was caused by the negligence of the fire department or cashbox or the construction unit? Why?<br />Q2. If you were a KTV consumer that day, how would you respond and escape?<br />Q3. Do you think we need to imagine and practice how to handle and escape in case of five in the place where we live? Does this drill help the actual fire?<br />Q4. Serious man-made disasters occur in Taiwan every few years, and relevant units must review and improve, but why they still happen again and again, do you know why?<br /><br />========================================================<br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00 pm-7:30 pm Free talk<br />7:30 pm-8:00 pm Session 1 discussion<br />8:00 pm-8:20 pm Presentation (At least two members of each table are invited)<br />8:20 pm-8:25 pm Break time &amp; Group picture<br />8:25 pm-8:50 pm Session 2 discussion<br />8:50 pm-9:00 pm Presentation<br /><br /><br />P.S.<br />1.因聚會地點是在咖啡店內，所以有低消80元喔!<br />2.參加三次後，只要繳交500元，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />3.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會!</div>
