02/23(Sat.)”BLOOD TYPE PERSONALITY: WHAT DOES YOUR BLOOD TYPE SAY ABOUT YOU?”&amp;” ROC”(host:Ryan)<br /><br />Article I: BLOOD TYPE PERSONALITY: WHAT DOES YOUR BLOOD TYPE SAY ABOUT YOU?<br /><br />ASIA/OCEANIA · SEPTEMBER 24, 2018<br /><br />Strike up a conversation in a bar or head out to a dinner party in Japan and the likelihood is that the conversation will, at some point, steer towards blood type (ketsuekigata 血液型).<br />Foreigners are sometimes perplexed about this Japanese fascination with blood type, which is often used as small talk when meeting someone for the first time or getting to know them.<br />So why are you constantly asked for what outsiders may deem personal medical information?<br />It is a widely held belief in Japan that your blood type determines your personality. This is a relatively modern concept as blood types themselves were only discovered in 1901.<br />, what does your blood type say about you?<br />Let's look at the characteristics stereotypically attributed to each blood group.<br />Note that many tendencies are thrown around for each blood type, however, the following are major generalizations that seem to come up time and time again. Also note that blood typing, at least under the current theory, is not concerned with + or -, simply the major letter group.<br />A Blood Type Personality<br /><br />Type A's are considered to be highly organized, particular, precise, pay attention to detail, perfectionists. They like things to be done a certain way, which can be perceived as annoying by others.<br />They also tend to be fairly quiet and shy, like to listen and follow along with conversations rather than leading them. Type A's are sensitive and take things to heart.<br /><br />B Blood Type Personality<br /><br />Type B's are easy-going, relaxed and bubbly. They are very honest and say what they think, which, depending on the circumstances, can be perceived as a good characteristic or as selfish.<br />They can concentrate but only on things that interest them, and have a tendency to go on about things that are of little or no interest to those around them.<br /><br />Type B's might be accused of being “KY“, an abbreviation of “Kuuki ga Yomenai (空気が読めない)” which literally means that you “can't read the air” i.e. you are not picking up on social signals.<br /><br />O Blood Type Personality<br />Type O's are your anything goes, personable, get-along-with-everybody types. Because of this, they are often viewed as good mediators or problem solvers.<br />They don't like to do tedious or highly detailed work. Type O's are big picture, visionary and self-confident. Although their over self-confidence at times may be viewed as arrogant. Interestingly, most Japanese Prime Ministers have been type O's.<br /><br />AB Blood Type Personality<br />The rarest blood type, AB's are often considered to have dual personalities: the precise and particular qualities of the A group along with the free-spiritedness of the B's.<br />They tend to be creative and inquisitive and, interestingly, most geniuses are said to come from the AB group.<br />Blood Type Personality Compatibility<br />So what about compatibility between the blood types?<br />A is most compatible with A and AB.<br />B is most compatible with B and AB.<br />O is most compatible with O and AB.<br />AB is most compatible with AB, B, A, and O.<br />QA<br />1.Do you believe blood type?<br />2.What kind of blood type you have?<br />3.Do you think what article saying is accurate?<br />Article II: ROC<br />The History of the Republic of China begins after the Qing dynasty in 1912, when the formation of the Republic of China as a constitutional republic put an end to 4,000 years of Imperial rule. The Qing dynasty, (also known as the Manchu dynasty), ruled from 1644–1912. The Republic had experienced many trials and tribulations after its founding which included being dominated by elements as disparate as warlord generals and foreign powers.<br /><br />In 1928, the Republic was nominally unified under the Kuomintang (KMT)—Chinese Nationalist Party—after the Northern Expedition, and was in the early stages of industrialization and modernization when it was caught in the conflicts among the Kuomintang government, the Communist Party of China, (founded 1921), which was converted into a nationalist party; local warlords, and the Empire of Japan. Most nation-building efforts were stopped during the full-scale Second Sino-Japanese War / War of Resistance against Japan from 1937 to 1945, and later the widening gap between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party made a coalition government impossible, causing the resumption of the Chinese Civil War, in 1946, shortly after the Japanese surrender to the Americans and the Western Allies in September 1945.<br /><br />A series of political, economic and military missteps led to the KMT's defeat and its retreat to Taiwan (formerly &quot;Formosa&quot;) in 1949, where it established an authoritarian one-party state continuing under Generalissimo/President Chiang Kai-shek. This state considered itself to be the continuing sole legitimate ruler of all of China, referring to the communist government or &quot;regime&quot; as illegitimate, a so-called &quot;People's Republic of China&quot; declared in Beijing (Peking) by Mao Zedong in 1949, as &quot;mainland China&quot;, &quot;Communist China, or &quot;Red China&quot;. Although supported for many years, even decades by many nations especially with the support of the United States who established a 1954 Mutual Defense treaty, as the decades passed, since political liberalization began in the late 1960s, the PRC was able after a constant yearly campaign in the United Nations to finally get approval in 1971, to take the seat for &quot;China&quot; in the General Assembly, and more importantly, be seated as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council. After recovering from this shock of rejection by its former allies and liberalization in the late 1970s from the Nationalist authoritarian government and following the death of Chiang Kai-shek, the Republic of China has transformed itself into a multiparty, representative democracy on Taiwan and given more representation to those native Taiwanese, whose ancestors predate the 1949 mainland evacuation.<br /><br />1.Do you love Republic of China?<br />2.Do you proud of your country?<br />3.Do you think ROC is a real China?<br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:25pm discussion session <br />8:25 ~ 8:30pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:30 ~9:30pm discussion session<br />(Session III)<br />9:30pm Free talk<br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12531">Danny Lin</a> — Thu Feb 21, 2019 12:53 am</p><hr />
