			<div class="content">Article 1: Taiwan EPA sets timeline for ban on plastic straws<br /><br />Taiwan EPA will start to ban the use of plastic straws by food and beverage businesses starting in 2019.<br />By Keoni Everington, Taiwan News, Staff Writer 2018/02/14 10:44<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3363954">https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3363954</a><!-- m --><br /><br />TAIPEI (Taiwan News) -- Taiwan's government is planning on banning the use of single-use plastic drinking straws in different stages, the first of which will be with the food and beverage industry next year, said Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) Minister Lee Ying-yuan (李應元) at a press conference yesterday (Feb. 13), reported Apple Daily. <br /><br />Starting in 2019, large food and beverage vendors such as convenience stores, plastic straws and plastic bags will be banned from use inside. Beginning in 2020, all stores that issue uniform invoices will be banned from offering free plastic shopping bags, disposable food containers and disposable utensils. <br /><br />It is estimated that by 2030, a complete ban will be put in place on all plastic bags, disposable utensils, plastic shopping bags, and disposable beverage cups.<br /><br />In an effort to try to deal with the massive marine waste crisis, the EPA has worked with a number of environmental groups to set up the &quot;Sea Waste Management Platform&quot; and yesterday announced a plan of action, which includes a four sources of plastics to be phased out in three stages: 2020, 2025 and 2030. <br /><br />Plastic straws are the first item to be targeted for restrictions and bans by the EPA. Starting in 2019, food and beverage stores will be restricted from providing plastic straws for in-store use. In 2020, free plastic straws will be banned from all food and beverage establishments. <br /><br />Starting in 2025, even plastic straws for carryout will be banned and customers will need to pay a fee to use them. In 2030, the goal is to have a complete blanket ban on the use of plastic straws at all establishments in Taiwan.<br /><br />As for plastic shopping bag phase, the EPA will implement a ban on all stores that issue uniform invoices in 2020. In 2025, prices on plastic shopping bags will be raised, and by 2030 such bags are to be completely banned. <br /><br />Starting in 2020, food and beverage businesses will not be allowed to provide customers inside their establishments with disposable utensils. In 2025, a price system will be implemented on disposable tableware, and by 2030 a complete ban will be imposed on disposable utensils. <br /><br />In 2020, plastic beverage cups will be restricted and by 2025 users will have to pay an extra fee to use them. By 2030 take-away beverage cups will be completely banned. <br /><br />Lee said that the future prices for such disposable plastic items in stores will not necessarily be based on the price of such items in Europe. Instead, it will be based on domestic prices in Taiwan, but Lee emphasized that the reduction of the use of plastics is not just the job of the EPA, but it is everyone's responsibility to create a better environment for future generations. <br /><br />Discussion:<br /><br />1.	How will banning plastic straws, disposable food containers and utensils impact the consumers, food and beverage vendors, and the manufacturers of these plastics items?<br /><br />2.	Do you know any alternatives to plastic straws?  Are they expensive?  What alternatives will you use instead of plastic straws? <br /><br />3.	What can you do to reduce your own single-use plastics?  What else can we do to reduce the ocean plastic pollution?<br /><br />4.	Could you share anything about global plastic waste crisis?<br /><br /><br /><br />Article 2: 8 Ways to Change Your Habits (And Actually Get What You Want) <br /><br />August 10, 2017/by Sarah Peck<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://learn.onemonth.com/8-ways-to-change-your-habits-and-actually-get-what-you-want/">https://learn.onemonth.com/8-ways-to-ch ... -you-want/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />What does it take to make a goal or a dream come true?<br /><br />You know the drill. You’re vowing to change your behavior. Tomorrow I’ll … start meditating. Start brushing my teeth. Finally get around to writing those essays you’ve been meaning to write. Make plans for the new book you’re putting together. Learn to code.<br /><br />You vow that you’re going to do it. You know it. You have to do it.<br /><br />But it didn’t get done today. So you wake up tomorrow and do the same thing you’ve always done. Yet your behavior doesn’t change.<br /><br />When we make broad-sweeping declarations about our life, they don’t work.<br /><br />In fact vowing to do anything, no matter how strong the vow, usually wears off as your willpower drains throughout the day. So how do you make a change in your life that’s actually effective? “Everyday people plan to do difficult things, but they don’t do them. They think, ‘I’ll do it tomorrow,’ and they swear to themselves that they’ll follow through the next day,” write Carol Dweck, researcher at Stanford and author of Mindset. “Research by Peter Gollwitzer and his colleagues show that vowing, even intense vowing, is often useless. The next day comes and the next day goes.”<br /><br />So how do you make a resolution that actually works? Here are a few of the best tips and tools we’ve read about, used, and know to work:<br /><br />1. Make a concrete, vivid plan.<br /><br />What works, writes Dweck, is making a vivid, concrete plan. Describe to yourself exactly what you’re going to do, how you’re going to do it, and what steps you need to take, down to the minute detail. “Think of something you need to do, something you want to learn, or a problem you have to confront. What is it? Now make a concrete plan. When will you follow through on your plan? Where will you do it? How will you do it? Think about it in vivid detail.”<br /><br />Increase your possibility of success by outlining when you’re going to do something, by putting it in your mind as a behavior — and on your calendar as an action.<br /><br />These concrete plans — plans you can visualize — about when, where, and how you are going to do something lead to really high levels of follow-through, which, of course, ups the chances of success.<br /><br />If you’re looking to write a book in the new year (which, full disclosure, I am), then break it down into its constituent parts. When will you write? What will it look like? What days a week will this happen?<br /><br />Think about it exactly, not vaguely.<br /><br />For me: I’m going to set an interim goal of writing on my book for at least ten days in January. More specifically, a writing session includes just opening the doc and working on a single page. I’m focused on making the habit of working on my book part of my regular routine.<br /><br />2. To make change, visualize the change. Take time to imagine your behavior change in detail.<br /><br />It turns out, detailed visualization is powerful enough to change behaviors even before you start. As I’ve written about before, the power of visualization is so important, it’s proven to change behaviors:<br /><br />“In a famous basketball study, players were divided into groups that visualized perfect free throws, a second group that practiced their shots, and a placebo group that did nothing. At the end of the study, the players that visualized their perfect throws improved almost as much as the group that practiced — without ever touching a basketball. It’s important to note that the visualization involved the specific steps and actions it takes to perfect a free-throw shot.”<br /><br />If you want to change what you do, you can begin with your thoughts.<br /><br />3. Start small.<br /><br />Habit change happens when you start really small. Want to learn how to run? Your first month might focus just on the first five minutes of each run, until you’ve mastered that first step. This includes mastering the steps of putting your shoes on, walking outside, and only then maybe adding a few minutes to walk to the corner or around the block each day.<br /><br />What’s key is successive positive reinforcement, or rewarding the behavior you want more of. Too often we jump cold turkey into a brand-new routine only to find ourselves back in our old habits before we know it. Instead, focus on the smallest possible change that could build into a habit over time. For more on this, check out Stanford Professor B.J. Foggs’ Tiny Habits program.<br /><br />“We often think that if you start with something so small, it won’t make a difference. But the truth is, because that momentum builds after you get going, you can often start with something really tiny, and it will blossom into something much bigger,” says writer and author James Clear.<br /><br />If you’re stuck or overwhelmed with a new project, ask yourself: what’s the smallest thing I could do next to make this happen? It doesn’t matter how small it is — the trick is to make it small enough that you actually do something.<br /><br />4. Prime yourself.<br /><br />New behaviors need an introduction, of sorts. Whenever I start to learn something new, I try to expose myself to the new context before actually committing to a new behavior change. Often the weight of how much is going on can be intimidating — researching a new location, mapping it out on google maps, looking up schedules, figuring out payment options, sticking to the plan — that enough friction in any of these steps and you don’t end up doing it.<br /><br />Instead, make one of the first steps a walk through. Whenever I try out a new gym or studio, I go in for a tour. You can learn the routine, see the studio, and practice the behavior of going to the gym. This makes it easier for you to repeat this action down the line because you already know how to do it.<br /><br />Want to start flossing your teeth in the morning? Go right now to your bathroom sink and practice the behavior. Get out the floss, put it on the countertop, and floss at least one tooth. Even if it’s 2pm in the afternoon, even if it’s just one tooth. This will prime you for repeating the behavior the next day.<br /><br />5. Look to the process, not the outcome.<br /><br />Too often we confuse the reward of the outcome with understanding what, exactly, it’s going to take to get there. Sitting down to write every single day is a lot more boring than having a published book in your hand. So how do you create a schedule that rewards the small successes?<br /><br />It’s actually psychologically difficult to conceptualize change. We don’t understand thresholds of small changes; instead, we’re biased to see big wins. The biggest change happens over time, however, when you enact small, consistent behaviors. Sometimes mundane acts over time add up to something more exciting, after all.<br /><br />“It’s so easy to focus on this idea of one defining moment, or overnight success, or some massive transformation to flip a switch and become a new person — but it’s not that way at all,” explains Clear. To make a behavior stick, look closely at the process and whether or not you’re really willing to commit to the, at times, drudgery and slog that it’ll take to get there.<br /><br />And be ready to surprise yourself. Entrepreneur Corbett Barr reminds us that “Not a lot will change in one single day, but a lot can change in 30 days.” It’s rare that I’ll have a breakthrough day to finish my book (and by definition, that will only be one day out of many), but if I keep showing up, that day will arrive.<br /><br />6. Motivation doesn’t last long, so plan ahead for when you’re not motivated.<br /><br />How do you stay motivated? Well, it’s not about motivation — it’s about habit. Stephen Pressfield describes Somerset Maugham’s relationship to motivation and writing:<br /><br />“Someone once asked Somerset Maugham if he wrote on a schedule or only when struck by inspiration. “I write only when inspiration strikes,” he replied. “Fortunately it strikes every morning at nine o’clock sharp.” Maugham reckoned another deeper truth: that by performing the mundane act of sitting down and starting to work, he set in motion a mysterious but infallible sequence of events that would produce inspiration, as surely as if the goddess had synchronized her watch with his.” — Steven Pressfield from The War of Art<br /><br />In other words, the difference between a professional and an amateur is that a professional doesn’t wait for motivation. They get to it, even if they don’t feel like it.<br /><br />7. When you get stuck, reduce the scope, but stick to the schedule.<br /><br />This idea comes from 37 Signals, and I heard about it from Eric Zimmer and James Clear on “The One You Feed,” podcast. James writes every Monday and Thursday, and he explains that even when there’s a dud of a day, he still shows up and sticks to the schedule.<br /><br />It doesn’t matter how you feel, it’s about shipping something. Rather than skipping altogether when circumstances get dicey (skipping your workout because you only have 20 minutes, avoiding your writing session because you’re tired), instead, find a way to do something, even if it’s just for a moment. Do jumping jacks for 6 minutes, then 1 minute of pushups. Write 200 words, or three sentences.<br /><br />Whatever time you have is how much you do.<br /><br />A little of something is a lot more than nothing.<br /><br />8. Behavior change requires… change.<br /><br />In order to get a different outcome, change the inputs.<br /><br />This might seem exceptionally obvious, but it’s worth pointing out: if you want a different result, you’ll have to do something differently than you’re currently doing. What you’re doing right now (and for me, it’s spending three weeks not writing, then a day stressing about writing) — isn’t getting you the result that you want.<br /><br />If you aren’t getting what you want, then what you’re doing isn’t working. In order to get what you want, something about the process will have to change.<br /><br />What are you willing to do differently to get what you want?<br /><br />How can you change your habits to get more of what you want?<br /><br />Discussion:<br /><br />1.	The author provides 8 tips to change our habits.  Do you think if they are helpful?  Pls choose three tips which you think will work for you; and share your comments about them.<br /><br />2.	Pls share your experiences about changing or developing habits.<br /><br />3.	Are you thinking to build a new habit now?  What’s it?  What’s your strategy to make it come true?</div>
