<span style="color: #FF0000">Thursday gathering of Royal Club is relocated to Ikari 怡客咖啡, 台北市衡陽路116號</span><br /><br />Session 1<br /><br />What is Minimalism?<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.theminimalists.com/minimalism/">https://www.theminimalists.com/minimalism/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />So what is this minimalism thing? It’s quite simple: to be a minimalist you must live with less than 100 things, you can’t own a car or a home or a television, you can’t have a career, you must live in exotic hard-to-pronounce places all over the world, you must start a blog, you can’t have children, and you must be a young white male from a privileged background.<br />OK, we’re joking—obviously. But people who dismiss minimalism as some sort of fad usually mention any of the above “restrictions” as to why they could “never be a minimalist.” Minimalism isn’t about any of those things, but it can help you accomplish them. If you desire to live with fewer material possessions, or not own a car or a television, or travel all over the world, then minimalism can lend a hand. But that’s not the point.<br />Minimalism is a tool that can assist you in finding freedom. Freedom from fear. Freedom from worry. Freedom from overwhelm. Freedom from guilt. Freedom from depression. Freedom from the trappings of the consumer culture we’ve built our lives around. Real freedom.<br />That doesn’t mean there’s anything inherently wrong with owning material possessions. Today’s problem seems to be the meaning we assign to our stuff: we tend to give too much meaning to our things, often forsaking our health, our relationships, our passions, our personal growth, and our desire to contribute beyond ourselves. Want to own a car or a house? Great, have at it! Want to raise a family and have a career? If these things are important to you, then that’s wonderful. Minimalism simply allows you to make these decisions more consciously, more deliberately.<br />There are plenty of successful minimalists who lead appreciably different lives. Our friend Leo Babauta has a wife and six children. Joshua Becker has a career he enjoys, a family he loves, and a house and a car in suburbia. Conversely, Colin Wright owns 51 things and travels all over the world, and Tammy Strobel and her husband live in a “tiny house” and are completely car-free. Even though each of these people are different, they all share two things in common: they are minimalists, and minimalism has allowed them to pursue purpose-driven lives.<br />But how can these people be so different and yet still be minimalists? That brings us back to our original question: What is minimalism? If we had to sum it up in a single sentence, we would say, Minimalism is a tool to rid yourself of life’s excess in favor of focusing on what’s important—so you can find happiness, fulfillment, and freedom.<br />Minimalism has helped us…<br />Eliminate our discontent<br />Reclaim our time<br />Live in the moment<br />Pursue our passions<br />Discover our missions<br />Experience real freedom<br />Create more, consume less<br />Focus on our health<br />Grow as individuals<br />Contribute beyond ourselves<br />Rid ourselves of excess stuff<br />Discover purpose in our lives<br />By incorporating minimalism into our lives, we’ve finally been able to find lasting happiness—and that’s what we’re all looking for, isn’t it? We all want to be happy. Minimalists search for happiness not through things, but through life itself; thus, it’s up to you to determine what is necessary and what is superfluous in your life.<br />Through our essays we intend to present to you ideas of how to achieve a minimalist lifestyle without adhering to a strict code or an arbitrary set of rules. A word of warning, though: it isn’t easy to take the first steps, but your journey towards minimalism gets much easier—and more rewarding—the further you go. The first steps often take radical changes in your mindset, actions, and habits. Fret not, though—we want to help: we’ve documented our experiences so you can learn from our failures and successes, applying what we’ve learned to your own situation, assisting you in leading a more meaningful life.<br /><br />Reference:<br />The Home of Minimalism from Finland<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A7kjGzICA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A7kjGzICA</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Questions:<br />1.''Less is more'', Do you agree the concept of Minimalism, Why or Why not?<br />2. What are your shopping habits? e.g. online shopping or in store shopping; advertised brands or not advertised brands etc. Have you ever buy things that you don't really need it but just want it?<br />3. What is the first thing or habit that comes to your mind that you should get rid of it? <br />4. The NT$3,000 revitalization vouchers that Taiwan government released that seems to against the concept of Minimalism. What do you think? Would it hurt our economy if people stop buying things beyond what they really need?<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Session 2<br /><br />10 Practical Ways to Improve Time Management Skills<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/10-ways-improve-your-time-management-skills.html">https://www.lifehack.org/articles/produ ... kills.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Do you often feel stressed out with too much work or too many responsibilities? As time passes, do you feel like you have more tasks on hand than you have time to do them?<br /><br />The trick is to organize your tasks and use your time effectively to get more things done each day. This can help you to lower stress levels and improve your productivity both at work and at home.<br /><br />Time management skills take time to develop and will look different for each person. Finding what works best for you and your busy schedule is key here.<br /><br />To get you started, here are 10 ways to improve your time management skills and increase productivity.<br /><br />1. Delegate Tasks<br />It is common for all of us to take on more tasks than we are capable of completing. This can often result in stress and burnout.<br /><br />Delegation does not mean you are running away from your responsibilities but are instead learning proper management of your tasks. Learn the art of delegating work to your subordinates as per their skills and abilities and get more done. This will not only free up time for you but will help your team members feel like an integral piece of the work puzzle.<br /><br />2. Prioritize Work<br />Before the start of the day, make a list of tasks that need your immediate attention. Unimportant tasks can consume much of your precious time, and we tend to offer these too much of our energy because they are easier or less stressful.<br /><br />However, identifying urgent tasks that need to be completed on that day is critical to your productivity. Once you know where to put your energy, you will start to get things done in an order that works for you and your schedule.<br /><br />In short, prioritize your important tasks to keep yourself focused.<br /><br />3. Create a Schedule<br />Carry a planner or notebook with you and list all the tasks that come to your mind. Being able to check off items as you complete them will give you a sense of accomplishment and keep you motivated.<br /><br />Make a simple ‘To Do’ list before the start of the day, prioritize the tasks, and focus on the essentials. Make sure that these tasks are attainable, too. If there is a big task you need to complete, make that the only thing on your list. You can push the others to the next day. <br /><br />To better manage your time management skills, you may think of making 3 lists: work, home and personal.<br /><br />4. Set up Deadlines<br />When you have a task at hand, set a realistic deadline and stick to it. Once you set a deadline, it may be helpful to write it on a sticky note and put it near your workspace. This will give you a visual cue to keep you on task.<br /><br />Try to set a deadline a few days before the task is due so that you can complete all those tasks that may get in the way. Challenge yourself and meet the deadline; reward yourself for meeting a difficult challenge.<br /><br />5. Overcome Procrastination<br />Procrastination is one of the things that has a negative effect on productivity. It can result in wasting essential time and energy. It could be a major problem in both your career and your personal life[1].<br /><br />Avoiding procrastination can be difficult for many. We tend to procrastinate when we feel bored or overwhelmed. Try to schedule in smaller, fun activities throughout the day to break up the more difficult tasks. This may help you stay on track.<br /><br />6. Deal With Stress Wisely<br />Stress often occurs when we accept more work than we are capable of accomplishing. The result is that our body starts feeling tired, which can affect our productivity.<br /><br />Stress comes in various forms for different people, but some productive ways to deal with stress can include:<br /><br />Getting outside<br />Exercising<br />Practicing meditation<br />Calling up a friend<br />Participating in your favorite hobby<br />Listening to music or a podcast<br />The key is to find what works for you when it comes to lowering your stress response. If you don’t have time for anything else, try a couple of breathing techniques. These can be done in minutes and have been proven to lower stress-inducing hormones.<br /><br />7. Avoid Multitasking<br />Most of us feel that multitasking is an efficient way of getting things done, but the truth is that we do better when we focus and concentrate on one thing. Multitasking hampers productivity and should be avoided to improve time management skills.<br /><br />Make use of to-do lists and deadlines to help you stay focused! This way you can do better at what you’re doing. Wait until you finish one before starting another. You’ll be surprised by how much more you’re able to get done.<br /><br />8. Start Early<br />Most successful people have one thing in common — they start their day early as it gives them time to sit, think, and plan their day.<br /><br />When you get up early, you are more calm, creative, and clear-headed. As the day progresses, your energy levels start going down, which affects your productivity, motivation, and focus[2].<br /><br />If you’re not a morning person, you can just try waking up thirty minutes earlier than your normal time. You’ll be amazed by how much you can get done in that bit of time. If you don’t want to use it to work, use it to do a bit of exercise or eat a healthy breakfast. This kind of routine will also contribute to your productivity during the day.<br /><br />9. Take Regular Breaks<br />Whenever you find yourself feeling tired and stressed, take a break for 10 to 15 minutes. Too much stress can take a toll on your body and affect your productivity.<br /><br />And even better, schedule your break times. It helps you to relax and gets back to work with energy again later. If you know a break is coming, you’ll likely be able to overcome boredom or a lack of motivation to push through the task at hand.<br /><br />Take a walk, listen to some music, or do some quick stretches. The best idea is to take a break from work completely and spend time with your friends and family.<br /><br />10. Learn to Say No<br />Politely refuse to accept additional tasks if you think that you’re already overloaded with work. Take a look at your to do list before agreeing to take on extra work.<br /><br />Many people worry that saying no will make them look selfish, but the truth is that saying no is one of the best ways to take care of yourself and your time. When you take care of this, you’ll find you have more energy to devote to the important things, which the people around you will ultimately appreciate.<br /><br />Final Thoughts<br />When you get clear about what’s on your plate, you’ll be more focused and get more done in less time.<br /><br />Good time management requires a daily practice of prioritizing tasks and organizing them in a way that can save time while achieving more. Use the above strategies for few weeks and see if they help you. You may be surprised just how much more time you seem to have.<br /><br />Questions:<br />1.Are you usually working overtime or be able to get off work on time? Have you seen any workaholics in your family or friends or colleagues? What do you think of them?<br />2.Do you schedule your daily life or just go with the flows? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each side?<br />3.Have you ever tried any methods to manage your time properly? Does it work?<br />4.Any ways this article mentioned that you would like to practice?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25437">Michael</a> — Mon Aug 03, 2020 9:04 am</p><hr />
