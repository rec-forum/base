Whether they’re the leaders or the followers, fanatics are people who indulge in a heady, intoxicating and toxic concoction of self-affirming, know-it-all confidence that they have unique access to absolute truths, truths so perfect that they have to impose them on everyone.<br /><br />The absolute truths that fanatics latch onto might be religious or political, right wing or left wing, Christian or Islamic, libertarian or communist, new age spiritual or old-time religious. It’s not what they believe that makes them fanatics but how they believe it, that they have final word, no need to consider further evidence, no need to ever wonder or doubt themselves again.<br /><br />Fanaticism is a drug. Let loose on society it's like crack cocaine or alcohol only worse. Fanatics drive through life like alcoholics driving under the influence. They think they’re perfectly fine driving. They kill innocent bystanders, sometimes by the thousands or millions.<br /><br />We’ve learned though, that treating alcoholics as criminals doesn’t help us or them. Alcoholics Anonymous has been so successful in part because it gives the addict a graceful way out of the corner he or she is painted into. It’s hard to kick a drug if sobriety means admitting that you’re a vile person through and through. Shaming the addict can make him dig in his heals. It’s easier to kick it if you declare that you’ve become host to a virulent disease that can attack any of us. No one is exempt from the risk. It’s not your fault, but it is your responsibility to kick it.<br /><br />What's needed is an AA-style safe-haven for recovering political and religious fanatics, ideologues and absolutists. It’s message is, &quot;Yes, you’re a wreck and have done real damage. But don't beat yourself up over it. Like so many of us, you became host to a powerful parasite that mutates quickly and has taken over minds throughout human history. Don't blame yourself. You are not alone. Join us. Together we can lick this thing.&quot;<br /><br />Here’s a rough draft for the 12 Steps of Fanatics Anonymous<br /><br />1. We admitted we were powerless over fanaticism—that our lives had become unmanageable.<br /><br />2. Came to believe that Reason, a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.<br /><br />3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of Reason.<br /><br />4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.<br /><br />5. Admitted to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.<br /><br />6. Were entirely ready to have Reason remove all these defects of character.<br /><br />7. Humbly invoked reason to remove our shortcomings.<br /><br />8. Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.<br /><br />9. Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.<br /><br />10. Continued to take personal inventory, and when we were wrong, promptly admitted it.<br /><br />11. Sought through inquiry, debate, conversation, curiosity and doubt to improve our conscious contact with Reason seeking for better understanding of the human tension between what we want to believe and what’s most likely to be true.<br /><br />12. Having had an awakening to Reason as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to fanatics of all kinds, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.<br /><br />Of course, the peculiar move here is replacing god with Reason, and more peculiar perhaps to repurpose the AA model for fanatics anonymous, what with AA’s surrender to god’s will, the most notorious excuse for fanaticism in fanaticism’s long and sordid history.<br /><br />And what is Reason anyway?<br /><br />Reason is nature’s gift to humankind and to the humanitarian impulse. It’s also called rationality, which comes from the same root as ratio, to compare, discern, evaluate, judging carefully and humbly in our efforts to find the better bets on how to live.<br /><br />Reason is also related to logos, a word with diverse implications over the millennia but related to language, and logic, uniquely human gifts for our ongoing effort to understand the true ways of the world.<br /><br />Ongoing--that’s how science practices reason. Where fanatics say “I reasoned once, came to the absolute truth and don’t have to reason again,” science, a practical practice we can learn to apply well beyond the lab, admits that there’s no last word, just today’s best guesses, to be improved upon through ongoing inquiry.<br /><br />Sustained reason is just the hard work that an addiction to fanaticism frees us from. No wonder fanaticism is so intoxicating. Being a know-it-all provides such powerful pain relief. Reason is a much harder master than god. Humbling ourselves to it is painful.<br /><br />No wonder so many of us fall off the wagon.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion</span><br />Q1 What is fanaticism? What do you think of fanaticism?<br />Q2 What cures religious fanaticism?<br />Q3 Is fanaticism same as addiction?<br />Q4 Are you a fanaticism? Can you share examples<br />(from you or people you know)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Article 2 - Leaders vs. Followers</span><br /><a href="http://www.livescience.com/17116-life-extremes-leaders-followers.html" class="postlink">http://www.livescience.com/17116-life-extremes-leaders-followers.html</a><br /><br />In this weekly series, LiveScience examines the psychology and sociology of opposite human behavior and personality types.<br />&quot;Who wants to lead the class project?&quot; the teacher asks. Some hands go up, others stay down, someone looks at the ground and another kid yells &quot;I do! I do!&quot;<br />Even at a young age, a few of us jump to the fore, excited to take on the responsibility of leadership. Others of us defer such roles, content to follow who's in charge.<br /><br />The fact that these tendencies emerge in youth speaks to how science has shown, to a certain extent, that there are natural born leaders and followers. Genetically conferred traits such as outgoingness, intelligence, a will to dominance and physical attractiveness do correlate with those who assume leadership positions.<br /><br />Followers can possess all of these traits too. But given the evolutionary pressures that have favored group coordination going back millions of years, the emergence of leaders is guaranteed whenever a pack of people get together.<br /><br />&quot;Leadership is hardwired into our DNA and it comes from dominance and social hierarchy in animals,&quot; said Ron Riggio, professor of leadership and organizational psychology at Claremont McKenna College in California.<br /><br />Humankind, however, has largely transcended the natural pecking order in which the physically biggest and toughest tend to lord over smaller subordinates. Otherwise, all our leaders would be National Football League linemen, yet leaders and followers come in all shapes and sizes.<br /><br />Studies suggest that ultimately our upbringing and experiences matter most in developing innate tendencies, researchers say. In other words, leaders and followers can be made, out to the extremes of dictators and those who blindly follow them.<br /><br />Born to be the boss?<br /><br />One might assume that a will to power runs in families. Consider, for example, the political dynasties of the Adams, the Kennedys and the Bushes, or football quarterback families such as the Mannings.<br /><br />Studies support this idea that leadership can be rooted in an individual's &quot;nature.&quot; A built-in drive to lead comes in the form of genes passed on from parents.<br /><br />&quot;Genes affect your chemistry, your brain and your physiology,&quot; said psychologist Richard D. Arvey, head of the department of management and organization at the National University of Singapore. &quot;Think of [genes] as working through personality, intelligence, cognitive skills and also some physical characteristics. All of those are involved and correlated with who becomes a leader.&quot;<br /><br />To gauge the impact genes have on leadership, Arvey and colleagues compared surveys filled out by identical twins and fraternal twins. Identical twins share 100 percent of each other's genes, while fraternal twins share 50 percent. When raised by the same family, sets of twins grow up in similar environments, allowing genes' influence to be clearly assessed. [8 Fascinating Facts About Twins]<br /><br />For the study, participants indicated the number of leadership roles they had taken, from workplace supervisory and managerial jobs to the top spots in professional organizations.<br /><br />As Arvey explained, if leadership as measured in the survey had a genetic basis, identical twins would show more closely matched results than fraternal twins.<br /><br />That is in fact what the researchers saw. Surveys of both men and women in 2006 and 2007, respectively, revealed that 31 and 32 percent of the variability on leadership boiled down to innate genetics.<br /><br />Figuring the function of the genes in question will be very difficult, said Arvey. &quot;There's no particular [leadership] gene,&quot; he said. Rather, hundreds of genes complexly interact to produce biological tendencies that influence a person to want to wear the crown.<br /><br />Life makes leaders<br /><br />Compared to nature, &quot;nurture&quot; — the environment — has much more of an impact, according to Arvey's studies and others. &quot;The bang for the buck is in the environmental aspects,&quot; said Arvey.<br /><br />About two-thirds of the elements that mold someone into a leader are dependent on upbringing and personal experience, including education and the handling of challenging situations. Again going with the example of political dynasties, children in those families tended to have access to wealth, privilege and an expectation to carry on the leadership torch.<br /><br />Some people come to enjoy the results of taking charge, taking their lumps when it doesn't work out, while others grow accustomed to helping a group toward its goals.<br /><br />Follow the leader . . . sometimes<br /><br />Followership, in this sense, is not merely the absence of leadership. Many of the qualities that make a good leader also make an ideal follower, including intelligence and communication abilities, said Riggio.<br /><br />In following the evolutionary example, however, someone has to be top dog. Oftentimes the biggest and toughest male and female animals become the alphas of a wolf pack, say, or in monkey troops, cow herds, or flocks of geese. The subordinate role falls to the smaller and weaker members of the group.<br /><br />&quot;If you're going to be the alpha gorilla, it's really based on your size and temperament,&quot; Riggio said. &quot;You have to be willing to fight and able to fight.&quot;<br /><br />Our complex society has dispelled this physical might-makes-right system. &quot;We took care of that with weapons. A smaller guy can beat a bigger guy with a weapon.&quot;<br /><br />One perhaps need look no further than some of humanity's most extreme leaders, who have physically been anything but the part of the dominant silverback gorilla. Consider the homely dictator Adolf Hitler and the old, wild-eyed Heaven's Gate cult leader Marshall Applegate, who committed suicide along with his 39 followers back in 1997.<br /><br />Partially gene-derived personality traits such as loyalty and obedience can be beneficial, of course, but if taken too far can lead to blind followership. A fusion of powerful leaders with legions of unquestioning followers can and has resulted in neither role serving the other well.<br /><br />After all, a leader is only as good as the supporters who bear his or her decisions out. &quot;Your effectiveness as a leader has very much to do with your followers,&quot; said Arvey.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion</span><br />Q1 Do you tend to fall into leader or follower roles?<br />Q2 Is followership more important than leadership?<br />Q3 How can we become a good followership?<br />Q4 How can we become a good leadership?<br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:05pm discussion session (35 mins)<br />8:05 ~ 8:20pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:20 ~ 8:25pm Regrouping &amp; instruction giving<br />(Session II)<br />8:25 ~ 8:35pm Taking a 10 minutes break (Intermission)<br />8:35 ~ 9:10pm discussion session (35 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~ 9:30pm Concluding remarks<br />The meeting place of Thursday:<br />摩斯漢堡明曜店 (明曜百貨後面第二條巷子地下室)台北市大安區仁愛路四段151巷37號B1樓<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運 - 板南線 - 忠孝敦化站 (步行約5分鐘)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
