The Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP) in the UK says it is imperative for the over-65s to keep active to maintain their strength as they age. It warns that millions of people risk falling over or injuring themselves because they are failing to maintain their strength. Falls among the elderly cause the vast majority of hip injuries. The CSP says nearly a quarter of over-65s don't do any exercises to keep their muscles strong. A CSP spokesperson said: &quot;For those 65 and over, they can also include activities that involve stepping and jumping, like dancing, or chair aerobics.&quot;<br /><br />One recommendation the CSP made to the over-65s is to carry shopping home from the supermarket. It warns against Internet shopping, noting that while it is convenient, the rise of Internet shopping means fewer people are getting their &quot;shopping workout&quot;. Professor Karen Middleton, chief executive of CSP, said: &quot;Research shows getting stronger brings a whole host of health benefits so it is incredibly important that people don't overlook strengthening when being active.&quot; She also suggested gardening, vacuuming and standing up out of a chair 10 times. Professor Middleton added: &quot;We must move past the idea that becoming weaker and frailer is inevitable as we get older.&quot;<br /><br />Discussion:<br />1). To keep over-65s people strength up and live longer, what kind of the activities are more helpful? <br />2). To maintain strength as the age over-65s, do you agree they carry shopping home from the supermarket, Please share the reasons for pro &amp; con.<br />3). Do you think becoming weaker and frailer is inevitable as we get older. Is there any method to minimize it?<br />4). How strong will you be when you are at 65s?<br /><br />=============================================================================================================<br /><br />Article 2：The dark side of green transportation<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2017/10/23/2003680870">http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/ar ... 2003680870</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Electric cars are touted for their environmental benefits but a risk analysis expert warns that the demand for raw materials could lead to slavery<br />By Belinda Goldsmith  /  Thomson Reuters Foundation, London<br /><br />Electric vehicles are often labeled the “green cars” of the future but rising demand for the raw materials needed to get them on the road could increase the risk of slavery in their production, according to a risk analysis report on Tuesday.<br /><br />British risk analysis firm Verisk Maplecroft said electric vehicle makers would need to be careful as they cast a wider net to source raw materials ranging from rubber to aluminum and mica needed for the 30,000 or so components in each car.<br />But tracing the raw materials was only one problem in the complex supply chain with an elaborate network of suppliers and transporters involved, adding risks at every stage.<br />“Increased exposure to human rights abuses, environmental degradation and less-than-savory governments is therefore going to be inevitable as the industry’s growth accelerates,” Maplecroft researcher Stefan Sabo-Walsh said in the report.<br /><br />The report, based on data from the firm’s commodity risk service, said China was now the top producing country for about 86 percent of the key commodities in lithium-ion batteries but this was likely to change as production picks up speed.<br /><br />Demand for eco-friendly electric vehicles is on the rise.<br />Car buyers had shunned electric vehicles because of their high cost and limited operating range until Tesla unveiled a model in 2012 that cracked 322km on one charge.<br /><br />Since then, big advances in battery technology and a global crackdown on pollution in the wake of Volkswagen’s diesel scandal have raised pressure on carmakers to speed up development of zero-emission alternatives.<br /><br />Paris authorities this month unveiled plans to banish all petrol and diesel-fueled cars by 2030 while the British government earlier this year said it would ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2040.<br /><br />Sabo-Walsh said this meant businesses would seek new source countries with reserves of key materials such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Russia, the Philippines and South Africa.<br /><br />But in some countries it was hard to trace if their raw materials came from legal, commercial mines or from illegal smallholder mines where forced and child labour are rife.<br /><br />The risks associated with lithium-ion batteries were of particular concern. The Democratic Republic of Congo is the leading global producer of cobalt used in these batteries, but has faced global criticism for human rights abuses.<br /><br />The United Nations children’s agency (UNICEF) estimates 40,000 children work in the warn-torn central African nation’s cobalt mines in dire conditions.<br /><br />“This should provide an instant red flag for the industry operators who will increasingly face brand damage or regulatory penalties from the slew of emerging legislation addressing supply chain issues,” Sabo-Walsh said.<br /><br />As well potential slavery, other risks range from corruption associated with overland transport to east African ports to potential natural hazards disrupting smelting in Indonesia.<br />Sabo-Walsh said a big problem for the industry and electric vehicle companies is that no laws or significant initiatives exist for the majority of the raw materials they use.<br />“To maintain their clean, green image, they will need to ensure every individual component required for the manufacture of their vehicles is ethically sourced and as untarnished as a new vehicle rolling off the production line,” he said<br /><br />Discussions:<br />1). Why the expert said the demand for materials of the Electric cars could lead to slavery. Could you share your perspectives?<br />2). Do you think the zero-emmission is possible for the future transportation.<br />3). Do you own the green car, can you share what the benefits you gained from it?<br />4). “To maintain their clean, green image, they will need to ensure every individual component required for the manufacture of their vehicles is ethically sourced “ untarnished as a new vehicle rolling off the production line,” Please share your viewpoints about this.</div>
