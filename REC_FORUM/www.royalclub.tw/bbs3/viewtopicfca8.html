			<div class="content">Self Compassion (自我疼惜，善待自己)<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/34986?ref=translated">https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/34986?ref=translated</a><!-- m --><br /><br />A Self-Compassion Exercise To survive in this high-pressured, crazy world, most of us have to become highly adept at self-criticism. We learn how to tell ourselves off for our failures, and for not working hard or smart enough. But so good are we at this, that we're sometimes in danger of falling prey to an excessive version of self-criticism, what we might call self-flagellation, a rather dangerous stage which just ushers into pressure and under-performance. We might simply lose the will to get out of bed. For those moments, we need a corrective. We need to carve out time for an emotional state of which many of us are profoundly suspicious: self-compassion. We're suspicious because that sounds horribly close to self-pity. But because depression and self-hatred are serious enemies of a good life, we need to appreciate the role of self-care in a good, ambitious and fruitful life. To this end, we can perform what we've called, &quot;a self-compassion exercise,&quot; a structured meditation, lasting 15 minutes or so. Lying in bed, or perhaps a bath,turn over a sequence of thoughts that interrupt and correct the flow of your worse self-accusations. For a time, adopt an entirely kindly perspective on your setbacks. The self-compassion exercise goes like this: Step One We're so in love with success we fail to notice the scale of the challenges we routinely set ourselves. There is nothing remotely normal about what we've tried to achieve. We failed, but given the mountain we were trying to climb, the conclusion doesn't have to be that we're simply fools. Step Two We have tricky family histories. We all do. There were things which happened to us at the hands of others which can help to explain some of our current troubles. We're not entirely sane or well, but none of us are. We weren't well set up to carry out certain tasks. It isn't wholly our fault in the here and now. Step Three From the media, you'd think everyone was rich and famous and successful, but in reality, undramatic, quiet failure is, by a huge margin, the statistical norm. We shouldn't tear ourselves apart for not managing to beat what were, in truth, awesome odds. Step Four Tough, self-critical people don't allow themselves the indulgence of believing in luck. They take responsibility for everything. They think winners make their own luck. But they don't, for the most part. Luck is a genuine feature of existence. We're robbing ourselves of fair consolation by believing that we're entirely in control, and therefore entirely to blame when we crash. Step Five You're not only your achievements. Status and material success are one bit of you, but there are others as well. Those who loved you in childhood knew this, and in their best moments, helped you to feel it. Rehearse the internalized voices of all those who've been kind to you. Bathe in the memory of a love, independent of achievement. Step Six &quot;It seems it will never end.&quot; That's not the truth. It's just how a crisis feels. You need to reduce expectations to zero for a time. Take each new hour as it comes. And, without being banal, what you need most of all is some rest.<br />Questions:<br />1. Tell us your experience of failure story in your life. How did you heal it?<br />2. Many people set up the scale of high challenges for themselves; it could become “an excessive version of self-criticism”. How to make the balance “Self Compassion and self-criticism”<br />3. Form the media, we saw everyone is rich, famous and successful; we chase it and get a lot of pressure. What are your opinions to see this kind of news?<br /><br />13 Study Tips  (13個讀書才有效的方法)<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/49446?ref=translated">https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/49446?ref=translated</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Our brain can potentially memorize 2.5 petabytes of information, which is roughly the equivalent of 3 million hours of YouTube videos. In order to use some of that staggering capacity a little more effectively when you learn, here are some tips that are based on widely accepted research by neuroscientists and learning experts. “Spaced Repetition&quot; To maximise your learning, study short but often. Neuroscientist proved that synapses, the million billion connections in your brain that make you remember and understand stuff, grow mainly at night when you are asleep. This means that it is more productive to study regularly with sleeping breaks in between. Try it! Practice something for 15 minutes every day and you'll be surprised by your progress within just weeks. “Find Your Own Style” While listening to the history teacher, Tom scribbles images and Jane finishes 1 kilo of nuts. Some enjoy watching videos over reading books, others study with friends and some like sitting in silence among a million books. Everybody is different. “Good Night's Sleep” Sleep and dreams are vital to processing and storing new information. A Harvard study showed that students who had a good night’s sleep remembered their study materials 35% better than those who studied in the morning to take a test in the evening. “Focus!” If you tend to procrastinate, which means that you tend to switch from doing something hard like studying maths to something easy like browsing the web, protect yourself from distraction. One way of doing this is to shut down your mobile phone or go to a quite place like a library. “Pomodoro Technique” Set a timer to 25 minutes when you focus entirely on your studies. When the timer rings, relax for 5 minutes. If you want to continue just set the timer again. The small breaks in between are relaxing and motivating to keep going. “Hard Stuff First” Do the things that are difficult first. Because if you are like most people, you have the strongest willpower in the morning. Once you are done with the hard stuff you will feel better for the rest of the day and probably more motivated to get other things done. “Exercise, Meditate and Converse” There are few activities proven to grow your brain however physical exercise, regular meditation and good conversations apparently do exactly that. They lead to the creation of new neurons inside your brain and therefore grow its potential. “Go Places!” You can create deeper memories of a subject by learning in a richer environment that offers more visual clues. In an experiment two groups of students had to remember random words. One group changed the classroom while studying, the other didn’t. The group that studied in two different rooms (one was small and windowless, the other big and bright) was 40% more likely to recall the words later. “Take Fun Seriously” Whatever it is, find a fun way to practice. Modern learning science believes that positive emotions are very important for increasing your learning potential. So do yourself a favour and have a good time! “Space Your Studies” In order to remember things for a longer time, repeat the material in spaced intervals. Facts or vocabularies for example are best learned if you review them the first time 1-2 days after the initial study and then again after 1 week and after 1 month. “30% Read 70% Recite” If you have one hour to learn to recite a poem or prepare for a speech spend 20 Minutes of the time on studying the text and 40 minutes on practicing to recite. This ratio usually leads to the best results. In the case of an emergency, put a glass of water next to you. Take a sip whenever you lose it <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> “Instant Self-Test” After you study finish up with a quick quiz. Immediate recall in form of a test or a short summary on what you’ve just learned can increase retention by as much as 30%. Because it’s much harder for your brain to reflect than to read, that extra effort creates deeper traces in your memory. “Don’t Force it” Motivation is like hunger. You cannot force yourself to be motivated just like you can’t tell someone else to be hungry. So if you are not hungry right now, don’t worry. Take a break and do something else.<br /><br />Questions:<br />1.	Are you a good at studying person? If yes, share your own style. If not, why reasons? How to solve? <br />2.	13 tips from our article, which one is useful? Why? Any new tips else?<br />3.	How to prepare your work, test, project or multitasks efficiently at the limit time?</div>
