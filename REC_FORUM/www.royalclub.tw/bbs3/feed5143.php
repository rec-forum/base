<span style="font-weight: bold">Taiwanese Night Market Culture: Eat, Drink, and Be Daring</span><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.wanderingeducators.com/best/traveling/taiwanese-night-market-culture-eat-drink-and-be-daring.html">https://www.wanderingeducators.com/best ... aring.html</a><!-- m --><br />Submitted by Casey Siemasko<br />  <br />I’ll never forget my first visit to a night market in Taiwan. It was a total affront on all senses. Too many people jostling for space; too many unrecognizable odors drifting through the air; too many animal organs skewered and on display for growling bellies. I elbowed my way through the crowds, searching for an English menu or a familiar food, covered in sweat from the summer humidity. Then I left twenty minutes later. Still suffering from jetlag and feeling a bit apprehensive about my travel plans, the entire experience was too much culture shock to handle. <br /> <br />Despite the unsuccessful occurrence, I returned a second and third time, prepared for the chaos and energy. Eventually, I found myself enjoying the experience a bit more. Before long, I was electing to visit night markets on a regular basis, lamenting over the lack of great night markets in the city I called home. It took a while, but I finally got the night market scene. <br /><br />The problem with my first night market venture wasn’t simply that I was tired or overwhelmed, but that my expectations were set up entirely wrong. I didn’t understand the importance of night market culture, and I wasn’t able to appreciate the bustling frenzy and positive energy that made them so charming in the first place. But once I learned more about Taiwan’s culture and food scene, all of that changed.<br /><br />Night markets in Taiwan date back hundreds of years, to when simple peddlers bore their food for sale across their shoulders. Later, quite sensibly, night markets had a close correlation with temples. After all, where people gather, there will be food. During Taoist festivals, venders would bring their snacks and set up stalls nearby, representing some of the first makeshift markets. Soon artisans joined them, selling handicrafts. With inexpensive prices that the lower and middle class could afford, night markets became a staple of life, not just for the food but also as a place to gather and socialize.<br /> <br />The practice stuck, and even in the midst of today’s mega-malls and westernization, night markets retain a strong hold within Taiwanese culture. This is partly due to the emphasis on xiaochi, which can be translated semi-accurately as small eats. Taiwanese have a strong place in their hearts for xiaochi, and cook variations of the snacks during different festivals of the year; however, these snacks are often available year-round at a night market. Additionally, many night markets have their own specialty snacks to offer, reason enough for Taiwanese to seek them out. Along with the food scene, the markets boast clothes, electronics, and carnival games—it’s seemingly possible to purchase anything at a single market!<br /><br />anything at a single market!<br /> <br />Given all that night markets encompass, it’s no wonder that they are such a large part of the culture and a top tourist attraction. If you’re ready to give your first night market a go, here are some survival tips to keep in mind:<br />1. Don’t arrive hungry.<br />Yes, there is a lot of food to try at a night market, but extreme hunger typically doesn’t mix well with long lines and unrecognizable treats. Have a bit of an appetizer before you go so you can take your time once there.<br /><br />2. Find the longest line.<br />The locals know where to eat; if there is a long line, chances are that it’s because there is some seriously good grub on the other end of it.<br /><br />3. Pointing is acceptable.<br />Mandarin is a hard language, but luckily the Taiwanese are very friendly and willing to read your body language to understand what it is you want. If something looks good but you have no idea how to use your words, don’t be afraid to point and smile.<br /><br />4. Remember the smaller night markets.<br />I chose one of the largest night markets in Taipei for my first excursion, and then complained when it was crowded. Remember the smaller night markets; they are everywhere, and often more charming than their larger counterparts.<br /><br />Of course, the most important part of a night market is the food! While you’re ambling, keep an eye out for these:<br />1. Oyster Omelets<br /> <br />They were recently voted tourists’ favorite snack food, and for good reason. Consisting of eggs, oysters, and potato starch, this is one chewy treat you don’t want to miss.<br /><br />2. Pearl Milk Tea<br /> <br />More commonly known as ‘bubble tea’ in the west, this drink is made up of black tea, milk powder, and small, chewy tapioca balls (along with a heaping pump of sugar syrup). Be forewarned: these drinks are highly addictive and can pack on the calories.<br /><br />3. Stinky Tofu<br /> <br />Perhaps Taiwan’s most famous dish, you need only follow your nose to find it. Tofu is fermented, fried and served street-side with chili sauce and pickled vegetables.<br />4. Fresh Squid<br /> <br />Skewered squid is a night market classic, lightly marinated and cooked over a coal-fired grill.<br />5. Chicken Hearts<br /> <br />Feeling daring? Why not bite down on a chicken heart? No part of the animal goes to waste, including livers, intestines, stomachs, heads, and hearts. Try them skewered, fried or barbecued.<br /><br />6. Duck Tongues<br /> <br />So the hearts weren’t adventurous enough? How about a duck tongue? It’s considered a fatty delicacy, and comes deep-fried on a stick. Watch out for the numerous bones inside.<br /><br />7. Beef Noodles<br />I’ve saved the best for last. If there’s one thing you can’t leave Taiwan without trying, it’s beef noodles. Taiwan’s national dish, there is even an annual beef noodle competition where chefs compete to create the most scrumptious variation. Each restaurant has its own recipe, so try it again and again!<br /> <br />There are over 100 night markets in Taiwan, but these are some of the better-known ones to try:<br />1. Shihlin Night Market: One of Taiwan’s most famous and largest night markets. Be on the look out for fried chicken, dumplings, sausages, oyster omelets, stinky tofu, and pearl milk tea—all the classics.<br /><br />2. Keelung Night Market: Its location near the sea makes this a great place to try fresh and local seafood.<br /><br />3. Fengjia Night Market: it is Taichung's largest and most popular night market; For many it is probably even Taiwan's most favorite market that was once established along Wen-hua road , then expanded to Fengjia road, Fushin road, Xian street etc.The area provides an assortment of shops to browse through which have Food/drink stands, clothing stores, restaurants, games to play and most notably, lots of snacks to please any palate.<br /><br />4. Liouhe Night Market: Located in Kaohsiung, this is southern Taiwan’s most famous market, boasting stall after stall of food, games, and retail.<br /><br />DISCUSSIONS:<br />Q1. Why are night markets so fascinating in Taiwan now?<br />Q2. Which night market is your favorite one? And What is your favorite food or snack over there?<br />Q3. What changes does night market experience from before until nowadays?<br />Q4. Could a night market reflect local commercial level? And what influence?<br /><br />=========================================================================================<br />10 Motivational Tips to Keep You Healthy<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.webmd.com/diet/obesity/features/10-motivational-tips-to-keep-you-healthy#1">http://www.webmd.com/diet/obesity/featu ... -healthy#1</a><!-- m --><br />By Debra Fulghum Bruce, PhD<br /><br />Find yourself losing interest in exercising and eating a healthy diet? Maybe you were gung ho for a few weeks and then your get-in-shape determination quickly faded -- and you went back to your old, bad health habits.<br /><br />What if instead of making mega-changes with the all-or-nothing approach to weight loss and good health, you resolve to tackle a few simple changes at a time? Studies show that the health and weight loss habits that have the best chance of lasting are the ones that call for minor, doable changes.<br />According to Penny Kris-Etherton, PhD, a nutrition professor at Penn State University, the key is to take small, positive steps and move ahead consistently. &quot;People need to be realistic about the changes they can achieve.&quot;<br /><br />Consider the following ten motivational tips to help you make small, positive steps each day.<br />1. Feel Good About Yourself Today<br />Be sure the people around you make you feel good about you -- no matter what your size or health condition. In addition, if close friends encourage you to smoke, overeat, or drink too much, find some new friends who have good health habits and also want a healthier you.<br /><br />Elaine Magee, MPH, Rd, author of more than 20 books, says don't get hung up on pounds or what size dress you are wearing.&quot;Instead, focus on being healthy from the inside out,&quot; Magee says. &quot;Eat well, and exercise regularly. And remember that you can be sexy and look and feel fabulous and not be thin.&quot;<br /><br />2. Rethink Your Role Model<br />Barbie's still the first role model many young girls are drawn to. But let's be honest. For most of us to look like Barbie, we'd have to be nearly 6 feet tall, shrink our waist size by 8 inches, move the excess inches up to our chests, and then pose in the &quot;suck in the gut/high heel&quot; position all the time. Come on! There's a better way to live our lives than pretending.<br /><br />Select positive role models. Choose role models that help you feel good about who you are, rather than ones who make you feel bad. Find a female role model who is strong, healthy -- and real!<br /><br />3. Know What Makes You Overeat<br />The key to staying motivated is to know where your problem areas are and have a plan for dealing with them. Do you use food to cope with disappointment, rejection, boredom, or even personal success?<br /><br />Brainstorm some healthier ways to cope with mood swings that do not involve food. In addition, control your environment to avoid bingeing on high-calorie foods when you do feel disappointed, rejected, or bored. Keep your kitchen stocked with lots of healthy options such as chunks of fruits and veggies, low-fat yogurts, flavored waters, and sugar-free gum.<br />4. Make Simple Daily Change<br />Who said health-related lifestyle changes had to be all or nothing? Start small and make a few simple weight loss and exercise changes each day. These small changes can add up over time to give you a big health boost. Here are some suggestions:<br />Add 5 more grams of fiber to your daily meal plan.<br />Cut out refined carbohydrates, such as white bread, white rice, and sweets<br />Avoid foods with trans-fats<br />Add two more servings of veggies at lunch and dinner<br />Drink three more glasses of water each day<br />Add 10 minutes of walking to your daily exercise regimen<br />Take a break every hour at work and walk 500 steps in place (2,000 steps burns 100 calories)<br />Wake up 15 minutes earlier and walk before work<br /><br />5. Find a Cheering Section<br />We all need a cheering section -- having to account to someone else gives you a reason to hang in there when you can't muster determination from within. It doesn't matter where the support comes from -- a spouse, friend, co-worker, or online &quot;buddy,&quot; or others.<br /><br />Think of five people who might be in your cheering section. Talk to these people about giving you support and holding you accountable as you work to reach your weight loss or health goals. Call upon your cheering section when you're having trouble sticking with good health habits. When you do reach small weight loss or exercise goals, invite your support group to celebrate with you.<br /><br />6. Forgive Yourself<br />If you slip up on vacation and overeat, drink too much, or fail to exercise -- forgive yourself. Don't beat yourself up! Instead, say, &quot;I really enjoyed my vacation,&quot; and let it go at that. Allowing yourself time to enjoy a few indulgences occasionally is OK. If you start to feel guilty for having dessert on a special night out, forgive yourself and start back on your more disciplined program the next day.<br /><br />7. Never Go Hungry<br />Katherine Tallmadge, MA, RD, author of Diet Simple, says the biggest cause of overeating is undereating. &quot;People go too long without eating, and then pig out when they are ravenously hungry.&quot; Rigid diets don't work for anyone. Include planned snacks in your daily diet to prevent binges. Make sure you allow for treats once a week without feeling guilty. Have a brownie every Friday, and enjoy every bite.<br /><br />8. Remember That Change Takes Time<br />It's easy to see thin people and think how lucky they are. But here's the truth: If a thin person is over 30 -- or even over 20 -- chances are they are working hard at being thin each day. Learn from them. Find out how they stay thin. Is it through more exercise? Eating fewer snacks?<br /><br />According to Kathy Kater, a LSW and psychotherapist in St. Paul, Minn., the research on body diversity is conclusive. &quot;Even if we all ate the same optimal, wholesome diet and exercised to the same high degree of physical fitness, we would still be very diverse in our shapes. Some quite thin and some quite big, but most in the middle.&quot;<br /><br />Make the commitment to change some lifestyle habits and allow yourself plenty of time to see your goal. In addition, accept the fact that your body is meant to be a certain size -- even if that size isn't skinny -- and feel good about it.<br /><br />9. Move Around More Today; Sit Less<br />Make healthy choices by being more physically active. Park at the end of the lot when grocery shopping. Change your TV channel manually. Take the stairs at work. Go on a long walk with your kids or grandkids. Raining outside? Walk or run in place while watching TV. No excuses!<br /><br />According to Christopher Wharton, PhD, a certified personal trainer and researcher with the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University, the more time spent exercising and the more vigorous the exercise, the more calories you will burn.<br /><br />&quot;Studies have shown that with increases in exercise time, the elevation in resting metabolic rate is prolonged,&quot; Wharton says. Make a deliberate effort to move more and sit less to increase physical activity and good health.<br /><br />10. Celebrate Each Day's Journey<br />In the midst of your exercise and weight loss goals, don't forget to enjoy each day's journey. Most women agree that their lives and dreams for the future are so intertwined with reaching a specific goal or destination that any derived pleasure is disregarded. Problems arise when the &quot;goal&quot; becomes the sole purpose of living and overshadows our daily lives.<br /><br />While having healthy weight loss/exercise goals are important, make sure to take time to celebrate each day's journey. Live for the moment and savor some of life's simple pleasures -- every day.<br /><br />DISCUSSIONS:<br />Q1. What can you do to improve your health? Do you do anything to stay healthy?<br />Q2. How often do you have a health check?<br />Q3. Have you ever been in poor or ill health?<br />Q4. Who are the healthiest people in the world and why are they so healthy?<br />Q5. What are the best and worst jobs for your health?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">dora</a> — Thu Jul 20, 2017 11:23 pm</p><hr />
