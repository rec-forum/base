<span style="font-weight: bold">Host : Prisca</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The prodigal son</span><br />A certain man had two sons.<br /><br />The younger asked his father to give him his portion of father's property. <br /><br />Not long after, the youngest son took a journey and spent all his money in foolish living.<br /><br />When everything was gone, he put himself into the hands of his relative who sent him to feed the pigs.<br /><br />He was so hungry to eat pigs' food, and no one gave him anything.<br /><br />But when he came to his senses, he said, &quot;how rich my father is.&quot; The younger son wanted to go home and wanted to said to his father &quot; Father, I have done wrong, against heaven and in your eyes. I am no longer good enough to be named your son: make me like one of your servants.<br /><br />When the youngest son went to his father. But while he was still far away, his father saw him and was moved with pity for him and went quickly and took him in his arms and gave him a kiss.<br /><br />The yongest son said to him, Father, I have done wrong in your eyes: I am no longer good enough to be named your son.....&quot;<br /><br /> But the father stopped him and said to his servants, &quot; Get out the first robe quickly, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet. And get the fat young ox and put it to death, and let us have a feast, and be glad.For this, my son, who was dead, is living again; he had gone away from me, and has come back&quot;. They were full of joy.<br /><br />Now the oldest son came and drew near to the house. He heard music and dancing,<br /><br />He inquired what happened. He became angry and said to his father, &quot;Behold, so many years I have been slaving for you and have never neglected a command of yours, and you have never given me a goat that I might be merry with my friends,  But when this youngest son came, who devoured your living with aharlots, you slaughtered for him the fattened calf.<br /><br />The father said to him, Child, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours. But we had to be merry and rejoice, because your brother was dead and has come to life, and he was lost and has been found.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Recording of the story</span><br /><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/rmct0i1wq3q177q/5956160677514.m4a?dl=0" class="postlink">https://www.dropbox.com/s/rmct0i1wq3q177q/5956160677514.m4a?dl=0</a><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Section 1 - Role Play</span><br /><br />According to the above story , the people at each group need to create their own role play at table . Then you may perform it in public by the host's appointment.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Section 2 - Your own impromptu speech sharing at table.</span><br /><br />There are 3 figures in this story. Please share at table  about your past experiences of being 3 above figures by composing an &quot;impromptu&quot; speech in 2 minutes. Then share it in front as volunteers. PS-The host will give each of you 2 mins to think.<br /><br />1. A forgiving and loving father - Would you like to be a loving and forgiving one , or revenge on him when someone betraies or offends you?<br /><br />2. A repenting one  - Would you like to often take lead to say sorry to others, or you's like to always defend yourself when you make a mistake and are corrected by others?<br /><br />3. The oldest son - would you like to be a jealous one when someone gains a success? Or Were you envied by others when you gained a sucess?<br /><br /><br />第一段<br />&quot;戲劇&quot;表演 role play<br /><br />每1組都演同樣的戲劇,然後抽簽選一或二組上台表演<br />PS，由各桌組員自由發揮劇本內容， 而且不能寫下劇本，只能用口頭敘述 這樣就可以充分用口頭來練習英文<br /><br />第2段<br />&quot;&quot;&quot;即興演講 &quot;&quot;<br />根據以上故事主持人給題目，並給各桌的各組員只有1分鐘可以思考，然後馬上就要說出一個2分鐘的即興演講<br /><br />如果你們來時 沒有看過這個故事 不用擔心主持人會說這個故事<br />然後請各桌每一個組員互說這個故事給對方聽，<br />敘述故事是練習口頭英文很好的一個方式<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=49">josh</a> — Mon May 01, 2017 8:43 pm</p><hr />
