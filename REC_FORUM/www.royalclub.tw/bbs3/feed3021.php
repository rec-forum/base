Host : Danny<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Session 1 - See what you do when Facing with a dilemma</span><br />Should a baker make a wedding cake for a same-six couple if it goes against his religion faith? See the real case in the US.<br />The following story is from CNN STUDENT NEWS on Dec 5, 2017.<br /><br />AZUZ: The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments yesterday in a closely watched case that involves some major issues in America. One is the rights of same sex couples. Another is religious freedom. The courts scheduled the arguments to last an hour, but they went over that, an indication of how significant the case is. <br />It involves the owner of a bakery that opened in 1993 and two men who requested a wedding cake for their marriage in 2012. At that time, same sex marriage wasn`t legal in Colorado. The week would have been for their wedding in another state. <br />Following is a balanced report on what happened in the words of those involved. <br />(BEIN VIDEOTAPE) <br />DAVID MULLINS: Like any couple getting married, we had a million details to penalize. On this particular day, it was special to us. We had a binder full of ideas. <br />JACK PHILLIPS, OWNER, MASTERPIECE CAKESHOP: They said that they were here to look for wedding cakes. <br />MULLINS: As soon as we sat down with the owner, he asked who the cake was for. <br />PHILLIPS: They were sitting at our wedding desk, had my wedding book open with wedding pictures in front of them. <br />MULLINS: We told him it was for us. <br />PHILLIPS: Right away, I know that it`s not a cake that I would be able to create for them. Told them, sorry, guys, I don`t do cakes for same sex weddings. They looked at me, like, what do you mean? <br />MULLINS: We were horrified and just embarrassed and hurt. <br />PHILLIPS: I will make you birthday cake, shower cakes, cookies, brownies. Basically, I will sell you anything else in the store. But that`s just the cake that I can`t do and the conversation didn`t go any further. They got mad, stood up, stormed out of the shop. <br />MULLINS: In the parking lot, we were -- we were very emotional. It`s embarrassing to admit, but I cried. <br />PHILLIPS: I didn`t want to use my artistic talents to create something that went against my Christian faith. <br />MULLINS: We haven`t spoken to Jack since this all began. <br />SUBTITLE: Craig and Mullins, represented by the ACLU, already won win the lowers courts of Colorado. <br />Their case made it all the way to the Supreme Court. <br />MULLINS: This case is about more than us and it`s not about cakes. It`s about the right of gay people to receive equal service. <br />PHILLIPS: I don`t see this as a case of discrimination. Discrimination is saying you people are not welcomed in my shop. But I always, always, always welcome everybody in my shop. They`re just an event I don`t create cakes for, this was one of them -- but the two gentlemen that came are welcome on my shop any day. <br />To turn away somebody because of their sexual orientation, that would be discrimination. To turn away an event, the opportunity to create for an event is not discrimination. <br />CHARLIE CRAIG: This isn`t about our artistic expression. I don`t feel like we asked for a piece of art, or for him to make a statement, we simply asked him for a cake and he denied that to us simply because of who we are. <br />PHILLIPS: I feel like I`m being compelled to create artwork for an event, an inherently religious event that goes against my faith. And I`m being compelled to do so under threat of penalty of jail time and fines for not complying. <br />MULLINS: Religion is an extremely important part of many people`s lives. That`s why it`s protected under the Constitution. But you cannot practice your religion in a way that demeans others or excludes them from public life. <br />PHILLIPS: Fundamentally, I believe that marriage is a picture of Christ in the church and that god designed marriage to be a man and a woman. <br />MULLINS: A win in the Supreme Court would validate and affirm what the Colorado courts have decided at every level, which is that Masterpiece Cakeshop discriminated against us and denied us service based upon who we are. <br />PHILLIPS: The Colorado Civil Rights Commission ruled that for now on, I have to make cakes for same sex weddings and rather than disobey that ruling, we decided that a way around that, obeying the law and the ruling, would be to try and continue business without making wedding cakes at all. <br />SUBTITLE: Recently, the Department of Justice expressed support for Masterpiece Cakeshop`s position in a legal brief. <br />PHILLIPS: The hardship has been substantial, sacrificing that aspect of our business. That was 40 percent of our business. The day these two gentlemen came in, I had 10 employees working for me. Now, I have four, including myself. <br />MULLINS: If the court rules against us, it would open the door to many forms of discrimination that had long been outlawed in our society, and not just regarding gay people but against many protected groups. <br />PHILLIPS: I am hoping that at the end of this, I do have the option of making wedding cakes, but this case is much bigger than just Jack Phillips get to make wedding cakes. This case is about our fundamental freedoms, freedom of speech, freedom of artistic expression, freedom of exercise -- <br />free exercise of religion in our day to day lives. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />1. What would you do If you were the backer in the case? How about the rejected couple or the Supreme Court’s judge? try debating and tell us why, please put yourself in each of their shoes.<br />2.. Do you have any ideas to make a comprehensive decision to balance all the arguments and satisfy all the people for the case? Explain how.<br />3. Are laws the only solution to the dilemma? could empathy being used in the case?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Session 2 - Your social media &quot;likes&quot; expose more than you think!</span><br />Please see the following video as the attached website.<br /><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/jennifer_golbeck_the_curly_fry_conundrum_why_social_media_likes_say_more_than_you_might_think/transcript" class="postlink">https://www.ted.com/talks/jennifer_golbeck_the_curly_fry_conundrum_why_social_media_likes_say_more_than_you_might_think/transcript</a><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />1.Big Data makes money for corporations in which they try to uses and collects our personal information through social media for the sake of promoting their business. <br />Do they defy social morality or not? <br />Should they pay for consumers to get approval of using their info.? <br />2.
