The car has been tested in Canada, where the country’s aviation authority has authorised its use.<br />Like Kitty Hawk, BlackFly could perhaps be more accurately described as a human-carrying drone. It is not designed to be driven on roads.<br />The vehicle carries one person in a small cockpit, powered by “eight propulsion systems, spread across two wings”. <br />It works best, Opener says, when taking off and landing from grassy surfaces.<br />'Total command'<br />“Watching BlackFly take flight just blew me away,” said Darren Pleasance, director of the US Experimental Aircraft Association. “I’ve never seen anything like it.”<br />While the vehicle will not require a pilot's licence, Opener said as a precaution riders would have to undergo a training programme in order to become acquainted. <br />“Even though not required by Federal Aviation Administration regulations, BlackFly operators will be required to successfully complete the FAA Private Pilot written examination and also complete company-mandated vehicle familiarisation and operator training,&quot; it said.<br />Opener’s chief executive Marcus Leng said the on-board controls offered “instant gratification”.<br />“You have total command of three-dimensional space,” he told CBS News correspondent John Blackstone.<br />“When you press the thumb-stick to climb, you have absolute full control. When you stop in the middle of the air and go off the joystick, the aircraft freezes. <br />“And when I say freezes… it literally freezes in the air.”<br />BlackFly can also fly autonomously, Mr Leng said.<br />'Will they crash? Probably'<br />Opener joins a long list of companies chasing the ultimate science fiction dream of a flying car, and thanks to rapid improvements in drone capabilities, that future seems closer than ever. <br />As well as BlackFly and Kitty Hawk, companies such as Uber are also seeking to get into the flying car market - if indeed there ever is one.<br />The Hiller Aviation Museum in Northern California is a graveyard of failed attempts to create a flying car.<br />But the museum’s head of operations, Willie Turner, believes this latest batch might be on to something - as long as aviation authorities can accommodate the new ideas.<br />“Now we have the technology,” he said. <br />“But the regulations are ‘well you can’t do this, you can’t do that’. They don’t understand it.”<br />He added: “Now will they crash? Probably, but cars crash every day. <br />“You know it’s not going to be foolproof but it will be much better than the current system we have now.&quot;<br />Question<br />1. Would you like to buy a flying car? What are the dangers of flying cars?<br />2. How would flying cars change our lives? Where would you go in a flying car?<br />3. Should people need a license to fly the car? What rules would be needed for flying cars? <br />4. With your imagination, describe a new era of transport.<br />5. What questions would you like to ask the car's designers?<br /><br />Article 2<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Warning over suntan lotion application</span><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-44936124">https://www.bbc.com/news/health-44936124</a><!-- m --><br />People are getting less than half the sun protection they expect from suntan lotions, according to research.<br />But the problem isn't the lotion, it's our slapdash application of it, King's College London scientists say. <br />In theory, using sun protection factor (SPF) 15 sunscreen should be enough to stop sun damage. <br />But in reality, people need SPF 30 or 50 to be safe, say the study authors, who carried out experiments with volunteers in their lab. <br />It comes as temperatures are set to reach 33C in London on Thursday afternoon amid reports of the heat placing a strain on some health services.<br />Nick Scriven, president of the Society of Acute Medicine, said one doctor had told him their hospital had been busy at the weekend, with patients needing treatment for conditions linked to dehydration, including chest and urine infections.<br />Kim Sunley, national officer at the Royal College of Nursing, said nurses had reported temperatures in excess of 30C on some hospital wards.<br />She told the BBC: &quot;We know wards are reaching over 30C, nurses are feeling sick, dizzy, having problems with their concentration. <br />&quot;And that then does have an impact on how they care for their patients, making decisions around drugs calculations and just generally doing a physical occupation.&quot;<br />Visits to the NHS Choices website for heat-related health advice so far this month are up nearly 450% compared to July last year. <br />How to apply it<br />Factor 50 lotion applied in the typical way would, at best, provide 40% of the expected protection, said Prof Anthony Young, whose team measured how much protection people got from wearing different amounts of suntan lotions with varying SPF strengths. <br />Sunscreen needs to be applied thickly enough, which many of us fail to do. <br />SPF ratings are based on the assumption that a 2mg blob will cover 1 sq cm of skin.<br />That means you should apply at least six full teaspoons (36g) to cover the body of an average adult.<br />More than half a teaspoon to:<br />	each arm <br />	the face, neck and ears<br />More than one teaspoon to:<br />	each leg<br />	chest and abdomen<br />	back <br />Areas such as the sides of the neck, temples and ears are commonly missed, so take extra care and apply liberally.<br />It is also easy to forget to reapply sunscreen as often as necessary. <br />The British Association of Dermatologists advises: <br />	Put it on 15 to 30 minutes before going out in the sun, to allow it to dry<br />	Top up again shortly after heading outdoors, to cover any missed patches and ensure you're wearing a sufficient layer<br />	Reapply at least every two hours and immediately after swimming or if it has rubbed off<br />Some lotions say they are water resistant, meaning they retain some sun protection properties after immersion. <br />However, up to 85% of a product can be removed by towel drying, so you should reapply after swimming, sweating, or any other vigorous or abrasive activity.<br />Another important factor is the reflection of the Sun's rays, which can greatly increase the power of the radiation: snow by up to 85% increase, sand by up to 17% and water by up to 5%.<br />What to do if you get sunburnt?<br />	Get out of the sun as soon as possible and head indoors or to a shady area<br />	Cool your skin with a cold bath or shower, wet sponge or cold flannel<br />	Use lotions containing aloe vera to soothe and moisturise the burned skin<br />	Drink plenty of fluids to cool down and prevent dehydration<br />	Take painkillers, such as ibuprofen or paracetamol, to relieve pain <br />	Cover up the affected areas of skin until it has fully healed<br />	Seek medical advice if you have blistering, chills, a fever or dizziness <br />People with fair skin that burns easily, many moles or freckles, red or fair hair and light-coloured eyes are most at risk of sun damage.<br />Sunscreens should not be used to stay outside longer or just to avoid more reliable protective measures such as clothing and shade.<br />Nina Goad, of the British Association of Dermatologists, said: &quot;This research demonstrates why it's so important to choose an SPF of 30 or more. <br />&quot;It also shows why we shouldn't rely on sunscreen alone for sun protection, but we should also use clothing and shade.&quot;<br />Public Health England advises people try to keep cool and take shelter.<br />&quot;To beat the heat, try to keep out of the sun from 11:00 to 15:00, walk in the shade if you can, apply sunscreen and wear a hat if you have to go out in the heat,&quot; it says.<br />Question<br />1. What do you think of suntans? Why do people want to get a suntan? Is a tan healthy looking?<br />2. What do you do in a heatwave? How dangerous is it being in the sun?<br />3. Are people who live in sunny countries happier?<br />4. Name some bad things about suntans. What can you do for sunburn?<br />5. What would happen if the world gets warmer?<br />6. Do you prefer the heat or the cold?<br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00-7:30 free talk<br />(Session 1)<br />7:30-7:35 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />7:35~ 8:15 discussion session (40 mins)<br />(Session 2)<br />8:15 ~9:00pm discussion session (45 mins)<br />9:00~9:30 free talk<br /><br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
