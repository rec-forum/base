			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">[url]12/21 How Taiwan, the fastest ageing population, is responding/ How to stay physically and mentally fit (Host: Jason)<br />[/url]</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Section I:<br /></span><span style="font-weight: bold">The coming of a “super-aged society”: How Taiwan, the fastest ageing population, is responding<br /></span>http://en.seinsights.asia/2017/06/12/the-coming-of-a-super-aged-society-how-taiwan-the-fastest-ageing-population-is-responding/<br /><br />Birth, ageing, illness and death – the four bitters of life – once this journey has begun, there is no one that can turn back. But the transitions from ageing to illness, and from illness to death, are not necessarily instant, and in the end depend on whether one can invigorate body and mind in spite of physical changes, as well as whether the complete preparation of long-term care can accompany physical changes.<br /><br />Every country in the world is currently facing the problem of an ageing population, but the issue is particularly serious in developed countries, due to prolonged life expectancy and a reduced birth rate. This can be seen from the “ageing index”, that is, the proportion of the population aged 65 or above divided by the population under the age of 14. The higher the index, the more serious is the extent of ageing.<br /><br />In developed countries, the average ageing index is 106%. When it comes to that of individual countries, Japan’s is 200%, Germany’s is 162%, Canada’s is 100%, France’s is 95%, the United Kingdom’s is 94%, Korea’s is 93%, Singapore’s is 69%, and so on. In contrast, developing countries average 21%, with China at 59%, Malaysia at 23%, the Philippines at 12%, and so on.<br /><br />In the case of Taiwan, its ageing index is 92%. But from the evidence, Taiwan’s rate of ageing is like an unstoppable train, with the speed surpassing that of any developed country.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Four key data trends indicating a super-aged society</span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">1.	Nine-year countdown to a super-aged society</span><br />As early as 1993, the proportion of elderly people in Taiwan reached 7%, making it an “ageing” society. This rate is expected to reach 14% by 2018, when it will become an “aged” society. By 2025, more than 20% of the population will cross the threshold, making Taiwan a “super-aged” society, where one in every five people will be elderly.<br /><br />Between turning from “ageing” to “aged”, Taiwan only has 25 years, which is a much faster transition than Germany’s 40 years, the United Kingdom’s 47 years, the United States’ 72 years and France’s 127 years.<br /><br />Even more surprising is that the transition from “aged” to “super-aged” is estimated to only take 7 years in Taiwan, which is much faster than Europe and the United States’ 20 to 50 years, as well as faster than all East Asian countries.<br />(Generally, people aged 65 years of age or older are defined as elderly, and the ratio of the elderly population to the total population is used as the ageing index).<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">2.	In 45 years, an average of 1.2 young people will need to support every elderly person</span><br />About 35 years ago, Taiwan’s “old-age dependency ratio” was 6.9%, meaning that every 14.5 young adults needed to support one elderly person. However, this figure had more than doubled to 16.2% by 2014, meaning that every 6.2 young adults needed to care for one elderly person. It is estimated that in 2061, 45 years from now, this will surge to 81.4%, when every 1.2 young adults will need to bear the weight of one elderly person, such that the ratio will be close to 1:1.<br />(The “old-age dependency ratio” refers to the proportion of every 100 adults (15 to 64 years) needed to support the elderly population.)<br /><br />Such a trend is closely related to a “low birth rate”. In 2061, it is expected that the number of young people under 15 will have reduced by 1.7 million and the number of young and middle-aged people by 8.31 million. On the contrary, the elderly population will increase by 4.54 million, among whom a large proportion of people with disabilities will be in need of full-time care.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">3.	Elderly people with disabilities continue to increase in number</span><br />In 2015, the number of people with disabilities over the age of 5 in Taiwan was 760,000, of which the elderly accounted for nearly 500,000. By 2031, it is expected that the total population with disabilities will increase to 1.2 million people, of which the elderly will account for 950,000. In 2060, the disabled population will rise to 1.96 million, of which the elderly will make up 1.8 million, more than 90%.<br />The proportion of elderly people among those with disabilities is gradually increasing. Although this indicates increased life expectancy, it does not necessarily mean that people are in good health.<br />(The term “physical or mental disability” refers to a physical or mental function that is partially or completely lost, resulting in the need for assistance in daily life.)<br /><br />4.	The average time spent bedridden is up to 7 years, while it is only 14 days in Nordic countries<br />In recent years, the life expectancy of the people of Taiwan has been increasing annually. In 2015, the national average was 80.2 years old, with males at 77.01 years old and females at 83.62 years old.<br /><br />However, the level of health has not kept up. The Taiwanese average time bed-ridden is up to 7 years, whereas people in Nordic countries spend an average of 2 weeks bedridden before death. Confined to bed for an extended period, people with disabilities can only rely on the care of their families or caregivers, thus becoming a heavy burden.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">“Active Ageing”, helping the elderly enjoy life</span><br />With an ageing population and a low birth rate, the population structure will gradually become an inverted pyramid. However, if an “Active Ageing” environment can be created, it may be possible to step on the brakes before the crisis.<br /><br />In 2002, the World Health Organisation (WHO) advocated the concept of social support for the elderly through family, community, peer and social channels. In Taiwan today, there are already many social enterprises that have been established in response with all kinds of innovative services, such as the Hondao Senior Citizen’s Welfare Foundation, iHealth Express, Duofu Care &amp; Services, and MABO Technology.<br /><br />The Hondao Senior Citizen’s Welfare Foundation organises a series of “forever young” activities on a regular basis to encourage the elderly to show off their vitality. In addition, the concept of “All in One”, introduced from Denmark, allows caregivers to form a highly mobile team to take care of people in need. At the same time, Hondao has broken convention by changing the traditional piece rate system to a monthly salary, as well as given caregivers a more visible ladder for career promotion.<br /><br />iHealth Express is the first “home-visit pharmacy service”. No matter whether the chronically ill live in urban or rural areas, pharmacists personally visit them in their homes to give advice related to medication knowledge, health information, and eating habits. This initiative is hoped to prevent patients neglecting treatment due to travel fatigue.<br /><br />Duofu Care &amp; Services is a “barrier-free” shuttle service that meets the needs of pregnant women, young children, elderly people and wheelchair users. As well as being a simple shuttle service, it has also developed accessible travel services for clients, arranging packages and customised itineraries so that those with reduced mobility can enjoy outdoor travel.<br /><br />When Mabow Technology saw that many children and grandchildren could not spend time with their elderly relatives because of work commitments, they developed a TV set top box so that elderly people would only need to press the remote control to immediately connect via video with their children and grandchildren. In addition, MABO has launched a “virtual golden grandchildren” service, training selected personnel to video chat with the elderly in order to meet their social and psychological needs.<br /><br />It is less than 10 years until we have a “super-aged society”. Instead of waiting for government help, many social enterprises pulled their sleeves up to help long ago. They use the concepts of Active Ageing, health promotion and more to care for the health of elderly people, as well as to attempt to build a kingdom of entertainment. Who said that the elderly cannot lead a happy, healthy life?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />Background information:<br />As early as 1993, the proportion of elderly people in Taiwan reached 7%, making it an “ageing” society. This rate is expected to reach 14% by 2018, when it will become an “aged” society. By 2025, more than 20% of the population will cross the threshold, making Taiwan a “super-aged” society, where one in every five people will be elderly. <br />1.	Based on the above information, Taiwan has been an “aging society” since 1993, will become an “aged society” next year (2018), and enter into a “super-aged” society by 2025.  Do you think this aging trend will be reversible? If not, what kind of impacts will be facing our country?  <br />2.	As the aging issue is the result of a lower birth rate and a longer life span in Taiwan. What do you think our government should do to deal with this issue? And what should average people do to be well-prepared for the possible population cliff (with negative population growth) after 2025. <br />3.	According to the article, people in Taiwan spend an average of 7 years bedridden, whereas people in Nordic countries just spend an average of 2 weeks bedridden before death. Why the difference is so huge? How can we do to reduce the gap?<br />4.	Retired sports broadcaster Frank Fu (傅達仁), 84, has been campaigning in favor of the legalization of euthanasia in Taiwan for months as he was diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer. What’s your opinion about legalizing euthanasia in Taiwan? And share your opinions on what death mean to you.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Section II:<br />Healthy Mind, Healthy Body: How to Stay Physically and Mentally Fit<br /></span>[url]https://www.thejoint.com/texas/dallas/casa-linda-28074/healthy-mind-healthy-body-how-to-stay-physically-a<br />[/url]Your physical and mental health go hand in hand. When you are able to give a little tender love and care to one aspect of your health, the other is often more able to follow suit. Good physical health leads to good mental health, and vice a versa. In order to stay healthy in all aspects, check out these tips that work for both your physical and mental well-being.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Exercise</span><br />Exercise is great for the body; we all know that. But, it’s also great for the mind. Exercise obviously works the muscles and helps to burn fat. It also increases your range of motion and promotes flexibility. All of these are great reasons to exercise for your physical health. For your mental health, exercise produces endorphins, which are essential for producing good moods. That is why some people get addicted to exercise...because it makes them happy! Exercise is also good for improving your self-image. Just adding this one tip to your daily life can improve your overall health and wellbeing exponentially.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Rest</span><br />On the opposite side of exercise, it’s also imperative that you give your body and mind the time it needs to rest. Rest includes both sleep and relaxation. For your physical health, rest allows the muscles time to recuperate. They are able to build strength on your off days as they heal themselves. For mental health, rest gives your mind a break. You can’t go non-stop without any opportunity to unwind. Rest gives the body and mind a great chance to rebuild, better equipping it to take on the tasks of everyday life.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><br />Make Friends</span><br />Friends are crucial to your well-being. Keep in mind that this does not include friends through social media, but real, live, in the flesh friends. Friends can keep you physically healthy by helping you to stay active, and by also serving as your mirror. Good friends will let you know when your physical health needs a little care. For your mental health, friends provide relief, camaraderie, and they can also help build you up. Spending time with friends is a great way to stay fit physically, mentally, and emotionally.<br /><br />Your health and wellness is important if you want to live a long and happy life. Staying fit in all aspects can help you build a healthy life. Use these tips to keep both your physical and mental health in check so that you can be happy and productive for years to come.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />1.	The author provided 3 simple tips—exercise, rest, and making friends--to stay physically and mentally fit. Do you agree with these tips? <br />2.	Do you have any other tips in addition to the 3 tips mentioned in this article? Share with us?<br />3.	Spending time with friends is a great way to stay fit physically, mentally, and emotionally. What kind of friends do you have? Are they your bff (best friend forever), soulmates, confidants (or confidantes), close friends, fair-weather friends (酒肉朋友), etc.? Do they help you stay fit physically, and mentally?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Agenda</span><br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:05pm discussion session (35 mins)<br />8:05 ~ 8:20pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:20 ~ 8:25pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:25 ~ 8:35pm Taking a 10 minutes break (Intermission)<br />8:35 ~ 9:10pm discussion session (35 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~ 9:30pm Concluding remarks/feedback from newcomers<br />The meeting place of Thursday:<br />摩斯漢堡明曜店 (明曜百貨後面第二條巷子地下室)<br />台北市大安區仁愛路四段151巷37號B1樓<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運 - 板南線 - 忠孝敦化站 (步行約5分鐘)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
