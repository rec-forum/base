Session I:<br />How Do You Deal With Stress? Here’s What I Do<br />Posted on Tuesday - April 14, 2020 by Dr. Jeff McQuillan<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.eslpod.com/eslpod_blog/2020/04/14/how-do-you-deal-with-stress-heres-what-i-do/">https://www.eslpod.com/eslpod_blog/2020 ... what-i-do/</a><!-- m --><br />Many of us are feeling stress right now because of the coronavirus (COVID-19). Stress is feeling worried, nervous, and anxious about something.<br /><br />Aside from the obvious threat of the coronavirus itself, perhaps you’re feeling stressed because your spouse (husband or wife) or children are home with you 24/7 (all the time; 24 hours/7 days a week).<br /><br />Or perhaps you feel cooped up (forced to be inside).<br /><br />Maybe, like me, you’re tired of (no longer want) your own cooking.<br /><br />A lot of people are turning to (deciding to do) exercise to reduce or lower stress.<br /><br />Here in Los Angeles, gyms (fitness centers) are closed and community sports teams aren’t playing. But some people are still going jogging (running slowly and for a long distance), while maintaining (keeping) social distancing (staying away from other people).<br /><br />A lot of people, however, are exercising at home.<br /><br />If you look at popular online stores like Amazon.com, you’ll see that a lot of at-home gym equipment is sold out (there’s no more to sell) or temporarily unavailable.<br /><br />I’m a member of a gym, but it’s closed right now. Instead, I’ve been trying to exercise by using some old gym equipment in a make-shift (temporary and not perfect) gym in my garage.<br /><br />I’ve been trying to do weightlifting (lifting heavy objects to build strength) without the proper dumbbells (a short bar with weights on each end that you hold, one in each hand) and barbells (a long bar with flat, round weights attached to the ends).<br /><br />It’s been only a mild (small) success. But I’m very lucky that I’m healthy enough to even exercise at all.<br /><br />Maybe the best way to relieve (lessen) your stress is to just focus on improving your English?<br /><br />Learn how we talk about stress in English by taking a look at Daily English 319: Being Under Stress .<br /><br />And learn the difference between the terms “stress” and “pressure” in Culture English 239 .<br /><br />Stay healthy!<br /><br />Jeff<br />Q1. Are you feeling stress right now because of the COVID-19? If so why or why not?<br />Q2. How can you cope with the pressures you’re under?<br />Q3. Are you exercising at home? What do you do? <br />Q4.How do you feel when you exercise outside, while maintaining social distance or wearing a mask?<br />Q5. Do you agree that maybe the best way to relieve your stress is to just focus on improving your English? <br /><br />Session II:<br />South Korea Maintains That Rumors of Kim Jong Un's Poor Health Are Untrue<br />By Hyung-jin Kim / AP  April 27, 2020 2:32 PM EDT<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://time.com/5828093/south-korea-kim-jong-un-health/">https://time.com/5828093/south-korea-ki ... un-health/</a><!-- m --><br />(SEOUL, South Korea) — South Korea’s government has dismissed rumors that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is in fragile condition, as speculation about his health intensifies amid the North’s silence on his whereabouts.<br /><br />There are concerns, particularly in Seoul and Washington, about what would happen to North Korea and its nuclear program if anything actually happened to Kim. For South Korea and the U.S., Kim’s absence would mean the departure of a man they’ve dealt with over the past two years to try to achieve North Korea’s denuclearization, though talks have stalled in recent months.<br /><br />Unification Minister Kim Yeon-chul told a closed-door forum in Seoul that South Korea has “enough intelligence to confidently say that there are no unusual developments” in rival North Korea that would back up speculation about Kim’s health, his ministry said Monday.<br /><br />The minister would not reveal at Sunday’s forum what specific intelligence led to that conclusion, but he stressed that it was reached after a thorough analysis.<br /><br />His comments are a reiteration of earlier South Korean statements that Kim Jong Un appeared to be handling state affairs normally and that no unusual activities had been detected in North Korea. Those comments, however, failed to dispel the rumors about Kim, partly because past outside intelligence reports on developments in North Korea have sometimes turned out to be wrong.<br /><br />The rumors about Kim’s health began to swirl after he missed the April 15 commemoration of the 108th birthday of his grandfather, North Korea founder Kim Il Sung. Kim Jong Un is the third generation of his family to rule North Korea, and he hadn’t missed the event, one of the most important in the North, since assuming power after his father, Kim Jong Il, died in late 2011.<br /><br />North Korea’s state media has since made no mention of Kim’s health or his public activities, though they said he had received some messages of greeting from foreign countries. On Monday, North Korea’s state TV said Kim sent his thanks to workers and officials at a tourist resort construction site on the east coast.<br /><br />As the absolute leader of a country with a nuclear weapons program, Kim’s health is a matter of intense interest both regionally and globally. If something were to happen to Kim, it could lead to instability in North Korea.<br /><br />Q1. What is your comment on North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un?<br />Q2. Why is Kim Jong Un’s health a matter of intense interest both regionally and globally?<br />Q3. What do you imagine what the situation of Kim’s health is? <br />Q4. Do you think Kim’s death would be good news or bad news? Why? <br />Q5. If Kim were dead, what would be the impact on the world?<br />Q6. Kim’s Sister Is in the Spotlight. Could a Woman Lead North Korea? Why or Why not?<br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00 ~ 7:30 pm greetings &amp; free talk<br />7:30 ~ 8:15 pm guests introduced &amp; first session discussion<br />8:15 ~ 8:45 pm presentation, sharing the article &amp; other experiences<br />8:45 ~ 9:30 pm second session discussion<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven,<br />板橋民生路二段237 號,<br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30,<br />a minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=89">AndrewWang</a> — Tue Apr 28, 2020 5:04 pm</p><hr />
