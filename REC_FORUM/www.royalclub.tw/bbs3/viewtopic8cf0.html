			<div class="content">Article I : 6 Steps to Help Lower Your Cancer Risk<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.cancer.org/latest-news/6-steps-to-help-lower-your-cancer-risk.html">https://www.cancer.org/latest-news/6-st ... -risk.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Last month, CEO, Kenneth Yen of Yulong group company died from Esophagus Cancer(食道癌), and caused a shock to Taiwan society. Consequentially, cancer issue instantly grips our great attentions. Well, Cancer is often unpredictable, but there are things everyone can do to help reduce their cancer risk or improve their chances of beating the disease if they do get it. What’s more, some of those same behaviors can also help lower your risk for other serious diseases, and boost your odds of living a longer, healthier life.<br /><br />1. Get regular cancer screening tests.<br />Regular screening tests can catch some cancers early, when they’re small, have not spread, and are easier to treat. With cervical and colon cancers, these tests can even prevent cancer from developing in the first place. Talk with your doctor about the tests for breast, cervical, colon, lung, and prostate cancers.<br /><br />2. Get to and stay at a healthy weight.<br />Being overweight or obese is a risk factor for many cancers, including breast, colon, endometrium, kidney, esophagus, and pancreatic cancer. You can control your weightthrough regular exercise and healthy eating.<br /><br />3. Exercise regularly.<br />Physical activity has been shown to lower the risk of several types of cancer, including breast, endometrium, prostate, and colon cancer. It also reduces the risk of other serious diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.<br />	Adults should get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity (equal to a brisk walk) or 75 minutes of vigorous activity (makes your heartbeat and breathing faster, and makes you sweat) each week, preferably spread throughout the week.<br />	Kids should get at least 1 hour of moderate- or vigorous-intensity activity each day, with vigorous activity at least 3 days a week.<br /><br />4. Eat a healthy diet.<br />Studies show that eating a variety of different vegetables and fruits, whole grains, and fish or poultry is linked with a lower risk of developing certain cancers. On the other hand, eating more processed and red meat is linked with a higher risk of developing certain cancers. The American Cancer Society recommends:<br />	Eating at least 2½ cups of vegetables and fruits each day<br />	Eating less red meat (beef, pork, and lamb) and less processed meat (bacon, sausage, luncheon meats, and hot dogs)<br />	Choosing breads, pastas, and cereals made from whole grains instead of refined grains, and brown rice instead of white<br />	Eating fewer sweets<br /><br />5. Avoid tobacco.<br />Tobacco use in the US is responsible for nearly 1 out of every 5 deaths – about 480,000 premature deaths each year. About 80% of lung cancer deaths and 30% of all cancer deaths are caused by tobacco use.   <br />If you don’t use tobacco products, don’t start. If you do, quit. For help, visit cancer.org/quitsmoking, or call the American Cancer Society at 1-800-227-2345.<br /><br />6. Limit alcohol.<br />Research has shown that alcohol can increase your risk for certain kinds of cancer, including breast, mouth, throat, voice box, esophagus, liver, colon and rectal cancer. The more alcohol you drink, the higher your risk.<br />	Men should have no more than 2 drinks a day and women no more than 1.<br />	One drink is equal to about 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1½ ounces of 80-proof liquor.<br /><br />DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:<br />Q1. How common is cancer? And how many people alive today have ever had cancer?<br />Q2. Do you know what the risk factors for cancer are?<br />Q3. Can cancer be prevented and cured?<br />Q5. How could you do in daily life in order to lower cancer risk?<br /><br />===========================================================================================================================<br />Article II : How to Think in English (It’s Easy)<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://engfluent.com/how-to-think-in-english/">https://engfluent.com/how-to-think-in-english/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />If you want to think in English, you need to make English a part of your daily life. That’s all you need to do. If you use English a lot every day, you’ll automatically think in English. It will happen naturally.<br /><br />How do I know this?<br />I know this because I’ve been using English for a long time. And when I think in words, I automatically think in English instead of thinking in my native language. I don’t intentionally try to think in English. It just happens automatically. This is because I’ve made English an important part of my daily life.<br />	I listen to English podcasts and audiobooks almost every day.<br />	I practice speaking English almost every day.<br />	I read something in English quite often.<br />	I’m writing this article in English.<br />If you use English all day every day, you’ll be able to think in English as well.<br /><br />How to Make English a Part of Your Daily Life<br />It’s simple. Choose to do everything in English whenever possible. Here are some examples:<br />	If you want to learn something, read English books &amp; articles about the subject.<br />	If you have hobbies or interests, browse English sites related to those interests.<br />	Change the language of your phone, computer, and TV to English.<br />	Watch Hollywood movies in the original soundtrack (English).<br />Do you get my point?  If something can be done in both English and in your native language, always choose to do it in English.<br /><br />Some people like to do everything in their native language because it’s more comfortable. But if you want to think in English, you have to develop the habit of using English whenever possible. When you make English a part of your life, thinking in English is easy.<br /><br />Improve Your Listening and Speaking Skills (So That You Can Think in English)<br />You should spend some time each day improving your English, especially your listening and speaking skills. These skills are very important (and difficult to improve).<br /><br />People don’t want to use English because their English is terrible. That’s why they rely on their native language so much.<br /><br />If your English is excellent, you will naturally want to use English. And as you use English more and more, you’ll start to think in English.<br /><br />Want to start improving your English? Read these two articles:<br />1. How to improve your listening skills in English (even if you have no time)<br />2. How to learn to speak English (the right way)<br /><br />Translating – The Reason You Can’t Think in English<br />Some English students have the habit of translating between English and their native language when they use English. This usually happens when they write and read in English.<br /><br />If you have this habit, making English a part of your life is NOT enough; you also have to get rid of this bad habit. Here’s how to do that:<br />1. Use English-to-English dictionary<br />Do not use dictionaries that explain word meanings in your native language (bilingual dictionaries). Use English-to-English dictionaries instead. These are dictionaries that explain word meanings in English.<br /><br />When you start using an English-to-English dictionary, you might run into this problem:<br />1.	You look up a word you don’t know (word A).<br />2.	The definition of word A contains another word you don’t know (word B).<br />3.	You have to keep looking for the meanings of new words.<br />The cause of this problem is that the dictionary you’re using is not good; it doesn’t explain difficult words with simpler words. If you run into this problem a lot, just find another dictionary.<br /><br />I once used a dictionary program called WordWeb. It was terrible. Whenever I used it, I often ran into the problem described above. So I switched to another dictionary, and I’ve never had the problem since then. (Today, I use the Oxford Dictionaries website to look up words I don’t know.)<br /><br />Another benefit of using English-to-English dictionaries is that it improves your English reading skills. When you read word definitions in English, you’re practicing your reading skills in English.<br /><br />2. Force yourself to write in English without translating<br />When some students want to write something in English, they write it in their native language first, then they translate what they wrote to English.<br />They tend to do this when they have to write a long email, passage, or article in English.<br />This is not a proper way to write in English. If you do this often, you must stop. If you have to write something in English, force yourself to just write in English from the start.<br /><br />Summary<br />Here’s how you can think in English:<br />1.	Choose to do everything in English whenever possible.<br />2.	Spend some time every day improving your English (focus on your listening and speaking skills).<br />3.	Stop translating between English and your native language.<br /><br />We don’t think in language very much (we usually think in abstract concepts). But if you follow these suggestions, you might find that, sometimes, you think in the English language.<br /><br />DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:<br />Q1. Why do we need to think in English?<br />Q2. Can Thinking in English help you improve your English skills?<br />Q3. Can Thinking in English help you think more clearly?<br />Q4. What are simple steps for Thinking in English?</div>
