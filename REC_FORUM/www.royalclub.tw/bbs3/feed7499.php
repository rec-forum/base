5/23(Sat.)Topic one : The science of habits on TEDx/12 tips to help you lose weight(Martin)<br /><br />Article:Topic one : The science of habits on TEDx<br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSZyzhi8C9o" class="postlink">The Science of Habits | Marco Badwal | TEDxFS</a><br /><br />Question<br />1.What bad habits do you have?<br />2.What good habits do you have?<br />3.What good habits you want<br /> to cultivate? How to cultivate it and what do you need to do every day.<br /><br />Article two : 12 tips to help you lose weight<br /><br /><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/12-tips-to-help-you-lose-weight/" class="postlink">LINK</a><br /><br />Get off to the best possible start on the NHS weight loss plan with these 12 diet and exercise tips.<br /> <br />1. Do not skip breakfast<br />Skipping breakfast will not help you lose weight. You could miss out on essential nutrients and you may end up snacking more throughout the day because you feel hungry.<br /> <br />Check out healthy breakfast recipes<br /> <br />2. Eat regular meals<br />Eating at regular times during the day helps burn calories at a faster rate. It also reduces the temptation to snack on foods high in fat and sugar.<br /> <br />Find out more about eating healthily<br /> <br />3. Eat plenty of fruit and veg<br />Fruit and veg are low in calories and fat, and high in fibre – 3 essential ingredients for successful weight loss. They also contain plenty of vitamins and minerals.<br /> <br /> <br />4. Get more active<br />Being active is key to losing weight and keeping it off. As well as providing lots of health benefits, exercise can help burn off the excess calories you cannot lose through diet alone.<br /> <br />Find an activity you enjoy and are able to fit into your routine.<br /> <br />5. Drink plenty of water<br />People sometimes confuse thirst with hunger. You can end up consuming extra calories when a glass of water is really what you need.<br /> <br />Read more about drinking water as part of a healthy diet<br /> <br />6. Eat high fibre foods<br />Foods containing lots of fibre can help keep you feeling full, which is perfect for losing weight. Fibre is only found in food from plants, such as fruit and veg, oats, wholegrain bread, brown rice and pasta, and beans, peas and lentils.<br /> <br />7. Read food labels<br />Knowing how to read food labels can help you choose healthier options. Use the calorie information to work out how a particular food fits into your daily calorie allowance on the weight loss plan.<br /> <br />Find out more about reading food labels<br /> <br />8. Use a smaller plate<br />Using smaller plates can help you eat smaller portions. By using smaller plates and bowls, you may be able to gradually get used to eating smaller portions without going hungry. It takes about 20 minutes for the stomach to tell the brain it's full, so eat slowly and stop eating before you feel full.<br /> <br />9. Do not ban foods<br />Do not ban any foods from your weight loss plan, especially the ones you like. Banning foods will only make you crave them more. There's no reason you cannot enjoy the occasional treat as long as you stay within your daily calorie allowance.<br /> <br />10. Do not stock junk food<br />To avoid temptation, do not stock junk food – such as chocolate, biscuits, crisps and sweet fizzy drinks – at home. Instead, opt for healthy snacks, such as fruit, unsalted rice cakes, oat cakes, unsalted or unsweetened popcorn, and fruit juice.<br /> <br />11. Cut down on alcohol<br />A standard glass of wine can contain as many calories as a piece of chocolate. Over time, drinking too much can easily contribute to weight gain.<br /> <br />Find out more about the calories in alcohol<br /> <br />12. Plan your meals<br />Try to plan your breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks for the week, making sure you stick to your calorie allowance. You may find it helpful to make a weekly shopping list.<br /> <br />Question:<br />1: do you like or hate the diet program? Have you every failed your diet program?<br />2.What is the difficult tips for you on the tips'?<br />3.What kind of scenario you like to eat and enjoy food. <br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00 ~ 7:30 pm greetings &amp; free talk<br />7:30 ~ 8:15 pm guests introduced &amp; first session discussion<br />8:15 ~ 8:45 pm presentation, sharing the article &amp; other experiences<br />8:45 ~ 9:30 pm second session discussion<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven,<br />板橋民生路二段237 號,<br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30,<br />a minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12531">Danny Lin</a> — Tue May 19, 2020 10:01 am</p><hr />
