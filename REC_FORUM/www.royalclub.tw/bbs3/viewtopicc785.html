In the U.S., showing a photo of that card on your phone will usually suffice.<br /><br />Denmark, Greece, France, Italy, some Canadian provinces and the U.S. cities of New Orleans, New York and San Francisco are among the places that have vaccination requirements to get into places like indoor restaurants or theaters. Enforcement varies and many places also accept a recent negative test for the virus, a partial vaccination or proof that you previously recovered from the disease.<br /><br />Even without government mandates, more businesses in countries where vaccines are readily available are starting to ask for proof that you got the shots, so long as their local governments haven’t blocked them from doing so.<br />Officials around the world were initially reluctant to mandate vaccines, but some now hope doing so will persuade more people to get the shots. Businesses requiring proof of vaccination say they are trying to make customers and employees feel safe.<br /><br />Protesters in France and elsewhere have criticized vaccine mandates as invasive and restricting freedom of movement. Privacy advocates have raised concerns about getting people in the habit of having their phones scanned wherever they go, and generally favor options that won’t be tracked, such as a paper record or a digital copy in your phone that can be shown at the door.<br />Questions:<br /><br />1.Do you think vaccine passport is feasible in Taiwan?<br />2.Do you think the policy of vaccine passport is invasive and restricts freedom of movement?<br />3.Do you have any privacy concerns about vaccine passport?<br />4.If our government doesn’t implement vaccine passport, and which is required by other countries for entering their border, how can we do?<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="font-weight: bold">Session 2:</span></span> The Quintuple Stimulus Voucher Program<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2021/09/10/2003764119">https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/ ... 2003764119</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Questions:<br />1.	Is it a good program that we don’t need to pay $1,000 to exchange $5,000 vouchers?<br />2.	Do you think $5,000 vouchers per person is enough, or just better than nothing?<br />3.	What method do you want to receive your vouchers?<br />4.	Where will you use your vouchers?<br />5.	Do you think the program will really add NT200 billion to our economy?</div>
