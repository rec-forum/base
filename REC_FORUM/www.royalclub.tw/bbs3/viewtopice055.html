			<div class="content">Session l. How to live your best life in retirement<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://reurl.cc/e5dv2m">https://reurl.cc/e5dv2m</a><!-- m --><br /><br />No more 9 to 5 means a whole new approach to life. Here's how to embrace retirement with healthy habits that can make your golden years quality years.<br />By Mayo Clinic Staff<br />When you first launched into your working life, you may have dreamed of the day you could hang up your employee ID badge and turn off your alarm clock and cellphone. <br />But for many workers, when it actually happens, the transition to retirement can feel daunting. That dream you had at age 25 of sipping pina coladas on the beach may feel more like &quot;What now?&quot; at 65.<br /><br />Like any major life transition, retirement is a time of shifting priorities. And how you spend all that newfound free time can make a big difference in your health and quality of life. Here's how to make the most of your post-working years.<br />Picture the life you want<br />Close your eyes and imagine your happiest and most fulfilling version of retirement. What do you hope to be doing on a random Tuesday? Do you picture yourself spending time with grandchildren? Trying new recipes and hosting dinners? Volunteering at a hospital or mentoring co-workers at your old job? Playing golf with your friends? <br /><br />Taking the time to think about what brings you meaning and purpose gives you a clearer vision of where you will find a good quality of life — and some helpful road markers to know if you are getting closer or further away.<br />Find a routine<br />Sure, freedom and flexibility sound great. But for many people, too much flexibility can start to be more stressful than pleasant. Most people have healthier lives with routines and patterns. <br />That doesn't have to mean packing your schedule. Simply slot in a few regular activities that fit with how you want to spend your time. It could be weekly walks with a neighbor, or picking up your grandchild from school every Tuesday.<br /><br />And that dream about a life without an alarm clock? Go for it, but keep some boundaries on your sleep habits. Sleep is the foundation for a resilient life, and getting up at the same time each day (within an hour) is a healthy routine to keep — even without a job to report to every day.<br />Stay socially connected<br />Loneliness can be a part of aging. But it doesn't have to be. If work has been your primary social outlet, moving away from that world can feel like a shock. Think about what social connections you want to maintain, and what new ones you want to build on — ideally before you retire. <br />Sign up to volunteer in your community, invite your neighbor over for a BBQ and reinvest in your relationship with your spouse or other close friends. Faith based communities can also be a source of social connection.<br />Keep on learning<br />Research shows that challenging the brain in new ways can help to keep you mentally sharp. While you're working, that often comes with the territory: meeting new people, mastering new skills. But when you retire, you may have to be more proactive. <br />You can — and should — keep discovering new things in your retired life, too. But you may have to seek them out. There are plenty of ways to do it, and crossword puzzles and sudoku are only the beginning.<br />Travel, whether it's to a nearby city for a day or a far-flung destination for a month. Walk in nature. Take an adult education course at a community college. Whatever you choose, be sure to also get offline: More screen time has been linked with worse mental health in retirement, while more physical activity has the opposite effect.<br />So with some planning and challenging ourselves, retirement can be an enjoyable phase in our lives. <br />Q1. If you retire, how do you spend your time and what are you most want to do? Why?<br />Q2. “Stay socially connected” is a great idea for retired person, What kind of social groups        <br />        do you want join? Why?<br />Q3. After you retire, do you consider living with your children and take care of <br />        grandchildren? Why or Why not?<br />Q4. When your pension is not enough to pay for retirement, do you consider selling a<br />         house or leave it to your children? Why?<br />   Session ll .  National Park<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://reurl.cc/1QGjap">https://reurl.cc/1QGjap</a><!-- m --><br />Yangmingshan National Park is located in northern Taipei City, and easily accessible from downtown. Spanning 114SQ. KM the area is home to numerous parks, hiking trails, interesting plants and wildlife, and the internationally famous hot springs.<br />Designated as Category II by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as a national park for protection of nature and wildlife and ranging in elevation from 200 metres to 1,200 metres, there are many different subtropical and warm temperate climate zones that can be found within the park.<br /><br />The lasting Japanese influence on the area can be found in the area’s countless hot springs around Beitou and Xingyi Road, as well as many private hot springs only available by reservation. The Japanese also planted black pines, acacia trees, and the Formosan sweet gum to beautify the mountain. To this day, the area is very popular with Japanese tourists.<br />As the area is rich in sulphur, mining operations previously operated in the area. All mining operations have been shut down due to environmental effects, and visitors can check out the decommissioned mines such as the one at Liuhuanggu (硫磺谷).<br />With its growth as a centre for sulphur mining in northern Taiwan, many Han Chinese such as the Hoklo from Fujian and the Hakka began moving to the area to cultivate tea plantations and other agricultural products, and today, wide-scale agriculture has been replaced by more boutique-style agriculture with a tourism focus, such as the Calla lilies at Zhuzihu (竹子湖).<br />Each season brings a different type of beauty to the area. February and March are the flowering season, and rhododendrons and cherry blossoms cover the mountain slopes to welcome the spring. Summer brings winds from the southwest with occasional showers and thunder in the afternoon, creating amazing weather effects in the mountains. By October, the mountains are covered with silver grass and the golden red colour of maple leaves. Rainbows can be seen after misty autumn rains. Winter time has unique scenery as well since monsoons bring a cold drizzle that create seas of clouds that look like a fantasy world, with the possibility of snow falling on cold days.<br />Different tour options are available to Yangmingshan, including a day trip with hot springs.<br />Q1. Do you know what is the advantages of having national parks? <br />Q2. Have you ever visited some famous national parks in Taiwan or other countries?                                                   <br />      What are their  characteristics?  What is unforgettable and worth sharing? Please     <br />       share it with us?<br />Q3. Yangmingshan National Park is the back garden of Taipei people , usually what do              <br /> you do there? Do you think it is worth visiting again and again? Why?<br /> Suggested Agenda<br />7:00 p.m. --7:30 p.m. Free talk<br />7:30 p.m. --8:10 p.m. First topic discussion<br />8:10 p.m. --8:40 p.m. Presentation (At least two members of each table are invited)<br />8:40 p.m.-- 9.:15 p.m. Second topic discussion<br />9:15 p.m.-- 9:30 p.m. Presentation (Participants that haven't presented yet are invited)<br /><br />speaker time: 2 minutes for each speaker<br />host time: 3 minutes<br /><br />The meeting place of Thursday:<br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第三區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
