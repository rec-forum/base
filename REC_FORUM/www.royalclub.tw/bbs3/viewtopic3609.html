This is selfishness and the belief you are better than you are. You think you are better than everyone else. Researchers found that people who used social media sites a lot showed a 25 percent rise in narcissism in just four months. The researchers studied people aged 18 to 34 and how their personality changed. Posting selfies seemed to increase levels of narcissism; sending text messages didn't.<br />A researcher said there were links between narcissism and the use of selfies. He said there wasn't much research on this topic. The results of his study suggest that posting selfies can increase narcissism. He said that &quot;about 20 percent of people may be at risk of developing&quot; narcissism. They want attention and likes from other people after they post a selfie. They want to show others how their life is better.<br /> <br />Discussion<br /><br />1.What do you think of selfies?
