This is a fairly wet mixture and the beating is important.<br />Beat through enough to make a smooth batter but not too much that the air is taken out.<br /><br />4.Pour into grease and base lined (baking paper on the bottom) cake tin.<br /><br />5.Bake for approximately 40 minutes at 325°F (160°C) or until cooked when tested. Test by inserting a clean metal skewer into the centre of the cake and when the skewer is pulled out, it should be clean. If there is a sign of batter on the skewer, the cake is not fully cooked.<br />If the cake is still wet and/or moist when tested place back in the oven for another 5-10 minutes.<br /><br />6.Add frosting, sprinkles, and any other sorts of decoration.<br /><br />for more detail, please click on the link<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Simple-Chocolate-Cake">https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Simple-Chocolate-Cake</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br /><br />Discussion:<br />1. Do you like chocolate cakes?<br />2. Is it healthy to often have a cake? <br />3. Do you have any story about a cake?<br />4. After watching the tutoring article, do you feel like giving it a try? It will save money for your family.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Session 2: 7 Tiny Steps for the Beginner Minimalist<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://bemorewithless.com/begin/">https://bemorewithless.com/begin/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />1. Write it down. Make a list of all the reasons you want to live more simply. If you are sick of debt collectors, write it down. Mad that you never get any time with your kids? Write it down. To stressed out to sleep at night? Put it on paper. Want to fire your boss? Yep, write that down too. These are your whys and your whys will provide great leverage when you think it’s too hard to keep going. Your whys will help you remember what matters.<br /><br />2. Discard the duplicates. Walk through your home with a box and fill it with duplicates. If you have two sets of measuring cups, put them in the box. Copies of the same book or DVD? Put one in the box. Doubles on place mat sets? You only need one. Once you fill the box, label it “Duplicates” and put it out of sight for 30 days. If you don’t need anything or don’t remember what was in the box, donate it.<br /><br />3. Declare a clutter-free zone. This area could be a kitchen table, your nightstand, a countertop or a drawer in your kitchen. Use that clutter-free zone as inspiration to live with less. If you enjoy that clean, clear environment, expand the zone a little bit each day. A clutter-free countertop can become a clutter-free room and a clutter free room can become the clutter-free, minimalist home you’ve been thinking about.<br /><br />4. Travel lightly. Travel always renews my love of minimalism and living simply. The next time you take a trip, pack for 1/2 the time. If you are traveling for 4 days, pack for 2. You can wash and hang clothes if you need to or wear the same things twice. See how it feels to carry less baggage.<br /><br />5. Dress with Less. If you haven’t considered Project 333, dressing with only 33 items for 3 months (clothes, shoes, jewelry, accessories) sounds extreme, but thousands of people know that it actually makes life easier instead of more challenging.<br /><br />6. Eat similar meals. When you think about how much time you spend thinking about what you are going to eat for lunch, make your family for dinner, or what you need to pick up at the grocery store, it’s clear that food is not always simple. Try eating the same breakfast and lunch all week and have 2 or 3 dinner choices that rotate throughout the week. If your family complains, let them know it’s an experiment and then talk about it at the end of the week.<br /><br />7. Save $1000. An emergency fund simplifies everything. If you are paying off debt, only pay your minimum payments until you can save $1000. If you aren’t in debt, but still spend what you have, set aside money every day or every week until you reach $1000. Try the 52 week money challenge and in 45 weeks, you’ll save more than $1000 without ever contributing more than $45 in a week. Money for emergencies reduces stress and emergencies.<br /><br />Try these one at a time and continue to take tiny steps and lean into the life you crave. Even if it takes 10 years to get to where you think you want to be, the benefits begin immediately.<br /><br />The beauty of being a beginner minimalist is that you can be curious, and daring. You can ask for help, get back up if you fall, and look forward to new adventures in a life with less stuff, drama, debt, and obligation.<br /><br /><br />Discussion:<br />1. What is a minimalist?<br />2. What is the advantage to become a minimalist?<br />3. Do you think you are always lacking enough space at home? <br />4. Share some stories about your duplicates at home? Does it bother you? <br />P.S.<br />1.因疫情關係，聚會方式改為線上遠距。<br />2.參加三次後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />3.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=89">AndrewWang</a> — Tue Sep 07, 2021 9:30 pm</p><hr />
