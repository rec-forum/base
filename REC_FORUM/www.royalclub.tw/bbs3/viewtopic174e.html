			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Session I: How to delay dementia and reduce your risk</span><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://qbi.uq.edu.au/dementia/how-delay-dementia-and-reduce-your-risk">https://qbi.uq.edu.au/dementia/how-dela ... -your-risk</a><!-- m --><br /><br />While scientists are working hard on developing treatments for dementia, there is still no cure. Medications can treat some effects of underlying disease, while other therapies help manage the symptoms.<br /> <br />Taking action in the following five areas may help reduce the risk of developing dementia, and delay its onset. For more, see yourbrainmatters.org.au.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Look after you heart</span><br /><br />Keeping blood pressure, cholesterol, Type II diabetes and obesity under control can reduce the impact of vascular dementia in particular. Quitting smoking also falls into this category, and it reduces neurotoxins that could further damage neurons.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Be physically active</span><br /><br />Exercise is thought to stimulate the brain to produce new neurons and thereby reduce cognitive decline. Muscle-strengthening activities also help with balance (reducing falls). As well as improving mood, exercise also helps protect your heart by reducing the associated risk factors. See more about QBI's exercise and cognition study.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Enjoy social activity</span><br /><br />Social engagement increases mental activity and emotional connections to others and can help strengthen the pathways of memories. Social isolation not only increases the risk of dementia, but also increases the risk of hypertension, depression and coronary heart disease, which are also risk factors for dementia.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Follow a healthy diet</span><br /><br />Studies have shown that following a healthy diet – eating lots of fruit, vegetables, legumes and nuts; replacing butter with olive oil; eating fish twice a week; adding herbs and spices instead of salt; and limiting red meat – is associated with a reduction in the risk of dementia. Processed foods with high fats and trans fats are associated with an increased risk of dementia.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Mentally challenge your brain</span><br /><br />Use it or lose it is the key concept here. Challenging your brain with new activities can help build new brain cells and strengthen connections. These may not have impacts on memory, but there is some evidence it aids executive functions, such as decision-making and reasoning, and helps to process things faster.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />1.

People who were bilingual or multilingual developed dementia an average of 4.5 years later than those who spoke only one language,    researchers wrote in the journal Neurology.

In the absence of any signal from them, should we try to make our presence known?<br /><br />One of those asking these questions is Stephen Hawking, the British cosmologist with many deep thoughts and a good sense of humour.<br /><br />Unlike many celebrity scientists, Hawking's provocative, news-grabbing statements almost always have some content worth pondering.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Looking for ET</span><br /><br />Hawking is part of a Breakthrough Listen project to develop more sensitive radio receivers and listen in on the alien civilisations of the cosmos.<br /><br />There is another project called Breakthrough Message to design a digital message that could be transmitted from Earth to an extraterrestrial civilisation. The message should be &quot;representative of humanity and planet Earth&quot;.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The program pledges:</span><br /><br />... not to transmit any message until there has been a global debate at high levels of science and politics on the risks and rewards of contacting advanced civilisations.<br /><br />But Hawking wants us to listen, and not to talk — use our ears, not our mouth. He wants us to eavesdrop but not join the conversation. He wants us to keep our head low.<br /><br />That sounds like a reasonable idea. Better safe than sorry. But in the spectrum between, paranoia and unjustifiable fear on one side, and reasonable caution on the other, where does keeping your head low fit in?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What kind of ET could we find?</span><br /><br />Hawking's comments are motivated by a fear of what the aliens would do to us if they find us. In his mind, the aliens are the Spanish Conquistador Cortez and we are the Aztecs he made contact with in central America.<br /><br />Tribal warfare, genocide and ethnic cleansing have been part of our history for thousands of years. Hawking's fear is a fear of what we have done to ourselves.<br /><br />Would advanced alien civilisations be as barbaric as we are? Are our genocidal tendencies at all representative of advanced alien civilisations? Maybe.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Cyanobacteria</span><br /><br />PHOTO: Under the microscope: cyanobacteria. (Commons: Matthewjparker)<br />Hawking says he worries that any aliens &quot;will be vastly more powerful and may not see us as any more valuable than we see bacteria&quot;.<br /><br />But Stephen, bacteria ARE valuable. Our bacterial biomes keep us alive and healthy. They have been here for about 4 billion years. They invented the ability to harvest sunlight for energy. They produced the oxygen we breathe, and as mitochondria, they do our breathing.<br /><br />Life on Earth would do fine without people, but without bacteria no other life forms would exist. So Hawking is over-estimating our importance and under-estimating our insignificance to aliens.<br /><br />We will be much less valuable to aliens, than bacteria are to us.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Advanced civilization</span><br /><br />The age distribution of Earth-like planets in the universe tells us that the average Earth-like planet is about 2 billion years older than our Earth.<br /><br />If life has formed on these other Earths, it has had, on average, 2 billion years longer to evolve than we have had. This is the fact that has Hawking worried.<br /><br />If you imagine that the pace of biological and technological evolution on these other Earths is about the same as it has been on our Earth, then alien civilisations are on average two billion years more advanced than we are.<br /><br />To put that time frame into perspective, two billion years ago, our ancestors on Earth were amoebas or parameciums — single-celled eukaryotes of some kind.<br /><br />I agree with Hawking that we should keep our heads low. But we have already opened our mouths and started coughing — betraying our existence to any big-eared aliens.<br /><br />Via television broadcasts we have already sent the 1936 Berlin Olympics and the I Love Lucy show to the stars.<br /><br />Currently our strongest emissions into the cosmos — emissions that are making our presence known to the aliens — are the emissions that we think are protecting us from terrestrial aliens.<br /><br />Those emissions are military radar. The unintended consequence of this protective radar is that it is simultaneously shouting out to the aliens &quot;here we are&quot;.<br /><br />So the biggest threat to humanity is humanity — our nuclear weapons, our guns, our big brains and our powerful radar systems.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Contact or not?</span><br /><br />While discussing the value of searching for extraterrestrial intelligence SETI, a colleague told me that it was dangerous to even listen to aliens. He thought the message would be like a Trojan horse.<br />If we let the message into our minds, it would kill us.<br /><br />It would be like sticking a virus-contaminated USB stick into your computer. The militaristic generals in the movie Contact should come to mind here: &quot;Ellie Arroway! Don't build that machine!&quot;<br /><br />Science fiction writer Arthur C Clarke once said that any sufficiently advanced technology would be indistinguishable from magic. But futurist Karl Schroeder thinks that any sufficiently advanced technology will be indistinguishable from nature.<br /><br />I don't know. Maybe Schroeder's right and advanced aliens have made their peace with the universe. But even if there aren't any advanced alien civilisations elsewhere in the universe, keeping your head down is probably a good exercise in humility.<br /><br />Charley Lineweaver is a researcher at the School of Astronomy and Astrophysics and the Research School of Earth Sciences at Australian National University.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />1.	&quot;If aliens ever visit us, I think the outcome would be much as when Christopher Columbus first landed in America, which didn't turn out very well for the Native Americans, &quot;Hawking said in 2010 during an episode of the Discovery Channel's &quot;Into the Universe with Stephen Hawking.&quot; What do you think about his warning?<br /><br />2.	A Yushan National Park policeman pictured a transparent ET-looking object near Jiaming Lake. Do you believe there's an extraterrestrial being living there?<br /><br />3.	What if the ET whom we run into has good will towards humans, what projects are supposed to cooperate with him/ her? When they leave the Earth, what object is the best souvenir for the alien guests?<br /><br />4.	What if the ET has ambition to conquer us and declare war against human beings, what will we do?<br />Ans: 1) Raise the white flag. 2) Peace talk. 3) Fight to see. 4) Strike first. 5) Your answer.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Agenda:</span><br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />8:10 ~ 8:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:25 ~ 8:30pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:30 ~9:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~9:30pm Concluding remarks/feedback from newcomers<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The meeting place of Thursday:</span><br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第一區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
