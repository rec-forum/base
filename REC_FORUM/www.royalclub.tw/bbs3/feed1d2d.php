I smile at him. I even winked at him, TWO TIMES! <br />You winked him? <br />And all I get back is one, ONE FINE FAKE SMILE! <br />How did you wink at him? <br />Like that! <br />You didn't! <br />And all I get back is one fake smile! <br />I've tried! I've tried! Why is my life so miserable? <br />Show me how you winked at him. <br />I just did. <br />Show me. <br />And what did he do back? <br />That's it? <br />THAT'S IT! <br />THAT'S ALL! <br />I get nothing else...but... <br />THAT'S ALL I GET! <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />1.What's your feelings and opinions about this video---Little girls first flirtation fail <br />2.People mostly agree that the video were taken under real scenario instead of a performance under arrangement.

The ones that have figured out how to convey their value proposition to their buyer persona in just one, short sentence -- and a quippy one, at that.<br /><br />So if you're looking to get a little slogan inspiration of your own, take a look at some of our favorite company slogans and taglines from both past and present. But before we get into specific examples, let's quickly go over what a slogan is, how it differs from a tagline, and what makes these branded one-liners stand out.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What Is a Slogan?</span><br /><br />In business, a slogan is &quot;a catchphrase or small group of words that are combined in a special way to identify a product or company,&quot; according to Entrepreneur.com's small business encyclopedia.<br /><br />In many ways, they're like mini-mission statements.<br /><br />Companies have slogans for the same reason they have logos: advertising. While logos are visual representations of a brand, slogans are audible representations of a brand. Both formats grab consumers' attention more readily than the name a company or product might. Plus, they're simpler to understand and remember.<br /><br />The goal? To leave a key brand message in consumers' minds so that, if they remember nothing else from an advertisement, they'll remember the slogan.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">What Makes a Great Slogan?</span><br /><br />According to HowStuffWorks, a great slogan has most or all of the following characteristics:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">It's memorable.</span><br /><br />Is the slogan quickly recognizable? Will people only have to spend a second or two thinking about it? A brief but strong few words can go a long way in advertisements, videos, posters, business cards, swag, and other places.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">It includes a key benefit.</span><br /><br />Ever heard the marketing advice, &quot;Sell the sizzle, not the steak&quot;? It means sell the benefits, not the features -- which applies perfectly to slogans. A great slogan makes a company or product's benefits clear to the audience.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">It differentiates the brand.</span><br /><br />Does your light beer have the fullest flavor? Or maybe the fewest calories? What is it about your product or brand that sets it apart from competitors? (Check out our essential branding guide here.)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">It imparts positive feelings about the brand.</span><br /><br />The best taglines use words that are positive and upbeat. For example, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups' slogan, &quot;Two great tastes that taste great together,&quot; gives the audience good feelings about Reese's, whereas a slogan like Lea &amp; Perrins', &quot;Steak sauce only a cow could hate,&quot; uses negative words. The former leaves a better impression on the audience.<br />Now that we've covered what a slogan is and what makes one great, here are examples of some of the best brand slogans of all time. (Note: We've updated this post with several ideas folks previously shared with us in the comments.)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Slogan vs. Tagline</span><br /><br />Although both &quot;slogan&quot; and &quot;tagline&quot; tend to be used interchangeably, they actually serve two different purposes. <br />As we mentioned in Entrepreneur.com's definition above, a slogan identifies a product or company. So does a tagline, for that matter. Where these terms differ is in how they position a company in its industry.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">A slogan</span> encompasses a company's mission, what it stands for, and even how it's helping customers in the individual campaigns the company might run. Slogans can therefore be longer than taglines, as you'll see in the list below.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">A tagline</span> is a catchy quip that evokes an image of your brand in the minds of your customers. Taglines enable people to make lighthearted associations with your business: &quot;When I see [tagline], I think [company].&quot;<br /><br />Taglines are more often next to the company's logo on official advertisements, and are dedicated more specifically to brand awareness than slogans. Slogans carry a brand's values and promises as the company grows and evolves, and can be promoted under an overarching company tagline.<br /><br />Your organization doesn't have to develop both a slogan and a tagline -- it might succeed with just a solid, recognizable tagline. But as you develop new products and identify new types of customers, you might find your brand launching a campaign that is primed for its own slogan.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Catchy Business Slogans and Taglines</span><br />1.
