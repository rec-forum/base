<span style="font-weight: bold">Session I: Inemuri culture</span><br /><a href="https://www.amusingplanet.com/2018/09/inemuri-japanese-art-of-sleeping-at-work.html" class="postlink">https://www.amusingplanet.com/2018/09/inemuri-japanese-art-of-sleeping-at-work.html</a><br /><br />In most countries sleeping at work is not only embarrassing, it might even cost one’s job. But in Japan, sleeping in the office is common and is socially accepted. In fact, it is often seen as a sign of diligence, as in—”the person is so dedicated to their job that they worked themselves to exhaustion.”<br /><br />And it is not untrue. Japan is one of the most sleep-deprived nation in the world. One study suggests that an average Japanese sleep only 6 hours and 35 minutes each night. Hence most fall asleep during commute or at work, in parks, in coffee shops, in bookstores, in shopping malls, and in any other public place. It is so widespread and so normal, that the Japanese have a word for it—inemuri, which means “present while sleeping.”<br />Nobody knows inemuri better than Dr. Brigitte Steger, a scholar at the University of Cambridge, who studies Japanese culture.<br /><br />“I first encountered these intriguing attitudes to sleep during my first stay in Japan in the late 1980s,” she wrote in an article on BBC. “At that time Japan was at the peak of what became known as the Bubble Economy, a phase of extraordinary speculative boom. Daily life was correspondingly hectic. People filled their schedules with work and leisure appointments, and had hardly any time to sleep.”<br /><br />It was during this period of postwar economic boom that the nation gained the reputation of a hardworking nation with no time to sleep. People worked long hours and then napped during the notoriously long commute back home. Students stayed up late cramming and then dozed off during classes next morning. It seems contradictory, but the tolerance for falling asleep during meetings, classes, and social gatherings is widespread in Japanese culture.<br /><br />But there are rules to inemuri. “It depends who you are,” says Steger. “If you are new in the company and have to show how actively you are involved, you cannot sleep. But if you are 40 or 50 years old and it is not directly your main topic, you can sleep. The higher up the social ladder you are, the more you can sleep.”<br /><br />Another clue to deciphering the complicated etiquettes of inemuri lies in the term itself—to be present while sleeping. “Even though the sleeper might be mentally ‘away’, they have to be able to return to the social situation at hand when active contribution is required,” Steger says. “Your body needs to pretend that you are active in a meeting, like you are concentrating. You cannot sleep under the table or anything. You have to sit as if you are listening intently, and just put your head down.”<br /><br />There are a few close cousins to the inemuri culture that can be found in other countries too, such as the Spanish siesta (a short nap taken in the early afternoon, often after the midday meal), and the Italian riposo (an extended lunch break that lasts for 2-3 hours allowing people to nap).<br /><br />In recent years, the practice of napping at work has received support from a number of employers across the world. Notable among them is Google, Apple, Nike, BASF, Opel, the Huffington Post and Proctor &amp; Gamble, who provide dedicated napping rooms and sleeping pods for employees to take short naps during office hours.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion Questions:</span><br />Q1. Can you stand / appreciate such culture happened in Taiwan? Why or why not?<br />Q2. When you feel exhausted, what is your best resolution?<br />Q3. How many minutes did you take a nap? After that nap, how do you feel?<br />     <a href="https://www.sleep.org/articles/how-long-to-nap/" class="postlink">https://www.sleep.org/articles/how-long-to-nap/</a><br />Q4. Now it's a rehearsal to warm up the next session.<br />     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni3ifIaWmGc" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni3ifIaWmGc</a><br />     <span style="font-weight: bold">Rules for Q4: </span><br />     1. Don't just play pantomime.  <br />     2. Add your own English lines to the scenario. <br />     3. Time limitation is 90 seconds. <br />     4. Don't touch or really slap your partner, use your fake move to match your partner's tacit understanding to play slap on forehead.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Session II: Role Play</span><br /><br />Choose whichever clip you like to play but your role is cast by discussion and compromise in your team. We don't use props, sound effects, stage setting and costumes, but we try pantomime style with sound to amend the weaknesses. There's no director, video camera and professional actor/actress with superb acting inside the play. We're all ordinary or clumsy people. So, don't worry. Have fun.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Agenda in session 2 is modified to:</span><br />8:30 ~9:10pm discussion and rehearsal (40 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:30pm group1 action (5mins)/ discuss (? mins)// group 2 action (5 mins)/discuss (? mins)// group 3 action (5mins)/discuss (? mins)...........<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion Questions:</span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">1.Welcome to Jurassic Park Scene (5 persons)</span><br />      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJlmYh27MHg" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJlmYh27MHg</a><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">2.Chaos Theory Scene (4 persons)</span><br />       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-mpifTiPV4" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-mpifTiPV4</a><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">3.00:00 - 01:09 The Intern (2 persons)</span><br />       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L09Z538KEvw" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L09Z538KEvw</a><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">SCRIPT</span><br />So you're on Facebook, huh?<br />Well, I've been trying to figure it out.<br />I joined about 10 minutes ago.<br />Well, better late than never.<br />Do you want some help?<br />I'd love some, but, really, you've got better things to do.<br />No. I need a diversion.<br />You have a photo of yourself?<br />No. I need one?<br />Uh, if you wanna look up all those hotties from high school, you do.<br />Say cheese.<br />-Cheese.<br />That is cute.<br />Okay, I just need to send that to you.<br />Uh...<br />All right, so there are all these questions for your profile that you can answer if you want to or not.<br />Like religious views, political views, people who inspire you.<br />Jules Ostin<br />I'm not trying to brown-nose you, but I've been in business a long time and I've never run across anyone quite like you.<br />You do inspire, Jules.<br />I just knew, at the end of the day, that a woman with a glass of wine and a laptop had real shopping potential.<br />-You have a favorite quote?<br />-I do.<br />&quot;You're never wrong to do the right thing.&quot;<br />-Who said that, you?<br />-Yeah.<br />But I'm pretty sure Mark Twain said it first.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">4.Back in Business Scene (5 persons)</span><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PscRUlsvhtI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PscRUlsvhtI</a><!-- m -->  <br />Okay.<br />Good.
