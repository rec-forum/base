			<div class="content">7/13(Sat.) Japan plans new driver's license system for elderly as accidents surge/Angry crowd runs amok in Taichung<br />(Host:Shuman)<br /><br />Japan plans new driver's license system for elderly as accidents surge<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/06/11/national/japan-plans-new-drivers-license-system-elderly-accidents-surge/#.XRiY2-gzbIU">https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/ ... RiY2-gzbIU</a><!-- m --> <br /><br />In the wake of a slew of fatal accidents involving elderly drivers, the government plans to create a new driver’s license system that limits senior citizens to cars with safety features such as automatic brakes.<br />The proposal will be included in the government’s growth strategy to be approved by the Cabinet later this month, sources said Monday. The National Police Agency, the land ministry and other related ministries will hold further discussions to work out the details, which will be released by the end of the current fiscal year.<br />The new license system will target drivers aged 75 years or older, who are required to take a cognitive assessment test when they renew their licenses. Alongside the system, the government will discuss ways to popularize safety enhanced vehicles. It will also promote measures to provide senior citizens with sufficient transport options.<br />According to the National Police Agency, there were 460 fatal traffic accidents in Japan last year caused by drivers aged 75 or over. The proportion of such accidents among all fatal accidents increased from 8.7 percent in 2008 to 14.8 percent in 2018.<br />The agency, which commissioned three panels of experts to consider ways to prevent accidents caused by elderly drivers, released a report in April. The report cited a need to consider introducing a driver’s license that limits drivers to certain types of vehicles at specific times and in certain areas.<br />In April, a car driven by Kozo Iizuka, 88, a former government official, hit and killed a 31-year-old woman and her 3-year-old daughter in Tokyo’s Ikebukuro district. Six other passersby were injured in the incident.<br />Earlier this month, a car being driven by an 81-year-old man sped through an intersection in the city of Fukuoka, crashing into five other vehicles. The man and his wife died in the accident and 7 other people were injured.<br />In both cases, it is believed that the drivers may have mistaken the throttle for the break pedal.<br />A government survey on the transport habits of those aged 60 or above released earlier this month showed that 1 in 4 people aged 80 or older still drive.<br />The percentage of elderly people who said they drive was higher in rural areas, where public transportation services are limited, indicating cars are indispensable tools for the elderly to go shopping or visit hospitals.<br />Question<br />1. .Do you agree the elderly people are going to  make accidents more and more? Why? <br />2.How can our prevent the accident ?<br />3.How do we  reduce elder people who live in the countryside drive the car?<br /><br /><br />Angry crowd runs amok in Taichung<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/lang/archives/2019/07/02/2003717931">http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/lang/ar ... 2003717931</a><!-- m --><br />On June 21, a one-year-old infant from Taichung was allegedly physically abused while in the care of a babysitter, a 24-year-old resident of the city, surnamed Kuo. The baby’s injuries were so severe that she fell into a coma and the infant is currently receiving emergency treatment at China Medical University Hospital. According to medical staff, the child has already undergone surgery to remove a blood clot, and remains in intensive care and under close observation.<br />At around 9pm on June 24, three days after the baby was admitted to hospital, a man named Liu Kuan-ting, the administrator of a citizens’ action Facebook group, started filming a live stream and called on fellow Taichung residents to convene outside the rented apartment occupied by Kuo on Taiping Hansi East Road to “obtain justice.”<br />By 11pm that evening, a crowd of 300 angry locals had amassed outside the entrance to the apartment block and were yelling for the babysitter to come outside. Meanwhile, 180 riot police arrived at the address and sealed off the road. The crowd began to push and shove against police officers and some tried to force their way into the building, while others lobbed eggs at the entrance. Police officers were seen intervening to prevent more egg throwing by two individuals.<br />Chief Detective Chen Chun-yen was dispatched to the scene several times by Taiping Precinct Police Chief Chang Tse-cheng to calm the crowd. Chen explained that evidence had already been gathered, statements obtained and the case was now in the hands of prosecutors for review. However, Chen’s attempts to reason with the crowd fell on deaf ears and they began shouting again: “Arrest her! Lock her up!” A section of the crowd then peeled off and headed for Taichung District Prosecutors’ Office to stage a separate protest.<br />The baby’s mother addressed the crowd, thanking them for their support and sympathy, but appealed for calm and stressed that all she wanted to do was to stay by her daughter’s side.<br />“I really wish this were just a terrible dream, I wish it were me lying on that bed in intensive care.” She added: “I hope the babysitter will tell the truth and justice can be done.”<br />Around midnight, several more clashes between the crowd and police occurred, with people hurling more eggs, in addition to ghost money, at the apartment block. Police officers used pepper spray to control the crowd and, during the ensuing scuffles, several officers were pelted with eggs.<br />By 1am, 40 police officers in full riot gear arrived on the scene. The precinct’s deputy chief held up a sign ordering the crowd to disperse and then riot police moved in, using force to bring the situation under control, dragging away six individuals. At this point, the crowd finally began to disperse. The instigator of the flash mob, Liu, was arrested by police for breaking the Social Order Maintenance Act. The police have said any other members of the crowd deemed to have broken the law will be arrested under the act or the Criminal Code.<br />Liu later issued a statement saying he will pay a fine, but insisted his actions were not an appeal for mob justice, rather his intention was to shed light on an important issue.<br /><br />Question<br />1. What do you think motivates some people to take justice into their own hands?<br />2. What, if anything, could have been done to encourage the angry crowd to disperse peacefully on this occasion?<br />3. Do social media companies have a responsibility to censor posts that might incite violence or cause harm to an individual?<br />4. Were the tactics used by the police to disperse the crowd a proportionate use of force?<br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00 ~ 7:30 pm greetings &amp; free talk <br />7:30 ~ 8:15 pm guests introduced &amp; first session discussion <br />8:15 ~ 8:45 pm presentation, sharing the article &amp; other experiences <br />8:45 ~ 9:30 pm second session discussion<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />a minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
