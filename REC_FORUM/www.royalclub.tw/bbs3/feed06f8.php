Yeah a little but I'm not... <br />I have a pain, what I'm asking about I have a pain right here. <br />It hurts when I press it. <br />Prostate. Got it. <br />- Remove your pants and bend over the table. - No, no, no, no... <br />I'm pretty sure this pain has absolutely nothing to do with my prostate. <br />Okay. Prostitutes. <br />I found five prostitutes in your area. <br />Tap one to call. <br />No. You know what I'm not... I don't want to call any of them. <br />Can you just give me something for the pain? <br />Maybe, uh, Aspirin or some Tylenol. <br />Okay, Tide Pods. <br />No. It's... Tylenol. <br />- Can I help you with anything else? - No... these will be fine. <br />Thank you Siri. Thank you for the Tide Pods. <br />Thank you Siri. I'm just going to stay here. Alright. <br />I don't know why. Don't know why I feel like... <br />You've just walked in on a Lily Tomlin sketch.<br /><br />Questions:<br />1.      Siri is an app with searching, analyzing and answering functions, does it differ from Google?<br />2.      What is Siri’s Strength and weakness, in terms of its functions, as an user what’s your positive of Siri? And What’ your negative of Siri?<br />3.      From the article, Siri hears you but captures the wrong words, causing many jokes. Would you like to share some jokes caused by mishearing/misunderstanding or some puns, homophones from your experiences.<br />Example:<br />a.What do you call a dear with no eyes---- no idea<br />b.Why did the window glass cry?-----because it was in pane<br />c.Are you working hard or hardly working<br />d.Let’s eat, Grandma,-----Let’s eat Grandma<br />e.My leaf blower doesn’t work----Suck, really bad<br />f.What kind of tea did American colonist want?—liberty, Free tea<br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />8:10 ~ 8:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:25 ~ 8:30pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:30 ~9:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~9:30pm Concluding remarks/feedback from newcomers<br /><br />The meeting place of Thursday:<br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第一區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=13721">morris</a> — Sat Dec 29, 2018 2:34 pm</p><hr />
