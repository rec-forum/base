			<div class="content">Session I<br />Trump pulls US from global warming accord, to allies' dismay<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trump-announce-decision-paris-climate-pact-thursday-47763223">http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStor ... y-47763223</a><!-- m --><br />President Donald Trump declared Thursday he was pulling the U.S. from the landmark Paris climate agreement, striking a major blow to worldwide efforts to combat global warming and distancing the country from its closest allies abroad. Framing his decision as &quot;a reassertion of America's sovereignty,&quot; Trump said he was &quot;elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.&quot;<br />He said the U.S. could try to re-enter the deal under more favorable terms or work to establish &quot;an entirely new transaction.&quot; But he indicated that was hardly a priority. &quot;If we can, great. If we can't, that's fine,&quot; he said.<br />Scientists say Earth is likely to reach more dangerous levels of warming sooner as a result of the president's decision because America's pollution contributes so much to rising temperatures. Calculations suggest withdrawal could result in emissions of up to 3 billion tons of additional carbon dioxide a year — enough to melt ice sheets faster, raise seas higher and trigger more extreme weather.<br />By abandoning the world's chief effort to slow the tide of planetary warming, Trump was fulfilling a top campaign pledge after weeks of building up suspense over his decision.<br />The White House indicated it would follow the lengthy exit process outlined in the deal. That means the U.S. would remain in the agreement, at least formally, for another three-and-a-half years, ensuring the issue remains alive in the next presidential election.<br />However, Trump declared, emphasizing every word: &quot;As of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the nonbinding Paris accord.&quot;<br />He is breaking from many of America's staunchest allies, who have expressed alarm about the decision. Several of his top aides also opposed the action, including his daughter Ivanka Trump.<br />Under former President Barack Obama, the U.S. had agreed under the accord to reduce polluting emissions by more than a quarter below 2005 levels by 2025. But the national targets are voluntary, leaving room for the U.S. and the nearly 200 other countries in the agreement to alter their commitments.<br />The leaders of France, Germany and Italy joined to &quot;note with regret&quot; the Trump decision and express doubts about any change in the accord.<br />&quot;We deem the momentum generated in Paris in December 2015 irreversible, and we firmly believe that the Paris Agreement cannot be renegotiated, since it is a vital instrument for our planet, societies and economies,&quot; wrote French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italian Premier Paolo Gentiloni.<br />The White House said Trump spoke with the leaders of Germany, France, Canada and Britain Thursday to explain his decision and reassured them that the U.S. is committed to the trans-Atlantic alliance and &quot;robust efforts to protect the environment.&quot;<br />At home, the U.S. Conference of Mayors strongly opposed the decision and said the nation's mayors will continue efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming.<br />Responding to Trump's pointing to his city, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto called the decision &quot;disastrous for our planet, for cities such as Pittsburgh,&quot; and a step that &quot;has made America weaker and the world less safe.&quot;<br />In a rare statement on his successor's policies, Obama said: &quot;Even in the absence of American leadership; even as this administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future, I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got.&quot;<br />Business leaders, normally strong supporters of Republican initiatives, had vigorously appealed to Trump not to abandon the agreement. Many economists believe the accord would likely help create about as many jobs in renewable energy as it might cost in polluting industries.<br />The president, however, argued the agreement had disadvantaged the U.S. &quot;to the exclusive benefit of other countries,&quot; leaving American businesses and taxpayers to absorb the cost.<br />The immediate impact of Trump's move could be largely symbolic. The White House said the U.S. will stop contributing to the United Nations Green Climate Fund and will stop reporting carbon data as required by the Paris accord, although domestic regulations require that reporting anyway. The decision has no direct impact on major U.S. regulations on power plants and car rules currently aimed at reducing carbon emissions, although those are currently under review by Trump as well.<br />&quot;This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States,&quot; Trump said.<br />Congressional Republicans applauded the decision, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky saying Trump had &quot;put families and jobs ahead of left-wing ideology and should be commended.&quot;<br />But House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California called it &quot;a stunning abdication of American leadership and a grave threat to our planet's future.&quot;<br />Trump spoke from the White House Rose Garden on a warm, sunny day. Seated in the front row were aides who had advocated for the withdrawal, including EPA administrator Scott Pruitt and chief strategist Steve Bannon. During Trump's speech, the faint sounds of protesters could be heard in the distance banging drums.<br />Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who had urged Trump to stay in the Paris deal, did not attend the ceremony, nor did Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, both close advisers to the president who supported staying in the agreement. A White House official said the couple instead attended service at synagogue for the Jewish holiday of Shavuot.<br />Business investors seemed pleased, with stock prices, already up for the day, bumping higher as he spoke and the Dow Jones industrial average rising 135 points for the day.<br />As for the mechanics of withdrawal, international treaties have a four-year cooling off period from the time they go into effect. Trump promised to stop implementation of the &quot;non-binding&quot; parts of the deal immediately.<br />The U.S. is the world's second-largest emitter of carbon, following only China. Beijing, however, has reaffirmed its commitment to meeting its targets under the Paris accord, recently canceling construction of about 100 coal-fired power plants and investing billions in massive wind and solar projects.<br />White House aides have been divided on the question of staying or leaving the accord and had been deliberating on &quot;caveats in the language&quot; as late as Wednesday, one official said. But Trump's statement was clear and direct.<br />So was opposition from environmental groups.<br />&quot;Generations from now, Americans will look back at Donald Trump's decision to leave the Paris Agreement as one of the most ignorant and dangerous actions ever taken by any president,&quot; Sierra Club executive director Michael Brune said in a statemen<br />Q1. What do you think about Trump pulling out from the global warming accord?<br />Q2. What is the impact of Trump’s action? How does it affect the accord after the American withdrawal? <br />Q3. Who benefits most from this event?<br />Q4. Can it help American industry and increase job opportunity in the U.S.A? <br />Q5. Can the Paris Accord reach its goal without the USA? <br />Session II<br />In documenting Taiwan, filmmaker makes ultimate sacrifice<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2017/06/11/498564/in-documenting.htm">http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/nati ... enting.htm</a><!-- m --><br /><br />TAIPEI, Taiwan -- The Chinese names of the filmmaker Chi Po-lin (齊柏林) and his award-winning documentary &quot;Beyond Beauty: Taiwan from Above&quot; (看見台灣) were displayed on the Taipei 101 Tower on Sunday, June 11, as Taiwan marked the passing the filmmaker who died in a helicopter crash in Hualien on Saturday. <br /><br />Chi gave up many things to pursue his dream of documenting Taiwan through aerial photography.<br /><br />He mortgaged his house, borrowed money from friends and quit his job as a civil servant at the age of 47 -- just three years before qualifying for a lifetime pension -- all to make his 2013 documentary &quot;Beyond Beauty&quot;, which became the highest grossing documentary in Taiwan's history.<br /><br />On June 10, the acclaimed 52-year-old director gave up his life doing what he loved most -- shooting images of his homeland from a helicopter.<br /><br />The chopper that carried the father of two and his 25-year-old assistant photographer crashed while filming in eastern Taiwan's Hualien County, resulting in their death and that of the pilot. The team was filming for the sequel to &quot;Beyond Beauty&quot; at the time of the accident.<br /><br />News of Chi's death stunned film and cultural circles.<br /><br />&quot;Contemporary Taiwan has just lost someone like Chi Po-lin -- a man of conscience who is willing to sacrifice himself,&quot; said commercial director Kurt Lu (盧建彰), who shot a short film featuring Chi for Google Inc. in 2012.<br /><br />Lu, who later became close friends with Chi, described the director as a warm and kind person.<br /><br />&quot;He always carried a smile on his face, and almost never got angry with people, whether he was dealing with work or other challenges,&quot; Lu said. &quot;I never saw him use mean words toward others. He was always a warm person.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;He risked his life in the air for every photograph he took. My heart aches tremendously,&quot; another friend, TV commentator Sisy Chen (陳文茜), wrote on her Facebook page.<br /><br />Chi, who had over 20 years of experience shooting images from helicopters, appeared to be fully aware of the risk involved. In his past writings and interviews, the director had recounted some of the scary moments, especially when filming over mountainous areas.<br /><br />One time, filming at Yushan, Taiwan's highest mountain, the pilot of Chi's helicopter lost control of the aircraft momentarily after encountering a turbulence, Chi wrote in one of his books.<br /><br />&quot;My mind went blank. Before I could say my prayers, I screamed and shouted instinctively. In those seconds, I really believed the chopper was going to go down.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;That wasn't the only time...fortunately, we were always able to pull off a narrow escape. But no matter how many times this has occurred, I am still frightened when it does. I never dare tell my family these things because I am afraid they would worry.&quot;<br /><br />Every time something like this happened, Chi told himself to quit flying and not take the risk. <br /><br />&quot;But, after I wake up the next day or after some time has passed, and I see the good weather and good visibility, I always want to fly again,&quot; he wrote.<br /><br />During a press conference two days before the crash, Chi told reporters that he chose not to use drones but to do the filming himself because images produced by drones are of an inferior quality and he would not be able to live with that.<br /><br />Chi's passion for aerial photography began while he was an employee at the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, where he was responsible for documenting major construction projects, such as highway projects, from the air.<br /><br />As his interest grew, Chi rented helicopters during his free time to take still images of Taiwan's mountains, coastline and other places.<br /><br />In 2009, after witnessing the damage inflicted by Typhoon Morakot, which triggered the worst flooding in Taiwan in half a century, Chi purchased his own filming equipment at a price of about NT$30 million, quit his job and set off to make a film to warn people about the importance of environmental protection.<br /><br />&quot;At the age of 47, just three years before I became eligible for retirement, I quit my civil servant job to become a full-time aerial photographer. I will be dedicating the rest of my life to what I love the most. I'm very frightened, but very happy,&quot; he wrote in his book.<br /><br />Chi's &quot;Beyond Beauty: Taiwan from Above&quot; cost NT$90 million (US$2.99 million) and took three years, including 400 hours in the air, to complete. It is widely considered to have played an important role in making local people more aware of the beauty of the island, as well as the man-made environmental destruction to which it had been subjected as a result of decades of rapid economic growth.<br /><br />The film won the best documentary award at the 50th Golden Horse Awards, Taiwan's equivalent to the Oscars.<br /><br />It also led to a government crackdown on environmental offenses such as illegally builtguesthouses in mountainous areas, industrial pollution in rivers and illegal mining operations.<br /><br />In a 2011 video, in which Chi was filmed speaking with then president Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九), the director said he hoped to become the Taiwanese peoples' &quot;pair of eyes in the sky&quot; and to show the country's natural beauty to its people.<br /><br />Following Chi's death on Saturday, Chi's son wrote in an online post that his father &quot;loved (Taiwan) so much he was prepared to give up his life.&quot;<br /><br />Speaking at the press conference on June 8, which was World Oceans Day, Chi, wearing a blue suit, announced his ambitions for the sequel set to be released in 2019.<br /><br />The director said he visited more than 30 countries to scout for locations and planned to film it mostly in Taiwan but also in other countries, such as Japan, New Zealand, Malaysia and China, because he wanted people to recognize that environmental problems know no borders. <br /><br />In addition to filming from the air, the new documentary would also take viewers under ocean and discuss problems such as marine trash, Chi said.<br /><br />The film would also trace the footsteps of Taiwan's ancestors and teach people about the plate collision that formed Taiwan, he said.<br /><br />&quot;I hope the sequel will allow more people to get to know the past, present and future of Taiwan. I especially hope that it will give our young people an international perspective...and allow the world to see more of Taiwan, and Taiwan the world.&quot;<br /><br />In a concert in Tainan City Saturday night, Vox Nativa children's choir, which appeared in an iconic scene on top of Yushan mountain in &quot;Beyond Beauty,&quot; performed Chi's favorite song, the Japanese song &quot;Kikyuu ni Notte Dokomade mo&quot; (Fly Away on a Balloon), to remember the director.<br /><br />&quot;He is free now. He will truly fly in the sky forever,&quot; said Akuan Liao (廖阿貫), an executive member of Vox Nativa Association, Taiwan.<br />Q1. Why was the aircraft crash so shocking to the Taiwan people?<br />Q2. Chi had told himself to quit flying and not take the risk. But what encouraged him to want to fly again?<br />Q3. In what way do you respect Chi most?<br />Q4. Chi set off to make a film to warn people about the importance of environmental protection. Do you think his film and death could lead to a government crackdown on environmental offenses?<br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:05pm discussion session (35 mins)<br />8:05 ~ 8:20pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:20 ~ 8:25pm Regrouping <br />(Session II)<br />8:25 ~ 8:35pm Taking a 10 minutes break (Intermission)<br />8:35 ~ 9:10pm discussion session (35 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~ 9:30pm Concluding remarks/feedback from newcomers<br /><br />The meeting place of Thursday:<br />摩斯漢堡明曜店 (明曜百貨後面第二條巷子地下室)<br />台北市大安區仁愛路四段151巷37號B1樓<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運 - 板南線 - 忠孝敦化站 (步行約5分鐘)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
