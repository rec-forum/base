Hope they are informative and thought-provoking enough for us to learn from and discuss.<br /><br />Session I: Why Is Everyone So Bad At Giving Gifts?<br />Do you often receive an unwelcome gift?  According to the video, around 70 billion dollars’ worth of presents are returned every year in the U.S. In this video, The Atlantic writer Derek Thompson explains why many presents amount to what economists call “deadweight loss”: the company wasted time making it, the giver wasted time buying it, and the receiver wasted time returning it. <br />So, how do we design a gift-giving formula that strikes the right balance between efficient, practical, and sentimental? Please watch the following video:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9UUu2JBQB0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9UUu2JBQB0</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The Tips are summarized as follows, <br />1.Stop trying to make your gifts so delightful.<br />2.When in doubt, give cash. <br />3.Just give people what they ask for. <br /><br />Questions:<br />1.Had you received any gift for Moon Festival? If yes, what kind of gifts were they, and did you like them?  <br />2.Do you think gift-giving is important or common in Taiwan now? Why or why not?<br />3.What is the best/ worst gift you have received?  Why do you like/dislike it so much?<br />4.According to the video, around 70 billion dollars’ worth of presents are returned every year in the U.S.  What might be the reasons for that?<br />5.Do you think the speaker’s tips for gift-giving is useful or practical? From your experience, what might be other tips also useful?<br /><br /><br />Session II: Japanese life expectancy sees 1st decline in 10 years amid pandemic<br /><br />Life expectancy in Japan has fallen for the first time in 10 years, according to data released by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.<br />The data shows an average life expectancy of 87.57 years for women and 81.47 years for men in 2021. The figures are a decrease from record highs of 87.71 years for women and 81.56 years for men in 2020.<br />Life expectancy in Japan had been increasing every year since 2011 — which was the last time life expectancy fell. That year, the effects of the strongest earthquake recorded in the country's history, and the tsunami that followed, left more than 18,000 people dead or missing.<br />As reported by The Japan Times, the ministry says the recent decrease is an effect of COVID-19, adding that the virus was the reason for lower figures for most men.<br />However, Japan has previously set global records for life expectancy. A 2016 study published in BMC Research Notes found that Japan had the longest life expectancy in the world in 2013, and noted that it was the first to achieve an average male life expectancy of more than 80 years.<br />According to World Population Review, Hong Kong currently has the highest life expectancy in the world, at 87.8 years for women and 82 years for men. Japan is second, followed by Macau, which has a life expectancy of 87.2 years for women and 81.3 years for men.<br />Based on data from the UN, average global life expectancy was 72.8 years in 2019, and is expected to increase to 77.2 years in 2050.<br /><br />Questions:<br />1.Do you find it surprising that life expectancy in Japan has fallen for the first time in 10 years? What are the reasons?<br />2.Why is Japan one of the highest life-expectancy countries in the world? How about Hong Kong, which currently has the highest life expectancy?<br />3.In your opinion, where would be the best places to retire in Taiwan? Where would be the best long-stay places in other countries?<br />4.Who is the oldest person you know? What might be the reasons for him/her to live so long?<br />5.What's the best advice about getting old you've heard? Or do you have any advices for the younger generation? <br /><br />P.S.<br />1.參加三次(含實體及線上會議)後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />2.請帶著開放的心與熱情來參加全英文會話聚會!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=13721">morris</a> — Wed Sep 07, 2022 5:00 pm</p><hr />
