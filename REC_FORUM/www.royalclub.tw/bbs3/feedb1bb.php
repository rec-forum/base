Which is more important? The baby’s right to live or the parent’s right to choose?<br />II.Do you think abortion, like gambling, prostitution, is part of human natural demand and freedom and can’t be effectively eradicated? And hence shouldn’t be limited by means of law?  <br />III.What are the possible reasons for women to choose to stop their pregnancy? Do you support abortion without any reason?<br />IV.If you support women’s right to abort, which trimester （妊娠期）should be legal to do the abortion? If you don’t, which trimester shouldn’t be allowed to do it?<br /><br />Here are some information in Chinese for your reference:<br /><br />妊娠通常可分為3個時期。第一期定義為受精當週起算第1-12週。受精後所形成的受精卵會經輸卵管向下移動，接觸子宮內層著床，並開始發育成胎兒與胎盤[1]。第一期所承受的流產（胚胎或胎兒自然死亡）風險為三期之最[6] 。第二期定義為第13-28週。在第二期中期，可能會感受到胎兒活動。第28週時，如果接受高品質醫療照護，大於90%的胎兒可在子宮外存活（英語：Fetal viability）。第三期定義為第29-40週[1]。懷孕初期因初著床，流產機率較高；懷孕中期開始，胎兒較易以儀器監測；懷孕後期，胎兒開始具備母體外存活能力，也因如此，法律和習俗多視懷孕後期的胎兒為個人。<br /><br />有健保補助的第一次產檢，大部分會安排懷孕6-8週之間，胚胎這時候約0.2-0.4公分，這2週通常就可以從超音波掃到寶寶的心臟雛形，這時候醫師會依據寶寶心跳的情形，判定正常與否，寶寶心跳速率，平均是每分鐘120-160下，非常迅速、規律，是成人心跳的2倍。除了心臟，還有腎臟、大腦、脊髓、腸胃也是這週發育的重點。<br /><br />刑法 #288<br />懷胎婦女服藥或以他法墮胎者，處六月以下有期徒刑、拘役或三千元以下罰金。<br />懷胎婦女聽從他人墮胎者，亦同。<br />因疾病或其他防止生命上危險之必要，而犯前二項之罪者，免除其刑。<br />優生保健法 #9<br />懷孕婦女經診斷或證明有下列情事之一，得依其自願，施行人工流產：<br />一、本人或其配偶患有礙優生之遺傳性、傳染性疾病或精神疾病者。<br />二、本人或其配偶之四親等以內之血親患有礙優生之遺傳性疾病者。<br />三、有醫學上理由，足以認定懷孕或分娩有招致生命危險或危害身體或精神健康者。<br />四、有醫學上理由，足以認定胎兒有畸型發育之虞者。<br />五、因被強制性交、誘姦或與依法不得結婚者相姦而受孕者。<br />六、因懷孕或生產，將影響其心理健康或家庭生活者。<br />未婚之未成年人或受監護或輔助宣告之人，依前項規定施行人工流產，應得法定代理人或輔助人之同意。有配偶者，依前項第六款規定施行人工流產，應得配偶之同意。但配偶生死不明或無意識或精神錯亂者，不在此限。<br />第一項所定人工流產情事之認定，中央主管機關於必要時，得提經優生保健諮詢委員會研擬後，訂定標準公告之。<br /><br /><br />Session 2: Coping with toxic people<br /><br />Develop some tools for dealing with difficult people<br /><br />Dealing with a toxic person is never fun, but having to try to please a toxic person who has power over you can be pure torture. If you find yourself in this unfortunate situation, don’t despair. There are things you can do to preserve your working relationship and your own sanity at the same time.<br /><br />  Many employed people believe that if only they could work for themselves, they’d never have to put up with a rude, manipulative overly demanding person over again, or at least not at work. Those of us who are self-employed know better. Instead of a single bad boss, we may have to answer to multiple demanding clients or suffer through high-handed treatment from people who believe the old adage that the customer is always right.<br /><br />  In an insightful post at Psychology Today, Clinical psychologist Seth Meyers offers some solid advice for dealing with toxic people:<br /><br />1.Avoid sharing personal information or your true opinions<br />  knowledge is power, and the more a toxic person knows about you, the more power he or she will have over you. While openness and honesty can help you create a healthy relationship in most situations, a toxic person can put you in danger of further emotional abuse or manipulation.<br />  Avoid telling the toxic person anything you wouldn’t want the whole word to know. Don’t share information about your personal life, and , in particular, if you have strong feelings about something being discussed, don’t let the toxic person know.<br />  “Anything with emotional content should be avoided with a difficult person who has power over you”, Meyers writes. The less a toxic person knows about your, then less ammunition he or she has.<br />2.Always be prepared, organized and centered<br />  The more prepared you are in any encounter with the toxic person, the better. Have all the data you need, and make sure you are up to date with best to make sure you feel emotionally calm and strong in the toxic persons presence. He or she will have the greatest power over you “when you are caught off guard, feeling vulnerable or upset in any away”, Meyers writes.<br />3.Get the toxic person to like you<br />  It may be the last thing you want to do , and yet it can help tip the balance of power in your favor, if only a little bit. There are many ways to make someone like you, but one of the most surprising is to ask that person for a favor. Follow this advice, and something surprising may happen—you may start to dislike the toxic person a little less.<br />  Most toxic people got that way for a reason, and the more you learn about their history, the more you may understand their motivations. You may even be able to change the dynamic of your relationship for the better.<br />4.Take care of yourself<br />  Having to answer to a toxic person is incredibly wearing. If you are in that situation, taking care of your own emotional and physical health should be a top priority. This includes things such as meditation or journal writing . But it’s also important to include activities that let you deal with your frustrations and blow off steam, such as talking with understanding friends and engaging in sports.<br />  “When you are entrenched in such a difficult, no-way-to-win dynamic, utilize multiple coping skills to manage the complex feelings that arise,” Meyers advises.<br />  Ultimately, the best way to take care of yourself if you have to answer to a toxic person is to get out of that situation as soon as you can. Find a new customer or business partner, branch out into a different area of do whatever you must to remove yourself fro the toxic person’s power.<br />  That may seem difficult, but as Meyers says, stop and ask yourself how long you can put up with the toxicity before your emotional and physical health are affected. Dealing with a toxic person “is a chronic problem as long as you stay in the orbit of that difficult personality,” he writes. Once you do escape that orbit, you may be surprised to learn how much more mental and emotional energy you have now that they‘re not being drained. <br /><br />(Cited from StudioClassroom, June, 2022)<br /><br /><br />Questions:<br />1.Do you know anybody in your career that are really toxic? How toxic were they?<br />2.Toxic people always want to gain advantage from other people through manipulating. They pry into privacy and secrets and use that as means to sideline their opponents and to build up groupings against others. How do you deal with toxic people like that?<br />3.Some people may not mean to be that mean, but they do behave in a way that get people around them really annoyed or agitated. Ex. poor hygienic habit, unwelcome body contact, rude and not respecting. How do you handle with these sorts of people? <br />4.One of the tips in this article is: “Get the toxic person to like you” which means in fact to probe into their minds and to understand them. How do you make friends with those people you don’t like?<br /><br /><br />P.S.<br />1.參加三次(含實體及線上會議)後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />2.請帶著開放的心與熱情來參加全英文會話聚會!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38674">Louie Wang</a> — Tue Jun 28, 2022 10:22 pm</p><hr />
