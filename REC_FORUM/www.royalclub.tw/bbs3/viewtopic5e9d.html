			<div class="content">Article I : Eight Lessons In Long-Distance Love<br />By Jillian Goltzman, July 10th 2014<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/jillian-goltzman/2014/07/eight-lessons-in-long-distance-love/">https://thoughtcatalog.com/jillian-golt ... ance-love/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />One year ago, I was hesitant to start a relationship at all, let alone a long-distance one. After a tumultuous breakup that resembled a World War, I took a hiatus from exercising my poor choice in men and embarked on a personal project. With somewhat of an “Eat, Pray, Love” mindset, a handful of unappealing first dates, and a library of female-focused literature of the “Lean In” variety, I was bent on staying single.<br /><br />While my persistence was focused on solidarity, I had a suitor who was just as determined. He was intelligent, extremely accomplished, driven, and ridiculously kind; his level of morality soared far above the bar my last relationship set. It all sounds flawless, but he was 1,000 miles away from being perfect.<br /><br />This suitor was a mere acquaintance who had relocated to pursue a career. With no intention of hitting it off, we rekindled and didn’t miss a beat in a passionate text-a-thon. Unquestionable compatibility aside, the miles were intimidating. As I approach my one-year anniversary, I’ve learned far more than I initially signed up for.<br /><br />1. Your independence is still yours.<br />Being previously stuck in a five-year codependent relationship left me feeling like a shell more than a complete person. I finally ended it, got in the car, and realized I could go anywhere and no one would change that. My life as an ex-Stepford Wife took flight. I swiftly explored hobbies, let the social butterfly in me fly free, renewed my passport, and even left the country for a while.<br /><br />When I came across people from my past, they were astonished that I wasn’t chin-deep in a pint of Ben &amp; Jerry’s. Remarkably, freedom tasted far better than sorrow. I didn’t want to start a new relationship and lose this supreme sense of self I’d developed. Having a relationship miles away meant skipping the honeymoon phase—the 90-day vortex of being obsessed with spending time together. I surprised myself with how independent I was in my new relationship. If I checked in, it was to tell my boyfriend how my day was, not to give him a minute-by-minute transcript to prove my trust. My boyfriend helped me realize that achieving my independence wasn’t a pageant crown to pass along to the next victor—it was always going to be mine no matter what relationship I entered.<br /><br />2. Listening becomes a vital skill.<br />In a generation that thrives in virtual settings, you’d think long-distance relationships would be a simple feat. I can tweet, gram, pin, comment, and tumble my way through my 20s, but in-person interaction is still needed in a relationship. Calls drop, poor reception beckons, and WiFi wipes out. When I’m not cursing Skype or playing Hide-and-Go-Find-Cell-Phone-Service, I’m doing my best to listen. I’m guilty of getting sidetracked and responding with an annoying “What did you say?” or even worse, a routine “Yeah.” Engage in a real conversation outside the emoji comfort zone—it’s worth it.<br /><br />3. Try to be Pinteresting.<br />Take a break from pinning your 100-day squat challenge—your opportunity to make your Pinterest boards a reality is now. When I signed up for a long-distance relationship, I unleashed the DIY Girlfriend inside me. From handwritten letters (my personal favorite) to care packages, I was given the opportunity to be as corny as I wanted—all rationally in the name of long-distance love.<br /><br />4. There will be threesomes—and it’s OK.<br />I frequently spoon with my iPhone and dreamily gaze into pixels while on Skype—I’m in a threesome with my boyfriend and an electronic device.<br /><br />While embracing technology without feeling like a scene out of Her, remember that even distant couples need space. Drowning your significant other with minute-by-minute messages can kill your personal productivity, feel like a task, and ultimately lessen the bittersweet feeling of missing someone you love. Experiment to find a communicative balance that works best for both of you.<br /><br />5. Be your own hot date.<br />As someone who has skipped shaving my legs (because who else is going to be that close to me?), I know it’s mindlessly simple to resort to sweatpants and Netflix. Your exterior doesn’t contribute to your worth and it certainly isn’t a reflection of who you are, but pulling yourself together is a gigantic source of confidence. Make time for primping or hitting the gym because it’s a gift to you, not only your significant other.<br /><br />6. Plan ahead.<br />Having an indefinite amount of time between your next in-person interaction can be discouraging. Plan visits or video dates and give yourselves something to look forward to.<br /><br />7. Have an end in sight.<br />Education, career opportunities, and military deployments are only a few of the things keeping couples apart. It doesn’t have to be three months from now or even three years from now, but relationships can’t survive on an indefinite current forever. If you’re serious, consider discussing personal goals and plans to merge your lives into the same place. Starting the conversation may even change your mind and justify whether this is what you want.<br /><br />8. Love transcends latitude and longitude.<br />A relationship doesn’t need a static set of geographic coordinates to make it worthwhile. If I had let the challenge of distance outweigh my gut feelings, I would have sold myself and my happiness short. In the last year, I’ve grown more independent and thoughtful, become a better communicator, grown intellectually, sparked my creativity, and have learned to appreciate time spent with others more than ever before. My heart isn’t tied to a place, but to the idea that when you find love you hold onto it—it’s as simple as that. <br />Discussions:<br />1). Have you ever heard or had a long distance love? What about long distance is easier or harder than you expected?<br />2). What is your favorite part and least favorite one of a long-distance relationship?<br />3). If communication habits of both you does work last year, how can you fix them to be more successful this year?<br />4). Do you think that love can transcends latitude and longitude? If yes, how and what would you do to prove your belief?<br />5). What is one piece of advice you would tell someone about long-distance love?<br />=========================================================================================================<br />Article II : 4 WAYS THAT READING CAN IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF YOUR LIFE AFTER 60<br />BY FRANCES BROWN<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://sixtyandme.com/4-ways-that-reading-can-improve-the-quality-of-your-life-after-60/">http://sixtyandme.com/4-ways-that-readi ... -after-60/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Although I’ve been an avid reader all my life, I’d honestly never heard the term “bibliotherapy” until recently. Apparently, I’ve been out of the loop.<br /><br />The concept of reading books as therapy dates to the ancient Greeks who considered libraries sacred. Above the entrance to the library in Thebes were inscribed the words, “A healing place for the soul.”<br /><br />Through the ages, medical as well as psychiatric physicians have prescribed the reading of books to patients to help them understand their conditions, combat depression or face a life transition.<br /> <br />Reading as a Casual Pastime<br />But what about reading as a casual pastime? I’ve researched the psychology of this activity and experienced a few enlightening revelations.<br /><br />In the words of the French author Marcel Proust, “Reading is for us the instigator whose magic keys open deep within us the door to those dwelling places into which we would have been unable to penetrate.”<br /><br />So, how can picking up a book, or your digital reading device, help improve the quality of your life? Well, surprise! If you are reading this blog, or one of the many others on the Sixty and Me website, you have already begun the journey.<br /><br />In exploring the articles, podcasts and blogs contributed by this community of like-minded women, we improve our day.<br /><br />We learn something, we are entertained, we laugh, we empathize with each other’s sadness. But one thing is for certain: we leave the site with a renewed and enriched view of our own lives. And with a smile.<br /><br />Of course, with the millions of books out there in hundreds, if not thousands of genres on virtually every conceivable subject, the choices are plentiful. Here are some basic avenues you may consider.<br /><br />Self-Help Books<br />Are you dealing with a challenge in your life? Grieving a lost loved one? Facing “empty nest syndrome”? Perhaps you are approaching a transition in your life, like entering retirement, and are unsure as to what on earth you’re going to do with all that time on your hands.<br /><br />Are you socially inept? Has that been keeping you from expanding your circle of friends? These issues are discussed in self-help books.<br /><br />Personal confidence issues are not new to me, especially when approaching a new activity or skill. Recently, I decided to take up horseback riding again after a multi-year hiatus, but fear of failure and injury was holding me hostage.<br /><br />I came across a book called The Confidence Gap by Russ Harris. Reading this book was so uplifting, so inspiring to me, that I found myself able to tackle that personal challenge with gusto.<br /><br />I recommended the book to a dear friend of mine, who suffers from a similar lack of confidence, though in different areas of her life. She said she literally could not put it down, and it caused her to envision an entire shift in her self-image.<br /><br />If you are dealing with a stumbling block in your life, there is a book out there that might open new pathways in your brain and help you find the right answer for you.<br /><br />Educational Books<br />Perhaps you have spent your entire life playing the same roles: at work, with your family, in your relationships, in your recreational activities. The one thing I discovered with delight at the age of 54 was that you are never too old to learn something new.<br /><br />After spending my entire life working in the medical field, utilizing the scientific, logical side of my brain, I realized that the banging I was hearing was my creative side beating on the door, begging to be turned free. I wanted to write.<br /><br />A plethora of books out there exist to help you learn the techniques for whatever kind of writing you want to do. I wanted to pen my memoir, but also had dozens of fictional tales running around in my head.<br /><br />So, I began my own exploration of the world of writing (a form of therapy in its own right). I read books on every aspect of the writing craft I could find. Two years later, I’d not only written both a memoir and a novel, but had secured publication contracts on both of those books.<br /><br />Contrary to the old cliché, you can teach a mature, experienced dog new tricks. This concept applies to every subject, every sport, every hobby. If you have a desire to learn about it, there’s at least a dozen books out there to help you learn the basics and get you started on a fresh, new pathway in your life.<br /><br />Virtual Reality Books<br />No, I’m not talking about the computer-created kind. You don’t need any fancy technological gadgets or expensive software. All you need is a book. Every novel, whether it be literary or mass-market fiction, holds a potential, virtual journey.<br /><br />In the 90s, with the discovery of “mirror neurons,” scientists determined (under CT scan) that the area of the human brain that reacts to an actual experience also lights up when a person either watches someone else experiencing the event – or if they read about it.<br /><br />Emotions add the spice to an otherwise mundane existence. When you read a novel, by empathizing with the characters, you feel their emotions.<br /><br />By the end of a particularly well-developed story, you feel a sense of loss at “losing” your new friends. This explains why series are so popular.<br /><br />Even after completing one of my own novels, I find myself thinking at times, “Gee, I wonder what Marco and Kate are up to this weekend?” As if they are real people, even though these characters only exist in my mind.<br /><br />Travel Books<br />Always wanted to travel abroad? Choose a novel set in the place where you want to visit. I love reading novels set in Scotland. I can take that virtual trip without ever leaving the comfort of my reading chair.<br />What is the best part about the virtual reality journey provided by a novel?<br /><br />There are no limitations. Even time travel is possible. Dive into the past with a historical tale, or jet yourself into the future with a sci-fi. The possibilities are endless.<br /><br />Bibliotherapy is an inexpensive – even free – way to enrich your life. I’ve always treasured libraries as places for endless possibilities and adventure. Borrowing books is free. The invention of the eBook has made purchasing books easier than ever and less expensive.<br /><br />What a freedom we have in today’s world!<br /><br />You are no longer limited by the hours of your local bookstore or library. With the Internet and eBooks, you can choose a book at 3 a.m. on Christmas morning, in the middle of a snowstorm, if it so moves you. A couple of clicks and a few dollars later, you can begin the next chapter of your life-enriching journey – without delay.<br /><br />My prescription for improving your life? Self-medicate with bibliotherapy.<br /><br />Have you read a particularly good book lately? How did it enhance your life? I’d love to hear from you! Let’s have a conversation about your most recent great read.<br /><br />DISCUSSIONS:<br />1). Do you like or dislike reading a book? If yes, what is your way to enjoy reading a book?<br />2). Do you prefer reading printed books or e-books or things on the Internet? Will different types of reading media influence your reading interests?<br />3). Which type of books do you prefer reading? And what new books have you read recently?<br />4). Have you ever cried while reading a book?<br />5). How possible reading a book will influence or even change your future?</div>
