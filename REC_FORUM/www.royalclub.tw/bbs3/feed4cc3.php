<span style="font-weight: bold">Section I</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Morning v/s Night, what's the best time to work out?</span><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/fitness/Morning-v/s-Night-whats-the-best-time-to-work-out/articleshow/55398743.cms">https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/lif ... 398743.cms</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br />It's the perfect time to get into exercise mode. If you haven't already embarked on a regimen, start now to get into that little black dress for Christmas and New Year, which are just over a month away. And like everything else, timing matters. If you're part of the frat that ties its running laces at dawn, you may not be making the wisest choice. A study busts the myth that only a morning workout yields the best results and says those who go to the gym or for a jog post work may just achieve 'a higher level of fitness than those who exercise first thing in the morning' as the body's metabolism adapts better to a routine in the evening or night-time, especially during winter.<br /><br />Psychologists are increasingly delving into the link between exercise and mental health, and have been advocating the benefits of a run after a stressful day. Pop singer Lady Gaga has even hired an around-the-clock guru for her 2 am workout and back in our city, more people are in favour of the night time regimen, too.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><br />City folks take to night-time workouts</span><br />For food photographer Assad Dadan, making a switch from morning to night was a blessing. &quot;I used to work out in the mornings, but with the way I was working — till 3 am — I found that increasingly tough to manage. Even the days I do, I didn't quite have the real strength that one needs at a gym. The body takes longer to normalize once you awaken so going to a gym at that time would just be pushing you to a limit. I found the evening/ night workout left me fresher and was a stress buster. It's also a myth that you can't sleep after a workout; I find that I can't get sleep unless I exercise at night.&quot;<br /><br />Bandra-based business executive Riki Ranglani has been doing freehand body weight training at night for the last few months. &quot;We start by about 8:30 pm and do a lot of handstand push-ups, chest dips and chin-ups. It's a lot of fun as the muscle flexibility is greater at night. There's more energy. During early morning, the body is more dehydrated as you have slept and got up. But through the day you replenish your fluids and food, which results in a better workout it the evening.&quot; The nocturnal hour apart, here's a list of the pros and cons of exercising during both night and morning times...<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #0000FF">Pros</span> </span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Increases mood elevators, gives an energy boost <br /></span>Working out in the morning is said to boost metabolism. A site quotes Dr Cedric Bryant of the American Council of Exercise as saying, &quot;Morning workouts result in better energy levels throughout the day and give you more mental alertness and sharpness.&quot; It stimulates the body's endorphins and other mood-elevators, which leave you in a better frame of mind for the rest of the day. A study by the University of Bristol also found that those who work out before office hours are more energised, calm and productive. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">You get a better night's sleep</span><br />Research from the Appalachian State University finds that those lifting weights at 7 am went to sleep faster than those who did so during the afternoon or later. Experts say the excuse that 'a morning workout leaves one drained and experiencing a loss of focus' only means that he or she must relook at the sleeping schedule and ask if it is enough.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Gyms are quieter</span><br />If you're someone who waits to get your turn at the treadmill, try your luck early morning. Gyms are often quieter at that time so you are bound to get more elbow room.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Your mornings will be calmer </span><br />Are you one of those who can't get out of bed fast? Then the evening/night workout won't steal away your zZz's. Not feeling like you had enough sleep is one of the biggest causes of stress to many.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Allows you to blow off steam from the day</span><br />Had a grueling day at the office? Nothing like a night-time sweat out that eliminate stress, anxieties and frustrations. Exercising in the evening can clear the mind and give it the 'clean slate' it needs before you spend time with the family at night. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Your body is more prepared </span><br />Studies reiterate on how joints and muscles are much more flexible in the evening, which means you're less prone to injuries. You can thus also work out for longer.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #0000FF">Cons</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Yep, you have to wake up...</span><br />If you're not an early riser, getting out of bed in the morning can be extremely difficult, especially on a recurring basis. Bryant warns that if you're not used to exercising in the mornings and force yourself to get up, you may not put as much effort into the exercise as you would later in the day. In addition, if you aren't careful, you can disrupt your sleep schedule, which can lead to sleep deprivation.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Eats into your schedule </span><br />Hitting the gym before work may also be tough as it can hamper your schedule. During the morning everything has to go like clockwork — breakfast at a certain time, then a specific train or bus to catch etc.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">You need to spend more time warming up </span><br />The morning hour is when your muscles and joints are stiffer so you might end up spending more time to loosen up. Warm ups are crucial especially before a more challenging workout. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">More chance of cancelling</span><br />There's a greater chance of distractions propping up on your itinerary at late evening or night — like a movie, night out with friends etc, that can derail your exercise plans and make you skip gym.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Can limit the kind of workout that you do</span><br />The fading light may force you to give up on your favor workout — like a run or brisk walk around the block — owing to safety concerns. For most people, it restricts them to indoor activities at this time.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">You'll have to change your dinner time </span><br />Since you're working out before bedtime ensure that you time your meals right (1.5 hours between dinner and a workout is ideal). Tucking into a heavy meal and then working out leads to poor digestion of food. So, you may have to cut short late work hours and other plans and eat first. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions: </span><br />1. What kind exercise do you like to do in your daily life? What's your favorite time to work out? Why?<br />2.

Friday afternoon, a few days before Christmas 2009. I was the director of operations at a consumer products company in San Francisco, and I was called into a meeting that was already in progress. That meeting turned out to be my exit interview. I was fired, along with several others. I was 64 years old at the time. It wasn't completely unexpected. I signed a stack of papers, gathered my personal effects, and left to join my wife who was waiting for me at a nearby restaurant, completely unaware. Fast-forward several hours, we both got really silly drunk. <br /><br />So, 40 plus years of continuous employment for a variety of companies, large and small, was over. I had a good a network, a good reputation -- I thought I'd be just fine. I was an engineer in manufacturing and packaging. I had a good background. Retirement was, like for so many people, simply not an option for me. So I turned to consulting for the next couple of years without any passion whatsoever. <br /><br />And then an idea began to take root, born from my concern for our environment. I wanted to build my own business, designing and manufacturing biodegradable packaging from waste -- paper, agricultural, even textile waste -- replacing the toxic, disposable plastic packaging to which we've all become addicted. This is called clean technology, and it felt really meaningful to me. A venture that could help to reduce the billions of pounds of single-use plastic packaging dumped each year and polluting our land, our rivers and our oceans, and left for future generations to resolve -- our grandchildren, my grandchildren. <br /><br />And so now at the age of 66, with 40 years of experience, I became an entrepreneur for the very first time. <br /> <br />Thank you. But there's more. <br /><br />Lots of issues to deal with: manufacturing, outsourcing, job creation, patents, partnerships, funding -- these are all typical issues for a start-up, but hardly typical for me. And a word about funding. I live and work in San Francisco. And if you're looking for funding, you are typically going to compete with some very young people from the high-tech industry, and it can be very discouraging and intimidating. I have shoes older than most of these people. <br /><br />But five years later, I'm thrilled and proud to share with you that our revenues have doubled every year, we have no debt, we have several marquee clients, our patent was issued, I have a wonderful partner who's been with me right from the beginning, and we've won more than 20 awards for the work that we've done. But best of all, we've made a small dent -- a very small dent -- in the worldwide plastic pollution crisis. <br /><br />And I am doing the most rewarding and meaningful work of my life right now. I can tell you there's lots of resources available to entrepreneurs of all ages, but what I really yearned for five years ago was to find other first-time entrepreneurs who were my age. I wanted to connect with them. I had no role models, absolutely none. That 20-something app developer from Silicon Valley was not my role model. <br />I'm sure he was very clever – <br /><br />I want to do something about that, and I want all of us to do something about that. I want us to start talking more about people who don't become entrepreneurs until they are seniors. Talking about these bold men and women who are checking in when their peers, in essence, are checking out. And then connecting all these people across industries, across regions, across countries -- building a community. <br /><br />You know, the Small Business Administration tells us that 64 percent of new jobs created in the private sector in the USA are thanks to small businesses like mine. And who's to say that we'll stay forever small? We have an interesting culture that really expects when you reach a certain age, you're going to be golfing, or playing checkers, or babysitting the grandkids all of the time. And I adore my grandchildren -- <br />and I'm also passionate about doing something meaningful in the global marketplace. <br /><br />And I'm going to have lots of company. The Census Bureau says that by 2050, there will be 84 million seniors in this country. That's an amazing number. That's almost twice as many as we have today. Can you imagine how many first-time entrepreneurs there will be among 84 million people? And they'll all have four decades of experience. <br /><br />So when I say, &quot;Let's start talking more about these wonderful entrepreneurs,&quot; I mean, let's talk about their ventures, just as we do the ventures of their much younger counterparts. The older entrepreneurs in this country have a 70 percent success rate starting new ventures. 70 percent success rate. We're like the Golden State Warriors of entrepreneurs – <br /><br />And that number plummets to 28 percent for younger entrepreneurs. This is according to a UK-based group called CMI. <br />Aren't the accomplishments of a 70-year-old entrepreneur every bit as meaningful, every bit as newsworthy, as the accomplishments of a 30-year-old entrepreneur? Of course they are. That's why I'd like to make the phrase &quot;70 over 70&quot; just as -- <br />just as commonplace as the phrase &quot;30 under 30.&quot; <br />Thank you. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />1. Age discrimination has been a fact of cooperate life in some countries. Do you agree or disagree? Why?<br />2. What’s your career plan? Do you want to become an entrepreneur? Why? or why not? <br />3. If you were as this speaker, you were fired, along with several others. What would you do for your follow-up plan?
