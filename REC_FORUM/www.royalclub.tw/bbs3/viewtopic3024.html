There''s been widespread reporting on what went wrong in Taiwan, which for the better part of a year, was lauded as a success story of COVID containment. According to the BBC, Bloomberg, and CNN, Taiwan''s main downfall was complacency. Let''s hear what they''re saying. <br /><br />Will Ripley<br />CNN correspondent<br />The problem when you have a nation of 23 million people that has been largely immune from the worst effects of the pandemic. … Now that you have this outbreak, and case numbers are expected to keep going up every single day, because there was not widespread social distancing, people have that complacency…<br /><br />Touted as a COVID success story, Taiwan now faces its worst local outbreak so far. CNN’s Will Ripley says Taiwan let down its guard. A Bloomberg report also blames complacency as a cause of its COVID crisis.<br /><br />Samson Ellis (May 19)<br />Bloomberg Taipei Bureau chief<br />Taiwan has seen a steadily rising number of cases over the past week from the low single digits a week ago to 333.<br /><br />The Bloomberg piece questions Taiwan’s decision to shorten airline crew quarantine to three days. It says that prior to the outbreak, Taiwan had “close to zero vaccination” and too little testing, because containment had seemed so effective. It says there was no monitoring of high-risk groups such as adult entertainment workers – who then became the locus of an outbreak.<br /><br />Former Vice President Chen Chien-jen spoke to BBC, saying Japan too had experienced a virus outbreak in its adult entertainment industry. Failing to take a lesson from Japan, Taiwan found itself with a cluster at the Wanhua tea parlors, Chen said. He said many people who tested positive were unwilling to admit they had been to Wanhua, making contact tracing more difficult. “It just reminds us that even when a very small proportion of the population breaks the rules, it will lead to leakages,” he said.<br /><br />Lin Ching-yi<br />Physician <br />At the very beginning of the pandemic, a staff member was infected at a Kaohsiung nightclub. That put everyone on high alert, and we were all on tenterhooks for a period of time. But then the epidemic seemed to calm down, so people stopped thinking about the risks. Over these next two or three weeks, we should all try to reduce our social interactions and to avoid gatherings. Wear a mask properly. My belief is that in another two to three weeks, we’ll be able to bring down the number of infections to the double digits.<br /><br />Physician Lin Ching-yi called on the public to keep masks on and to limit person-to-person contact. Once domestic COVID vaccines are available, she says, Taiwan will be able to snap the chain of transmission.<br /><br />Q1. According to the BBC, Bloomberg, and CNN, Taiwan's main downfall was complacency. What do you think the infection control breach is?<br />Q2. What shall we do right now to avoid infection from COVID-19?<br />Q3. The Health Minister asks people to avoid weekend outings. So what is your favorite thing to do at home on weekends?<br />Q4. What is the most effective method to stop the spread of COVID-19? <br />Q5. If you were Health Minister Chen in government, what should you regret doing or not doing?<br /><br />Session II:<br />What’s the key to happiness?<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/features/6-minute-english/ep-210311">https://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/e ... /ep-210311</a><!-- m --><br />Introduction<br />Feeling happy is more important than ever right now, especially as many things seem to be out of our control.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil.<br />Georgina<br />And I’m Georgina.<br />Neil<br />That’s a big smile on your face, Georgina! You seem happy today!<br />Georgina<br />I am, Neil. After all, what’s the point in seeing the glass half empty?<br />Neil<br />Ah, so you’re someone who tries to see the glass half full – you generally look at things in a positive way.<br />Georgina<br />I hope so! It may seem strange to be discussing happiness in the middle of a global pandemic but right now feeling happy is more important than ever.<br />Neil<br />Well then, it’s lucky that happiness is the subject of this programme, Georgina. And while many things seem to be out of our control just now, there are small things we can do to feel better about life…<br />Georgina<br />…to feel less stressed, and maybe even a little happier.<br />Neil<br />You’re talking like a Dane now, Georgina. Denmark, and in fact all the Nordic countries, are often listed as among the happiest places in the world.<br />Georgina<br />You know what would make me happy, Neil? – asking me a really good quiz question.<br />Neil<br />OK. Well, did you know that every year the UN publishes its Global Happiness Survey revealing the happiest countries in the world? It’s based on factors like income, life expectancy and health. The Nordic countries often come in the top ten, but which country was rated the happiest in 2020? Was it:<br />a) Iceland?,<br />b) Denmark?, or,<br />c) Finland?<br />Georgina<br />Well, Neil, Denmark is famous for bacon, and nothing makes me happier than a bacon sandwich, so I’ll say b) Denmark.<br />Neil<br />I like your thinking, Georgina! We’ll find out the answer later, but you’re certainly right to say that Denmark is considered one of the happiest countries in the world.<br />Georgina<br />Malene Rydahl, author of the bestselling book, Happy as a Dane, believes that aspects of Danish culture can help us improve our chances of happiness.<br />Neil<br />Here she is explaining what happiness means for her to BBC World Service programme, The Conversation. See if you can hear what she thinks:<br />Malene Rydahl<br />Well, I think we should be seeking alignment and I think we should practise gratitude and I think that we should be more conscious about how we relate to things that happen to us and how much we compare ourselves to others… I do think that what we need to focus on is the quality of our relationships.<br />Georgina<br />Did you hear Malene use the word alignment? She thinks there should be harmony between my true sense of who I am, what I think and how I relate to others. We should be in alignment – or in the correct relation, to those things.<br />Neil<br />Malene also thinks happiness comes from gratitude – feeling grateful and expressing thanks to other people.<br />Georgina<br />She recommends finding three things, no matter how small, to be grateful for every day.<br />Neil<br />Like… getting a good night’s sleep, drinking a hot coffee… and having this chat with you, Georgina.<br />Georgina<br />Thanks, Neil, that’s put a smile on my face! It may sound strange but doing this every day can really boost your happiness levels.<br />Neil<br />Malene also warns against seeking happiness in external things, as you can hear in this chat with BBC World Service’s, The Conversation:<br />Malene Rydahl<br />If you seek happiness and you mistake it for pleasure, you will be running around like a little hamster in a wheel because it’s never enough and because you will be very quickly the victim of the hedonic treadmill… and the hedonic treadmill is… you know, you want something, you think if you’re more beautiful, if you get more power, if you get more money and fame and then you’ll finally be happy… and then you get it and you get a small satisfaction.<br />Neil<br />According to Malene, chasing external pleasures like money and fame will leave you feeling like a hamster on a wheel – like someone who’s always busy but never accomplishes anything useful or finishes what they start.<br />Georgina<br />She also says it’s easy to become a victim of the hedonic treadmill. This is the idea that humans adapt to whatever level of happiness they achieve. As we make more money, meet the perfect boyfriend or whatever we desire, our expectations also increase, so we never find the happiness we hoped we would!<br />Neil<br />‘Money can’t buy happiness’, as my grandma used to say.<br />Georgina<br />Right. In fact, it’s probably the quality of our relationships, not external objects, that gives satisfaction – the pleasure we feel when we achieve something we wanted to.<br />Neil<br />Lots of useful tips there, Georgina, for feeling as happy as a Dane.<br />Georgina<br />A Dane, you say, Neil? So I got the correct answer?<br />Neil<br />In my quiz question I asked Georgina which Nordic country was rated happiest in the UN’s 2020 global survey.<br />Georgina<br />I guessed, b) Denmark.<br />Neil<br />But in fact, Georgina, it was… c) Finland. I guess their bacon sandwiches are even better!<br />Georgina<br />OK, let’s recap the vocabulary and start seeing the glass half full – looking at things in a positive way.<br />Neil<br />Happiness might be all about alignment – being in the correct relation to things.<br />Georgina<br />Or gratitude – being grateful and giving thanks.<br />Neil<br />Feeling like a hamster on a wheel means you’re always busy doing things but without getting satisfaction - the pleasant feeling of achieving something you really wanted to.<br />Georgina<br />Finally, the reason happiness often escapes us may involve the hedonic treadmill - the human tendency to return to the same level of happiness after something very good or very bad has happened.<br />Neil<br />That’s all for this programme. We hope it’s lifted your spirits and given you some useful vocabulary as well.<br />Georgina<br />Remember to join us again soon for more interesting topics here at 6 Minute English.

What are you grateful for?<br />Q4. Why shall we avoid chasing external pleasures?<br />Q5.
