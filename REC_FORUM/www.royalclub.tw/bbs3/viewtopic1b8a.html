				<div class="content">Bitcoin continued its rollercoaster ride on Friday, hitting a new high above $17,000 (£12,615) before falling.  BBC News, 8 Dec. 2018<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42275564">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-42275564</a><!-- m --><br />The digital currency slid as low as $13,963, according to Coindesk.com, before rallying again to trade at about $15,600 on Friday afternoon. Bitcoin has soared about 70% this week, with its dramatic rise being likened to a &quot;charging train with no brakes&quot;. As concerns mount, an industry group has warned plans to start Bitcoin futures trading have been &quot;rushed&quot;. Critics have said Bitcoin is going through a bubble similar to the dotcom boom, but others argue it is rising in price because it is crossing into the financial mainstream.&quot;Bitcoin now seems like a charging train with no brakes,&quot; said Shane Chanel, from Sydney-based ASR Wealth Advisers. Nigel Green, of financial consultancy deVere Group, said he expected Bitcoin to see-saw in coming weeks. &quot;Today's digital world needs crypto-currencies. One or two of the existing ones will succeed. Whether it's Bitcoin or not remains to be seen,&quot; he added.<br />•	Millions 'stolen' in NiceHash Bitcoin heist<br />•	What's behind the Bitcoin gold rush?<br />•	Bitcoin: Risky bubble or the future?<br />•	US regulator approves Bitcoin trading<br />The surging price of Bitcoin has been helped by the start of trading on the Chicago-based Cboe Futures Exchange on Sunday. The world's largest futures exchange, CME, will begin its Bitcoin offering a week later.<br />Trading on futures exchanges allows investors to buy and sell contracts for the crypto-currency at a certain point in the future at an agreed price. Tim McCourt, CME's global head of equity index and alternative investment products, said customers are excited but he is not certain how much interest the futures will attract in the first days of trading. He said he will consider the launch successful if there is a balance of buyers and sellers, and market movements correspond to the underlying Bitcoin price. &quot;That's the larger measure of success,&quot; he said. &quot;What does the market look like - not necessarily how much does it trade.&quot;<br />'Weighing the risks'?<br />The Futures Industry Association, which includes Wall Street's largest banks, brokers and traders, has written to the US regulator over concerns that the contracts were approved &quot;without properly weighing the risks&quot;. &quot;A more thorough and considered process would have allowed for a robust public discussion among clearing member firms, exchanges and clearing houses,&quot; the association said. Edward Tilly, chief executive of Cboe, said he thinks the criticism is unfair. He said his firm worked extensively with regulators to figure out how this would work. For example, the firm set up rules in the contracts to address concerns that Bitcoin's value has sometimes varied widely, depending on the exchange. &quot;This is a walk-before-you-run launch,&quot; he said. &quot;It is mindful that this is new to the marketplace. &quot;While Goldman Sachs is a member of the futures industry association, it is also one of the banks that will work as an intermediary to help clear Bitcoin futures contracts for some clients. A spokeswoman for the investment bank said it was evaluating the risks as part of its due diligence process. Many big investors have been reluctant to pile into the crypto-currency market unless it is regulated. However, the prospect of a Bitcoin futures market has raised hopes that it will be regarded as sufficiently &quot;regulated&quot;. <br />Major gamble'<br />While Bitcoin has become more mainstream in recent weeks, many observers warn the market could be a bubble waiting to pop. Mr. Green added: &quot;Bitcoin remains a major gamble as it is very much an asset that remains in uncharted waters... an asset that goes almost vertically up should typically raise alarm bells for investors. &quot;Even a crash or a major correction is unlikely to pose risks to the global economy, some analysts say. While billions of dollars have been invested in Bitcoin, its $268bn total market value is still small compared to other asset classes. <br />Discussions :<br />a.	Before reading this articles, do you know “Bitcoin” ? Show us your understanding about this new currency.                                                                    <br />b.	While Bitcoin has become more mainstream in recent weeks, many observers warn the market could be a bubble waiting to pop. Are you interesting in buying Bitcoin as the investment in the future? <br />c.	Biticoin remains a major gamble for the time being .Do you think that it will become one of real currencies for using in the market in the near future?  <br />A Japanese firm is planning to use a drone to force employees out of their offices by playing music at them if they stay to work evening overtime. BBC News, 8 Dec. 2017<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-42275874">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-42275874</a><!-- m --><br />The drone will fly through offices after hours playing Auld Lang Syne, which is commonly used to announce that stores are closing. Japan has for years been trying to curb excessive overtime and the health issues and even deaths it can cause. Experts were unimpressed, one branding it a &quot;silly&quot; idea. According to Japanese media, office security and cleaning firm Taisei will develop the device with drone maker Blue Innovation and telecommunications company NTT East. The camera-equipped drone will take flights through the office space playing the famous Scottish tune. &quot;You can't really work when you think 'it's coming over any time now' and hear Auld Lang Syne along with the buzz,&quot; Norihiro Kato, a director at Taisei, told news agency AFP. Taisei plans to start the drone service in April 2018 as a trial within their own company and later in the year offer it to others.<br />An effective tool?<br />&quot;Will this help? The short answer is: no,&quot; Seijiro Takeshita, professor of management and information at the University of Shizuoka told the BBC.&quot; It's a pretty silly thing and companies are doing this just because they have to be seen to be doing something on the problem. &quot;The issue of excessive overtime is deeply rooted in the work culture and should be tackled from a more fundamental basis, he argues. &quot;Creating awareness is of course very important - but this is almost a hoax in my opinion.&quot;<br />•	The young Japanese working themselves to death<br />•	Japan firm fined for excessive overtime<br />•	Can cutting hours solve Japan's productivity puzzle?<br />Scott North, professor of sociology at Osaka University, said: &quot;Even if this robotic harassment gets workers to leave the office, they will take work home with them if they have unfinished assignments.&quot; He added: &quot;To cut overtime hours, it is necessary to reduce workloads, either by reducing the time-wasting tasks and tournament-style competitions for which Japanese workplaces are notorious, or by hiring more workers.&quot; Japan has long been struggling to break its decades-old work culture where it is frowned upon to leave before your colleagues or boss. The problem of long hours has even led to the coining of a new word: karoshi, or dying from overwork. The habit, especially among people who are new at a company, is seen as the cause of many health problems leading to strokes, heart attacks and suicides.In October, advertising firm Dentsu was fined for violating labour laws after a young worker killed herself. She was later found to have worked 159 hours of overtime in one month. Earlier this year, the government introduced Premium Fridays, encouraging companies to let their employees leave at 15:00 on the last Friday of each month. But the plan has failed to have an impact so far, with many employees saying the last Friday of the month is one of their busiest days.Reporting by the BBC's Andreas Illmer.<br />Discussions:<br />a.	&quot;The issue of excessive overtime is deeply rooted in the work culture and should be tackled from a more fundamental basis “ . Do you think why overtime is common in Japan ? Do you have this problem in your work ? <br />b.	If you didn’t finish the assignment, will you bring it to go home ? Is it also a kind of overwork ? <br />c.	The problem of long hours has even led to the coining of a new word: karoshi, or dying from overwork.
