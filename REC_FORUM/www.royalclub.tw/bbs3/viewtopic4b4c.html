One study has found that working out with a romantic partner may make people more satisfied with their relationship.<br />The study, which was published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, looked at 95 young adults in the US who were in a relationship and already exercised regularly.<br /><br />The participants completed surveys every night before going to bed for two weeks. The surveys measured their daily exercise, relationship satisfaction and positive and negative affect — or the amount of positive and negative emotions they felt.<br /><br />The researchers found that exercising with a romantic partner was associated with higher positive affect — both during exercise and throughout the day — compared to exercising without a romantic partner.<br />The researchers said this increase in positive affect may help people maintain their exercise routines better.<br />The results also showed that participants were more satisfied with their relationships on days when they exercised with their partners compared to days when they exercised without them.<br />The researchers said this may come from couples doing something valuable together and achieving their health goals.<br /><br />The study found that exercising with a partner didn't have an impact on negative affect during exercise, or throughout the day. The researchers said this may be because the participants were already regular exercisers so their negative affect was already quite low, especially during exercise.<br />Working out with a partner is common. A survey of more than 7,600 UK adults by sports store Decathlon found that 43% have exercised with their partner, 66% said it had improved their relationship and 21% said it made them feel more attracted to them.<br /><br />Questions:<br />1.What are your thoughts on the findings of this study?<br />2.Do you generally exercise alone or with someone?<br />3.What impact would you say exercising has on your emotions?<br />4.Who's the most active couple you know? What kind of sports or activities are they into?</div>
