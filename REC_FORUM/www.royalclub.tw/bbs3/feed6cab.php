Deporting Taiwanese fraud suspects to China.<br /><br />The government yesterday issued a stern protest to the Philippines after Manila joined other nations in succumbing to Chinese pressure and deporting Taiwanese fraud suspects to China.<br />Early yesterday, the Philippine government forcibly deported to China 78 Taiwanese who allegedly engaged in telecom fraud, despite Taipei’s repeated calls for Manila to handle the case discreetly and based on the principle of nationality, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.<br />“We also urged Manila to take into account the suspects’ personal will and send them back to Taiwan to stand trial here,” the ministry said. “However, the Southeast Asian nation still deported our people to China on the grounds that Beijing had repeatedly put pressure on it.”<br />A ministry official, who requested anonymity, said the ministry would recall Manila’s representative after the long Tomb Sweeping Day holiday.<br />The 78 Taiwanese were among 158 people arrested by Philippine police on Jan. 13 for their alleged involvement in telecom fraud.<br />The extradition came only days before Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is scheduled to travel to China to attend the Boao Forum for Asia in Hainan, which is to take place from Sunday to Wednesday next week.<br />Since the first such incident occurred in April 2016, several nations have chosen to abide by Beijing’s “one China” principle and deport Taiwanese fraud suspects to China, including Kenya, Armenia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia and Vietnam.<br />The latest deportation by the Philippines raises the number of Taiwanese telecom fraud suspects who have been deported to China to more than 360.<br />The Mainland Affairs Council said in a statement that Beijing’s actions were counterproductive to both the crackdown on cross-border telecom fraud and the development of cross-strait relations.<br />“The repeated emergence of new cross-border telecom fraud cases goes to show that Beijing’s single-handed efforts to curb such crime so far is ineffective and that both sides of the Taiwan Strait should work together to seek solutions … and completely crack down [on] fraud rings,” the council said.<br />Questions<br />1.Do you agree the Taiwanese fraud suspects deporting to China? Why?<br />2.Have you ever gotten the fraud calls? Does any friend be cheated?<br />3.Why Taiwan is notorious for fraud?<br />4.How can we decrease the telecom fraud crime?<br /><br />Philippines to temporarily close popular tourist island Boracay(長灘島)<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-43650627">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-43650627</a><!-- m --><br />The Philippine island of Boracay will be closed to tourists for six months following concerns of damage to its once pristine shores. <br />A spokesperson for President Rodrigo Duterte said the closure would begin on 26 April. <br />Earlier this year Mr Duterte said Boracay was turning into a &quot;cesspool&quot; and threatened to shut it down.<br />The island, known for its white-sand beaches, attracted nearly 2 million visitors last year. <br />The decision has prompted concern for the thousands of people employed in Boracay's busy tourist trade. <br />The island is home to around 500 tourism-related businesses, which drew in annual revenue of $1.07bn (£760m) last year. The government said affected companies will receive financial aid. <br />It's not clear how the shutdown will be implemented, though the department of trade and industry had earlier proposed closing the island down in phases, saying a total shutdown would be detrimental to businesses and livelihoods.<br />Damage fears <br />The move follows growing concern over the island's environmental health. <br />Officials had warned businesses had been releasing wastewater into the surrounding waters. <br />In February, Mr Duterte condemned the island's hotels, restaurants and other tourist businesses, accusing them of dumping sewage directly into the sea.<br />&quot;I will charge you for serious neglect of duty [for] making Boracay a fishpond or a sewer pool,&quot; Mr Duterte said at the time. <br />&quot;Either [you] clean it up or I will close it permanently. There will be a time that no more foreigners will go there.&quot;<br />Question<br />1.What is your opinion to see this policy? Do you agree it? Do you have another way to solve this problem?<br />2.Have you ever been disadvantage when traveling?<br />3.There are many tour attractions in Taiwan getting dirty, huge of people and high price, how can we balance quality of traveling and environments?<br />4.Japan is going to add tax, called ‘tourist tax’. Do you agree the policy ‘’tourist tax’’ happeneing in Taiwan?<br /><br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=872">Shuman</a> — Sun Apr 08, 2018 3:59 pm</p><hr />
