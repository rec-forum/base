Do you believe somewhere in the Philippines hidden Yamashita's treasure of World War II? Why or why not?<br />2.	A Philippino treasure hunter Rogelio Roxas found some part of Yamashita's treasure by unwavering perseverance. From his story what lessons do you learn?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Session II (Part 2): Thai treasure cove a hoax: officals</span><br /><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/southeast/04/17/thailand.treasure/index.html" class="postlink">https://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/southeast/04/17/thailand.treasure/index.html</a><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Chaowarin may have been the victim of a big hoax </span><br />April 17, 2001<br /><br />BANGKOK, Thailand -- Thai treasure hunters are losing hope that their hunt for a fabled hoard of Japanese World War II-era booty will end happily for them.<br /><br />Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has called for a halt to digging at a cave near the border with Myanmar, where the treasure was supposed to be hidden.<br /><br />He's hoping that a satellite owned by friends in the U.S. can detect whether the treasure exists when it passes over the site later this week.<br /><br />Thailand has been in the grip of gold fever since senator Chaowarin Latthasaksiri said the Japanese Imperial Army had stashed 2,500 tonnes of booty in a train that was hidden inside the cave.<br /><br />Politicians say the hoard would have been enough to pay off Thailand's US $61 billion national debt.<br /><br />The Prime Minister took the story seriously enough to fly to the site by helicopter last Friday.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Certainly almost fake</span><br />However, officials now say the booty, which are made up of U.S. government bonds are almost certainly fake.<br /><br />For one thing, they are said to have a face value of $100 million each, and the United States has never issued bonds of this size.<br /><br />Thaksin's mood has also changed; he's now telling reporters that Chaovarin may have been the victim of a giant hoax.<br /><br />&quot;It is possible that somebody might have left the bonds at the cave and made him believe they were real bonds,&quot; he said.<br /><br />Former deputy education minister Chaovarin has also admitted he may have been the victim of an elaborate hoax.<br /><br />&quot;I don't know what is actually inside the cave since I have never been in there,&quot; he said, adding it was possible there was no treasure inside.<br /><br />An elderly monk claims he saw the hoard when he went into the cave to meditate years ago.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Recalling the Philippine scam</span><br />Thai newspapers said the mystery appeared to have similarities to a scam foiled this year in the Philippines.<br /><br />Fraudsters there had been trying to sell trillions of dollars of fake U.S. bonds, which they claimed had been discovered in the wreckage of a crashed World War Two bomber found in a remote jungle.<br /><br />The gang had produced the bonds -- which had absurdly high denominations, like the bonds allegedly found in Thailand -- using computers and desktop printers.<br /><br />Thailand is rich with stories about how the departing Japanese army left large amounts of gold and money as it retreated from the region in 1945.<br /><br />The fables are proving to be more convincing than fact for senator Chaovarin,<br /><br />&quot;If there is no treasure in this cave, I will search in others if I am informed of them,&quot; he said.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions (Part 2)</span><br />3.	After you read this article, do you still firmly believe &quot;Yamashita's treasure&quot; hidden in somewhere in South-east Asia nations?<br />4.	How to be a successful treasure hunter? What character is the most important?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Agenda:</span><br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />8:10 ~ 8:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:25 ~ 8:30pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:30 ~9:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~9:30pm Concluding remarks/feedback from newcomers<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The meeting place of Thursday:</span><br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第一區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
