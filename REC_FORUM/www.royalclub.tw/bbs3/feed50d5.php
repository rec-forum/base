Session one<br /><br />A recent dispute between Seven-Eleven Japan Co. and one of its franchise stores has brought the convenience store industry’s around-the-clock service into the spotlight amid a severe nationwide labor crunch.<br /><br />The convenience store industry has become a key player in the Japanese retail sector and more than 90 percent of the over 55,000 stores in the country are open around the clock. The 24-hour service is primarily aimed at meeting demand from customers at night, but convenience store chains also stress their stores’ role as part of social infrastructure, including helping prevent nighttime crime and supplying goods in the event of disasters. The merits of the around-the-clock service, the chains say, also include the use of the quieter late-night hours to check products and clean up.<br /><br />In some cases, convenience store chains allow for exceptions to the 24-hour service standard. Lawson has allowed some of its franchise stores to close late at night, while Family Mart is testing shorter operating hours in Kyoto.<br /><br />Convenience store chains are apparently concerned that if permission to close late at night is given too readily, they will face a rush of such requests from stores. But if the plight of shops goes unaddressed, convenience store chains will face the risk of losing more part-time workers and even store owners, hurting their ability to maintain store networks and the bottom line.<br /><br />*Reference<br />Japan's 24-hour convenience stores struggle to keep doors open all night due to labor crunch<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/02/27/business/corporate-business/japans-24-hour-convenience-stores-struggle-keep-doors-open-night-due-labor-crunch/#.XSMAF-szbX4">https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/ ...

The 7-Eleven chain has grown since the 1970s as its 24-hour accessibility proved a perfect match with densely populated Japan and its late-night work culture. People enjoy the benefit for a long time. Do you think it is a good idea that 7-eleven abandon its 24-hour store policy in the near future? What will be the impact?<br />Q2. Facing labor shortages 7-Elevens, Family Marts in Japan seek Taiwanese employees. Do you think it is a good chance that Taiwanese job seekers with an interest in Japan or the Japanese language to apply for the visa at a convenience store in Japan?<br />Q3. Will you look down on yourself to work in the convenience store as a full time job?<br /><br />************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************<br />Session two<br /><br />Japan passes controversial new immigration bill to attract foreign workers in the end of 2018. The new policy recognizes that the Japanese economy faces severe labor shortages in a wide range of industries and marginally loosens the requirements for a specific set of workers, in an otherwise extremely strict immigration regime.<br /><br />*Reference<br />Japan passes controversial new immigration bill to attract foreign workers<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/japan-passes-controversial-new-immigration-bill-to-attract-foreign-workers/2018/12/07/a76d8420-f9f3-11e8-863a-8972120646e0_story.html?utm_term=.82b926c2cea6">https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/ja ... b926c2cea6</a><!-- m --><br />Japan and the immigration issue<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2004/09/14/issues/japan-and-the-immigration-issue/#.XSMA_eszbX4">https://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/ ...

The program is supposed to bring in workers from other Asian countries to gain skills in Japan. Will it end up that workers are paid little, work incredibly long hours, and get little or no training? In order to reduce creating an “immigration problem, do you think Japan has responsibility creating a social and legal framework that allows for the successful long-term integration of immigrants into society? <br />Q3. Japan is not ready or willing to accept an immigrant influx. Do you think what make Japan has very old, deeply rooted national cultures unlike immigrant-based societies?<br /><br />Suggested Agenda<br />7:00 p.m. --7:30 p.m. free talk <br />7:30 p.m. --8:10 p.m. first topic discussion <br />8:10 p.m. --8:20 p.m. Presentation <br />8:20 p.m.-- 8:40 p.m. Sharing time : articles &amp; other experiences. <br />8:40 p.m.-- 9.:15 p.m. second topic discussion <br />9:15 p.m.-- 9:30 p.m. Presentation<br />speaker time : 2 minutes for each speaker<br />host time : 3 minutes<br /><br />The meeting place of Thursday:<br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第三區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=13721">morris</a> — Fri Jul 05, 2019 3:15 pm</p><hr />
