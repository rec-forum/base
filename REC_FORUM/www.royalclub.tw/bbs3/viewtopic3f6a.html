Many young people now think that marriage costs a lot of money and energy, while cohabitation costs them nothing. Still, some consider cohabitation as a trial when some think it as cheating? Any thoughts about that? <br />5.	As Socrates Quotes. “By all means, marry. If you get a good wife, you'll become happy; if you get a bad one, you'll become a philosopher”. What’s your interpretation about it?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Session 2: Nomophobia</span><br /><br />Please find the video below,<br /><a href="http://www.fox5ny.com/279053126-video" class="postlink">http://www.fox5ny.com/279053126-video</a><br /><br />Here are some tips for you to see if you have nomophobia?<br />• You never turn your phone off<br />• You obsessively check for texts, missed calls and emails<br />• You always take your phone to the bathroom with you<br />• You never let the battery run out<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />1.

Let’s put ourselves in a scenario: If you’re a boss leading a company, but you’ve been wondering that your employees are busy for their work or texting their friends? Be honest and put yourself in the boss’s shoes, would you just directly ban them from using social media at office, or Sneaked behind them and see what’s going on?
