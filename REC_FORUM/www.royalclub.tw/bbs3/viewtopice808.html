Both have fenced for their Ivy League schools’ teams, even facing off against each other to break ties in decisive matches.<br /><br />But this time, brothers Jason and Jerry Chang of California’s San Francisco Bay Area are part of a team representing the United States, competing in the Taipei 2017 Summer Universiade, which officially kicked off in Taiwan’s capital on Aug. 19.<br /><br /> “Definitely when I landed it felt really special because I’ve always come here just for the purposes of visiting family,” Jason Chang, 24, told NBC News during a sit-down interview at the athletes village. “For once I’m here as an athlete representing my country, the United States.”<br /><br />The Changs, whose father grew up fencing in Taiwan, are among the thousands of athletes from around the world taking part in the 29th Summer Universiade, a competition organized by the International University Sports Federation (FISU) whose history dates backs decades.<br /><br />The opening ceremony took place Saturday night in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, before what officials said was a sold-out crowd. But some athletes were blocked from entering and marching in the parade of nations, following what FISU in a statement called “a peaceful public order incident.”<br /><br />Local Chinese-language media reported that groups, including one protesting pension reform in Taiwan, tussled with police on the streets outside the arena.<br /><br />“Following a short wait and quick action from the Taipei authorities, the delayed athletes were able to join those already in the stadium,” the FISU statement reads. “The athletes marched in together to huge applause, and the ceremony continued as planned.”<br /><br />At a Taipei City Hall press conference Sunday afternoon, Mayor Ko Wen-je — speaking in Mandarin — criticized the protesters.<br /><br />“This is a very important event to our nation,” he said through a translator. “And it’s quite impossible to imagine that such kind of intentional disruption did happen.”<br /><br />A total of 119 countries were slated to compete in this year’s Universiade, which runs through Aug. 30, FISU officials said at a press conference Saturday. The event often attracts a variety of athletes, including Olympic aspirants and Olympians themselves.<br /><br />Held every two years in different cities, the Universiade is a long-awaited moment for this democratically self-ruled island of 23 million off the coast of China.<br /><br />For one thing, it’s the biggest sporting event ever hosted here, city officials say. For another, it gives Taiwan a spot on the international stage.<br /><br />Taiwan has grown diplomatically isolated since losing its U.N. seat to China in 1971. The Nationalists and Communists split in 1949 amid the Chinese Civil War, with the Nationalists bringing its government, the Republic of China, to Taiwan. The Communists established the People’s Republic of China on the mainland.<br /><br />China views Taiwan as a breakaway province that must someday be reunited.<br /><br />Relations between the two have become increasingly strained following the 2016 election of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, a member of the Democratic Progressive Party, which has historically favored independence from China.<br /><br />Those tensions bubbled up in the weeks and months leading up to the Universiade.<br /><br />China did not send teams to the event, because of what it said was a scheduling conflict with its own games, though individual athletes have signed up to compete, according to Bloomberg.<br /><br />Ko, Taipei’s mayor, rebuffed a Chinese official’s earlier request for Tsai not to attend the opening ceremony and to be called “leader” rather than “president,” the Taiwan-based China Post reported.<br /><br />And recent mention of Taiwan’s geographic name in an earlier online English-language version of the Universiade media guide as “Chinese Taipei” — an appellation required when it competes in sporting events like the Olympics — stirred anger among many on the island.<br /><br />According to FISU, a member of the Olympic Movement, Taiwan as a host is designated as Chinese Taipei and has its own special flag and anthem.<br />Q1. Do you think it is worth it to hold the Summer Universiade in Taipei?<br />Q2. Which,if any, events of the Taipei Universiade have you watched live at a stadium? Share your experience. Or you just watch them on TV, which Taiwanese athletes’ performance would you like to compliment?  <br />Q3. Which part of the opening ceremony interests you most?<br />Q4. Who should take responsibility that most of athletes were blocked from entering and marching in the parade of nations in opening ceremony?<br />Q5.What do you think of Mayor Ko's handling of the Universiade. Do you think Mayor Ko's handling of the Universiade will benefit him or hurt him politically?<br />Session II<br />Loneliness is becoming a big danger to health <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.breakingnewsenglish.com/1708/170808-loneliness.html">http://www.breakingnewsenglish.com/1708 ... iness.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />New research suggests that loneliness and social isolation may increase the risk of dying early by 50 per cent. The research is from Brigham Young University in the USA. Researchers tried to find out how loneliness affected the risk of early death. They said loneliness can occur even if people are surrounded by family and friends. Researchers also looked at the dangers to health of social isolation. This is when people have little or no contact with others. The research showed that the risk of premature death was 50 per cent lower for adults who mixed with friends and family. Researchers found that loneliness, social isolation, and living alone were all associated with an increased risk of early death.<br />The researchers added that loneliness, social isolation, and living alone could be more dangerous than obesity. Professor Julianne Holt-Lunstad said the results of her research are worrying because the population is aging. She said: &quot;Many nations around the world now suggest we are facing a 'loneliness epidemic'. The challenge we face now is what can be done about it.&quot; She suggested that one way to help with this problem is to teach social skills to children in schools. She also said doctors should talk more about loneliness to their patients. In addition, she said people should prepare for their old age social life like they take out pensions to prepare for their financial future.<br />Q1. How lonely do you get? <br />Q2. How would loneliness affect you? <br />Q3. What do you do when you get lonely?<br />Q4. How does the Internet make people lonelier?<br />Q5. Will we become lonelier in the future? <br />Q6. How could people prepare for their old-age social life?<br />Agenda<br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:05pm discussion session (35 mins)<br />8:05 ~ 8:20pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:20 ~ 8:25pm Regrouping <br />(Session II)<br />8:25 ~ 8:35pm Taking a 10 minutes break (Intermission)<br />8:35 ~ 9:10pm discussion session (35 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~ 9:30pm Concluding remarks/feedback from newcomers<br /><br />The meeting place of Thursday:<br />摩斯漢堡明曜店 (明曜百貨後面第二條巷子地下室)<br />台北市大安區仁愛路四段151巷37號B1樓<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運 - 板南線 - 忠孝敦化站 (步行約5分鐘)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
