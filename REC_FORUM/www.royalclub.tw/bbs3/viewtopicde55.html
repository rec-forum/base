Gates sized up the enormous challenge: reducing the 51 billion tons of f greenhouse gases emitted every year on average to zero by 2050 to avoid a crisis.<br /><br />E2:<br />The European Union, England, France and Sweden have included a net-zero timetables in their laws, while Japan and South Korea announced a goal of net-zero by 2050 and China a target of carbon neutrality by 2060. Japan has also proposed a “Green Growth Strategy” to create a second growth curve.<br /><br />Three things happened last year that transformed the net-zero carbon challenge from a seemingly academic exercise into a live-fire war.<br /><br />First, in March 2020 the European Parliament adopted a resolution in support of an EU carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) that would impose carbon tariffs on products imported from “less climate-ambitious countries,” to be implemented as early as 2023.<br /><br />Second, in July 2020, TSMC signed a 20-year corporate power purchase agreement with Orsted to buy power from the offshore wind farm project the Danish company is developing off the coast of Changhua County. The move shocked people into realizing that zero-carbon was more than just talk – it was a real dollars and cents proposition.<br /><br />Third, in November 2020, Biden was elected president, and since then, climate change has been a common theme in any diplomatic discourse by Biden or Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Lin said.<br /><br />E3:<br />According to Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a coalition of private investors founded by Gates that invests in innovative low-carbon startups around the globe, the main sources of these emissions are manufacturing (31 percent), electricity generation (27 percent), agriculture (19 percent), transportation (16 percent), and buildings (7 percent).<br />In Taiwan, because more than 80 percent of the country’s electricity is generated from fossil fuels and its livestock industry is relatively small-scale, the ratio is quite a bit different: 55 percent of greenhouse gas emissions come from electricity, 25 percent from manufacturing, and 17 percent from transportation.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #FF0000">REF: Questions</span></span></span><br />Q1:<br />Do you think Bill Gates’ advocacy will be accepted and implemented by the majority of countries in the world? If so, can you think of a game rule to distribute the obligation on carbon emission reducing imposed to countries in the world?<br /><br />Q2:<br />From above-mentioned policies on zero carbon emissions taken by power countries such as European Union, England, France, Sweden, China, Japan and South Korea in the world and essential events last year, do you believe that there will be more and more pressure imposed to public sectors, private sectors and even gradually influence to our daily life? How things are going to be? Will you accept an increased living cost likely raised by carbon emissions reduction or clean energy?<br /><br />Q3:<br />Taiwan has been underway to boost renewable energy to 20% by 2025. Are you optimistic on this national goal? Aside from those on-going infrastructures on green energy such as solar power, wind power projects initiated by supply side of implementation for clean energy, how about ideas for carbon reduction on demand side? Will it be feasible to work out policies on carbon reducing through market mechanisms? Will it be likely to impose a domestic carbon tax on manufacturers or even on merchandises in Taiwan, for example?<br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">Session two: Is a Carbon Border Tax fair?</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">REF: Source</span></span><br />S1: What is a Carbon Border Tax and How Fair is it?<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://earth.org/what-is-a-carbon-border-tax/">https://earth.org/what-is-a-carbon-border-tax/</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">REF: Excerpt</span></span><br />E1:<br />A carbon border tax is a tax on carbon emissions attributed to imported goods that have not been carbon-taxed at source. In pushing through policies that result in EU manufacturers relying on environmentally friendlier but more expensive renewable energy, the manufacturers would be at a cost disadvantage compared with overseas competitors that are still using carbon dioxide-producing but cheaper power sources.<br /><br />EU climate commissioner Frans Timmermans therefore announced that the EU would consider the implementation of a carbon border tax to protect European companies from non-European competitors where climate change regulations are less strict. The carbon border tax proposal is part of the European Commission’s European Green Deal that endeavours to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050.<br /><br />E2:<br />A carbon border tax is arguably an improvement from a national carbon tax. A national carbon tax is a fee that a government imposes on any company within the country that burns fossil fuels. However, this often results in an increase of electricity costs in households and industry, which may lead to local business closures and other economic hardships for businesses and citizens.<br /><br />E3:<br />Regarding the EU’s proposal, Beijing said, “We need to prevent unilateralism and protectionism from hurting global growth expectations and the will of countries to combat climate change together.” In other words, China claims that the new tax will discourage the global will to tackle climate change together, as the tax would unfairly obstruct the growth of certain countries’ economies, with one of the most notable effects being on China’s economy.<br /><br />Beijing also raised another interesting point, saying that the new tax would violate the core principle of the Paris accord, which is that richer countries should bear greater responsibility for cutting emissions. This raises an interesting question- is it unfair to expect developing countries to pay the same price as developed countries?<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">REF: Questions</span></span><br />Q1:<br />Do you believe that a carbon border tax is an improvement from a national carbon tax? In March 2020 the European Parliament adopted a resolution in support of an EU carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) that would impose carbon tariffs on products imported from “less climate-ambitious countries,”. Will it be a successful strategy for EU? What will be the likely attitudes or reactions from other power countries such as USA, China, and Japan?<br /><br />Q2:<br />Do you think that imposing a carbon border tax to all states in the world without dividing into developed, developing, and under-developed countries is fair? Why or why not? What can be done to create an impartial game to be complied by countries globally?<br /><br />Q3:<br />Once EU imposes carbon border tariffs on its customs, what will impact Taiwan, a country heavily reliant on export business? Can Taiwan get adaptive on the trend?<br />How things are going to impact the industries in Taiwan and compete against other export orientation countries in the world?<br /><br /><br /><br />P.S.<br />1.因疫情關係，聚會方式改為線上遠距。<br />2.參加三次後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />3.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~</div>
