				<div class="content">United Breaks Guitars: The Power of One Voice in the Age of Social Media<br /><br />Songwriter Dave Carroll wasn’t the first person abused by an airline’s customer service. But he was the first to show how one person, armed with creativity, some friends, $150, and the Internet, could turn an entire industry upside down. United Airlines had broken Dave’s guitar in checked luggage. After eight months of pestering the company for compensation, he turned to his best tool—songwriting—and vowed to create a YouTube video about the incident that he hoped would garner a million views in one year. Four days after its launching, the first million people had watched “United Breaks Guitars.” United stock went down 10 percent, shedding $180 million in value; Dave appeared on outlets as diverse as CNN and The View. United relented. And throughout the business world, people began to realize that “efficient” but inhuman customer-service policies had an unseen cost—brand destruction by frustrated, creative, and socially connected customers. “United Breaks Guitars” has become a textbook example of the new relationship between companies and their customers, and has demonstrated the power of one voice in the age of social media. It has become a benchmark in the customer-service and music industries, as well as branding and social-media circles. Today, more than 150 million people are familiar with this story. In this book, you’ll hear about how Dave developed the “just do it” philosophy that made him the ideal man to take on a big corporation, what it felt like to be in the center of the media frenzy, and how he’s taken his talents and become a sought-after songwriter and public speaker. And businesspeople will learn how companies should change their policies and address social-media uprisings. Since “United Breaks Guitars” emerged, nothing is the same—for consumers, for musicians, or for business. Whether you are a guitarist, a baggage handler, or a boardroom executive, this book will entertain you and remind you that we are all connected, that each of us matters, and that we all have a voice worth hearing.<br /><br />Discussion:<br />1.	With just a song, it made United Airlines loose up 180 M dollars in share price. Is Dave a legend?<br />2.	Falling share price isn’t the same as losing money. Will it affect United Airlines if they don’t offer any compensation?<br />3.	If you were the CEO of United Airlines, how would you cope with the claim?<br />4.	Did you have any experiences to lose your luggage when taking the flights?<br />5.	When taking airplanes, which one you will consider first - cheaper tickets or good reputation with higher price?<br /> Managing Your Anxiety<br />1.  Manage your general anxiety. You can go a long way in managing your anxiety about flying by being mindful about managing your anxiety in general.[6] First, recognize your anxiety. How do you start to feel anxious? Do your palms sweat? Do your fingers tingle? By recognizing what signs you feel first, you will be able to start management exercises earlier to control your feelings of anxiety. <br /> <br />2. Let go of what you can’t control. Many people who are scared of flying are scared because they feel that they are not in control. People with this phobia might feel like they will never get into a car accident because they are in control. They are in the driver's seat. This is why they can accept the risk of driving in a car over flying. Someone else is doing the driving, up in the sky, so the lack of control is often one of the scariest things about flying. Many people experience anxiety because of perceived control (or lack thereof) over a stressful situation. <br /> <br />3. Try relaxing exercises to relieve anxiety. Integrate anxiety-reducing exercises into your everyday life. When you practice these exercises when you are not anxious, you will have tools ready to help you when you are anxious. Then you will feel more able to gain control and calm yourself. Try yoga or meditation to reduce anxiety in your life. It is important to remember that your fear and anxiety can take several months to overcome and gain complete control.<br />4.  Try relaxing your muscles. Start with noticing what muscle group is tight or stiff. Shoulders are a good example. Often when we are nervous or anxious, we move our shoulders up toward our neck and tighten those muscles. Take a deep breath and let your shoulders sink. Feel the muscles relax. Now try this with other muscle groups such as your face or your legs.<br /> <br />5. Use guided imagery. Think of a place that makes you happy or comfortable. Imagine you are in that place. What do you see? Smell? Feel? Focus on each detail about the place you choose. There are several guided imagery tapes that you can purchase or even download to help you practice.<br />6. Take deep breaths. Place one hand on your abdomen. Take in a deep breath through your nose. Take in all the air you can. You should feel our abdomen rise, not your chest. Exhale through your mouth, counting to 10 slowly. Contract your abdomen to push out all the air. Do this exercise 4-5 times to help you relax. Keep in mind that breathing exercises may not provide adequate relief. Several recent research studies found no measurable benefit. <br /> <br />7. Distract yourself. Think about something else you're excited about, or at least something that will take your mind off of your fears. What will you make for dinner? If you could go anywhere, where would you go? What would you do there? <br /> <br />8. Take a class. There are classes that can help you overcome your fear of flying. You may need to pay for one of these courses, but they do exist. There are two kinds of courses: those you attend in person and those you do at your own pace using videos, written materials and counseling sessions. Classes you attend help you get accustomed to flying by exposure to an airport and a flight with your class leader. The desensitization gained by taking this flight may not last, however, unless you maintain it by flying frequently.<br />•	You can look into such group therapy classes in your area. Classes done at your own pace leave you in control of the process. And, since you retain the course materials, you can reinforce your learning by going through the materials periodically.<br />•	Some courses offer weekly group phone counseling sessions at no additional cost.<br />•	Some classes put you in a flight simulator. This mimics the experience of flying without leaving the ground.<br />9.Take flying lessons. Face your fear head-on by taking flying lessons. There are countless stories of people who've feared something all their lives only to meet it face-to-face one day. Then they discover that the object of their fear was nothing to be afraid of. One way to conquer a phobia is to immerse yourself in what you know is a safe situation. In this case, you’re in the presence of a trained professional. With the guidance of a patient instructor, you might find that flying isn't so scary after all. Though this is an extreme approach, it could be your way to easing your anxiety.<br />10.Avoid reading too much about plane crashes. If you want to stay calm on the subject, don’t obsess over plane crashes that are reported in the news. These stories will not make you feel better. Instead they will only add to your anxiety about an unlikely event occurring. If you are already are struggling with anxiety about flying, avoid the temptation to indulge your fears. The same goes for watching Flight or other movies about plane crashes or scary flights.<br />Discussions:<br />1.	Are you afraid of flying? Do you know that the chances of the plane crash is 1 in 60 million?<br />2.	No matter how good you are driving, your odds of accident in a car won’t lower than that of in the plane. Do you agree with it?                                                   <br />3.	When it comes to travelling in the plane, how do you relax to get rid of fear? <br />4.	Can you sleep while taking the long airplane trip? If you cannot, how do you kill your time?  <br />Agenda<br />7:00 p.m. --7:30 p.m. free talk <br />7:30 p.m. --8:10 p.m. first topic discussion <br />8:10 p.m. --8:20 p.m. Presentation <br />8:20 p.m.-- 8:40 p.m. Sharing time : articles &amp; other experiences. <br />8:40 p.m.-- 9.:15 p.m. second topic discussion <br />9:15 p.m.-- 9:30 p.m. Presentation<br />speaker time : 2 minutes for each speaker<br />host time : 3 minutes<br /><br />The meeting place of Thursday:<br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第一區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
