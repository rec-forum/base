Family history, lineage, heritage, and ethnicities, geographic divides, climates, social and political situations, such as poverty and wars majorly influence the food culture. The food culture is influenced by individuals or small networks and institutions, such as families, or large ones, such as societies, companies, and countries.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Different Food Cultures</span><br />Some of the more popular <span style="font-weight: bold">food cultures around the world</span> are:<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Asian food cultures:</span> Rice is a staple in Asian food culture. Hence, it is a quintessential part of the cuisine and can be found in all forms of food.<br />•	<span style="font-weight: bold">Chinese </span>- Stir-fried veggies and meat and a range of meats cooked with different sauces and rice is a staple. Different regions in China, such as the Hunan, Fujian, Sichuan, and Cantonese have a different take on the same dish found throughout the country.<br />•	<span style="font-weight: bold">Thai </span>- the world-famous Thai green, red, and yellow curries have made their place in the hearts of the population around the world. Their strong, spiced flavors and generous use of basil, kafir lime, lemongrass, chilies, coconut milk, mint, cilantro, and turmeric add a pop of flavor to their cuisine. Their rice noodles are equally famous.<br />•	<span style="font-weight: bold">Japanese</span> - Sushis and Sashimis are Japan's gift to the world. Healthy, bite-sized rice-enriched and raw fish pieces work equally well as a quick lunch or a sit-down dinner.<br />•	<span style="font-weight: bold">Indian</span> - The plethora of spices and aromas and a bounty of flavors it lends to any food makes Indian food a favorite amongst other world cuisines. Besides, it's the only cuisine that offers so much variety and flavor when it comes to a strict vegetarian diet. Also, because of the enormity and diversity of the country, the food changes every 500 kilometers. There's a lot more ethnic, regional, and street food in India.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">European food cultures:</span> The Mediterranean diet, known as the healthiest diet there is, has been around for centuries and revels in a diet rich in nuts, olive oil, fresh meat, cold cuts, fruits, and vegetables, not to mention the local wines of various regions and provinces.<br />•	<span style="font-weight: bold">Greek</span> - known for its farm-fresh salads and cheeses, the Greek cuisine is also Mediterranean premier cuisine. Whole grains, cured and marinated meat cooked in spices, and soups are a regular part of Greek cuisine.<br />•	<span style="font-weight: bold">Spanish</span> - the Spanish tapas are nibbles that people enjoy with a glass of wine over a get-together with their friends and family. Being a Mediterranean cuisine, Spanish food has a generous quantity of olive oil, fruits and nuts, Iberian ham, and fresh seafood. Be it the paella or the gazpacho, the world loves the laidback Spanish food culture which has grown to be just an excuse to enjoy the company of friends and family.<br />•	<span style="font-weight: bold">French</span> - French food has led style and elegance to its culture. After all, the Michelin star restaurants were birthed there. Birthdays, weddings, and anniversaries are an excuse to prepare grand meals and get everyone together to enjoy them.<br />•	<span style="font-weight: bold">Italian</span> - known for its simplicity and elegance and yet wholesomeness, the Italian cuisine, whether pizzas or the 500 kinds of pasta, have been adopted as their own by the entire world. There is not a region in the world, where Italian food is not available.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Western food cultures</span><br />•	<span style="font-weight: bold">American </span>- while English and Australian food cultures have their own place, the American food culture has been very dynamic and has changed drastically over the years to accommodate the growing demands of the large immigrant population in the United States. The food culture in the United States is an eclectic mix of all the foods brought in by the immigrants settled here for generations. While hamburgers, fries, and fizzy drinks are quite popular, one cannot negate the presence of Chinese, Indian, Italian, Thai, Spanish, French, Mexican, and South African cuisines. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Relationship between Food and Culture -Why is food important to culture? </span><br />Food is not just something we eat to fill our stomachs. It is consciousness. The love, attention, and toil with which it is shopped for, prepared hours or even days before, cooked with patience, and served with love have a huge impact on how it turns out and how it affects us. People bond over cooking, ingredients, shopping markets, produce, recipes, restaurants, farming, and so much more. Food has been the cornerstone of any food culture around the world. In difficult times, like poverty and war, no matter how little, food has comforted people time and again. What was considered a poor man's food is now famous comfort food dishes around the world. Food recipes passed down from one generation to another have become the identity of families and their lineages. Foods cooked for celebrating rituals, traditions, and occasions have now become a part of rich history. It shapes their identity. It becomes important to the culture. It becomes their culture. The American anthropologist Margaret Mead famously mentioned that food is for gifting. It provides us the basis to connect with our friends and family. It is more than just plain nutrition; food when shared and 'gifted' brings people, societies, and nations closer. The expression 'to break the bread with someone' is more symbolic than literal. It comes from olden times when the bread was often harder than how it is now. As a result, people had to break it rather than just 'tear' it to eat it. While it definitely means sharing a meal with someone, it goes beyond just that. It means sharing an emotional connection, a bond with someone over a meal. Food for centuries, after all, has been bringing people together.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Cultural Heritage</span><br />Food that has been eaten for generations becomes a part of the rich cultural heritage that a region, province, state, or country enjoys. When a country or land is conquered by stronger political powers, so are its traditions, people, and foods. Obviously, the powers bring their own food with them and try to erase or modify the authentic dishes that have been the identity of that place.<br /><br />Discussions:<br />1.

The successful launch of ChatGPT in November has pushed Big Tech, including Google and Microsoft, to accelerate their A.I. research and product rollouts. This week, Google released to testers its own A.I.-assisted search engine called Bard, while Microsoft announced a new version of its own search engine Bing to be powered by a forthcoming large language model similar to ChatGPT and also developed by OpenAI. The technology behind ChatGPT, which enables the chatbot to provide detailed information and write about complex topics, could pave the way for major changes in search engines and in-office apps, and help with everyday tasks. But ChatGPT’s wide range of uses also has people worried about their jobs. The chatbot can write, compose, and problem solve in response to a prompt in a matter of seconds. While it isn’t always accurate, it leaves technical writers, data analysts, and coders nervous about their future.<br />But ChatGPT isn’t yet a risk to our livelihoods, according to Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder and tech investor. “Until now, artificial intelligence could read and write, but could not understand the content,” Gates said in a podcast interview with German business news outlet Handelsblatt. ChatGPT, he said, has shown us what A.I. is capable of, and its effect on the workplace will be extremely positive. “This will change the world,” Gates said. Gates added that while A.I. still makes big mistakes, it could nevertheless enhance office work by improving employee efficiency and productivity. “We find ourselves with a tool that can make even white collar type jobs far more efficient—looking at invoices, medical claims, or, you know, writing letters. Reading and writing are now within A.I.’s capabilities and that will have a very broad impact,” he said.<br /><br /><br />Discussions:<br />1.	ChatGPT is capable of carrying out an intelligent conversation with a human and can input queries like to a friend. What kind of questions you may like to ask ChatGPT?<br />2.	It can generate Email, search engine, write emails, poems and scripts, essays, solve tricky Math problems, create original jokes, writing music, answer questions etc. Do you think it will make our work more efficiently?<br />3.	Are you afraid that it might take our human being’s job in the future and what kind of jobs may be replaced?<br />4.	Do you think ChatGPT is another revolution to our life? Why?<br /><br />P.S.<br />1.參加三次後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />2.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~</div>
