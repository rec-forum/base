6/30(Sat.) RAMADAN &amp; The women who empty their savings to freeze their eggs( Host : Kinny)<br /><br />RAMADAN is observed by Muslims around the world as a period of fasting to commemorate &quot;the best of times&quot;.<br />It celebrates the moment the Koran was unveiled to Muhammad, according to Islamic belief - but what else do we know about the festival which is about to come to an end for 2018.<br />When is Ramadan 2018?<br />Ramadan in 2018 was meant to start on the evening of Tuesday, May 15, and end on the evening of Thursday, June 14.<br />However, the beginning and end are determined by the lunar Islamic calendar – and as the new moon was not sighted in Saudi Arabia on May 15, the start was postponed for another day.<br />This means that the holy month officially began on the evening of Wednesday, May 16.<br />Hilal, the crescent, is usually a day or more after the astronomical new moon.<br />The &quot;night of power&quot; or &quot;night of decree&quot; is considered the holiest night of the year, as Muslims believe the first revelation of the Koran was sent down to Muhammad on this night.<br />It's thought to have occurred on an odd-numbered night during the last 10 days of Ramadan - the 21, 23, 25, 27 or 29th.<br />The holiday of Eid al-Fitr marks the end of Ramadan and the beginning of the next lunar month.<br />This annual observance is regarded as one of the Five Pillars of Islam.<br />A common greeting is Ramadan Mubarak, which means &quot;have a blessed Ramadan&quot;.<br />What happens during Ramadan?<br />The word Ramadan comes from the Arabic root ramiḍa or ar-ramaḍ, which means scorching heat or dryness.<br />Fasting is obligatory for adult Muslims, except those who are suffering from an illness, travelling, are elderly, pregnant, breastfeeding, diabetic, chronically ill or menstruating.<br />The fast is from dawn to sunset, with a pre-dawn meal known as suhur and sunset meal called iftar.<br />Muslims engage in increased prayer and charity during Ramadan.<br />Ramadan is also a month where Muslims try to practice increased self-discipline.<br />As well as fasting - abstaining from eating and drinking during daylight hours - Muslims are encouraged to read the entire Koran throughout the month, before the holy festival of Eid al-Fitr.<br />Why do Muslims fast during Ramadan?<br />Ramadan is seen as a time of spiritual reflection, improvement and increased devotion and worship.<br />Muslims are expected to put more effort into following the teachings of Islam and this includes fasting - which teaches people how to be more self-disciplined and have empathy for those less fortunate.<br />The pre-dawn meal before the fast is called the suhur, while the meal at sunset that breaks the fast is the iftar.<br />In addition to abstaining from eating and drinking, Muslims also increase restraint, such as abstaining from sexual relations.<br />The act of fasting is said to cleanse the soul by freeing it from worldly activities, in addition to the abolition of past sins.<br />The eating of dates usually breaks the fast at sundown.<br />After that, the usual practice is to adjourn for prayer and then the main meal is served.<br /><br />Discussions:<br />1.Have you ever hear/know about Ramadan? Any experiences/news can share with us?<br />2.Do you have any fast experience? How long it take? And what’s the reason for it?<br />3.Have you ever know Muslims? If yes, would you please share some experience/interesting things for us? If not, what do you think about Muslims?<br /> <br /><br />The women who empty their savings to freeze their eggs<br />Growing numbers of healthy young women are freezing their eggs to give them a chance of having children later in life, amassing huge debts in the process. But why?<br />By Anna Louie Sussman, BBC<br />28 June 2018<br /><br />Nastassia, a New York-based restaurateur, was supposed to refrain from doing too much physical activity as she prepared to have her eggs frozen.<br /><br />But despite this, she would regularly cycle the two-mile journey between her Manhattan flat and the Upper West Side fertility clinic for morning ultrasound appointments. The extra stress on her body could possibly have damaged the eggs growing in her ovaries and a ride through New York rush hour by bike is anything but stress-free. Only on the day of the operation itself two years ago did she finally indulge in a cab ride.<br /><br />“I was like, this is going to save me money,” Nastassia explains. She is one of thousands of women each year who decide to have their eggs frozen and stored as an insurance policy for the future. For some, their hope is to preserve their fertility while they look for the right partner or so they can hold off starting a family while they pursue more immediate career goals.<br />The procedure is much like the first half of an in vitro fertilisation (IVF) cycle: stimulation with hormones that causes multiple eggs to develop, then retrieval before they are frozen. Women can then use these frozen eggs sometime down the line for IVF, should they be unable to conceive naturally.<br /><br />But much like other forms of insurance, egg freezing – or oocyte cryopreservation as it is also known – can exert a heavy financial toll on those taking it out. A single cycle can cost up to $17,000 in the US, equivalent to a fifth of the US median household income. In the UK, a cycle can cost between £2,500 and £5,000 – roughly 10% to 20% of a median household’s disposable income.<br /><br />Covering these costs can cause significant financial strain for women, who already earn less and save less than men do. Many women who freeze their eggs decimate their savings, while others are left with significant debt after taking out loans to pay for the procedure or the costly medications.<br /><br />But why are these women prepared to pay such a high price – often at the cost of other goals such as owning a house or financial security – to store eggs they may never need? There are also absolutely no guarantees the frozen eggs will lead to a successful pregnancy even if they do use them.<br />When a handful of large technology companies, such as Apple and Facebook, began offering employees egg freezing as a fertility benefit, critics portrayed the move as a sinister attempt to encourage women to “surrender to corporate control,” putting off human relationships in favour of more hours at their desks. Both these companies have insisted they offered it as a perk in response to demand from their employees and to give them more choice.<br /><br />Some health insurance plans will also cover cryopreservation if it is judged medically necessary, such as before chemotherapy treatment. But the vast majority of women pay for the procedure out of their own savings.<br /><br />Nastassia, now 36, lived frugally throughout her 20s and early 30s so she could save towards a deposit on a home, at one point amassing $30,000 in the bank, some of which she invested in a side business. But at 34, having ended a long-term relationship the previous year, she decided to freeze her eggs, draining $5,000 from her remaining savings in the process. She took out a loan for the rest of the $8,000 in total she needed to cover the cost of the egg retrieval, and put the ovarian stimulation drugs, which cost around $1,000, on her credit card.<br />Four months after freezing her eggs, in December 2016 she got a bonus and a pay rise, enabling her to pay for a second cycle of egg freezing in January 2017, without taking on additional debt.<br /><br />Although now she is earning more than she ever has before, Nastassia is still paying off the loan she took out. She still looks at properties, and even contacts agents, before being nudged back to reality.<br /><br />“There’s still this thing in the back of my mind that I have all that money, because I did at one point,” she says. “But the way dating goes, I know I might not find the right person in two, four, or 100 years. (The age of) 34 seemed to be the cut-off of when fertility doctors advise to freeze eggs, so it was a no-brainer. I had to do what I needed to do.”<br /><br />The number of women freezing their eggs has risen sharply in recent years. There were just 564 egg-freezing cycles performed in the US during 2009, while in 2016 this number had rocketed to 8,892, according to the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology. In the UK, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority recorded around 1,170 egg-freezing cycles performed in 2016, up from 395 in 2012.<br /><br />The increase can be partially explained in 2012, when the American Society for Reproductive Medicine lifted the “experimental” designation after advances in freezing technology led to eggs getting a much better chance of viability after being thawed. Media coverage of technology companies offering egg freezing as an employee benefit and celebrities talking about their own frozen eggs raised awareness of the option. As did companies like EggBanxx, a financial services firm offering loans for egg freezing, which drew attention for holding egg-freezing “parties”.<br /><br />Research into this sort of “social egg freezing” suggests women are perhaps taking this costly gamble due to factors that go deeper than simply wanting to focus on their careers. Unpublished research by Yale University anthropologist Marcia Inhorn found 90% of the 150 American women she interviewed as part of a study on egg freezing cited an ongoing search for a partner as their main reason for choosing the procedure. Zeynep Gurtin, a visiting researcher with the University of Cambridge, has claimed there is a similar phenomenon in the UK.<br /><br />But what does this mean for women’s finances? Women already earn less than men in nearly all sectors of the economy, and they also own fewer assets such pensions and property. In the US, women hold just 32 cents for every dollar owned by men.<br /><br />While the number of women who have frozen their eggs is likely to be too small to impact national figures, for individual women, the cost is significant.<br /><br />Emma Jane, a freelance events planner in London, makes around £55,000 a year and started looking into egg freezing when she was 37, after not having dated anyone seriously for several years. She researched clinics carefully, and was able to do preliminary tests at a clinic that had an offer for an inexpensive consultation – around £200, she recalls.<br /><br />In November 2017, she retrieved nine eggs at a network of UK clinics known for pioneering mild stimulation techniques, which use fewer drugs and so lowers the cost of the procedure, but also yields fewer eggs. Even so, it still set her back around £5,100 for the procedure, including medication and blood tests.<br />“It is a lot of money,” says Emma Jane. She’s now planning to undergo a second cycle – doctors recommend women have 20 for the best chance of having a live birth. Storing her eggs will also cost Emma Jane an additional £360 annually, which will set her back thousands if she stores them for the UK’s maximum term of ten years. Then there is the cost of IVF itself, which can run to £5,000 or more for private treatment, if she chooses to use them.<br /><br />The costs can become astronomical. Emma Jane compares it to “an insurance policy that could be a waste of money, because I might meet a partner and have kids naturally”.<br /><br />“Even if I met someone tomorrow who was the man of my dreams, it would be a while until we settled down and got married. Then if we chose to have a kid, I’d probably be 40 by then, and if I wanted two kids, I’d probably be in my early 40s.”<br /><br />But what these women are paying for is still just a sliver of hope. The technology is not guaranteed to work, since the majority of IVF cycles end in failure – only a fifth are successful – and there is always the chance that the frozen eggs might not survive the thawing process, or could have chromosomal abnormalities.<br /><br />Helaine Olen, a personal finance writer and author of personal finance book Pound Foolish, questions why so much money is pouring into an industry that still has low success rates. “This is about American women getting sold on a less-than-certain technology as a way of addressing greater sociological issues,” argues Olen.<br /><br />And for most women, they hope they will meet a partner and get pregnant the old-fashioned (and free) way, and therefore never having to use their frozen eggs at all.<br /><br />Tiffany Murray, now 40, froze her eggs when she was 34 after having limited success with dating in Washington, DC. Rather than be pushed into a relationship that wasn’t right by the desire to have children before it was too late, she chose to freeze her eggs. Her parents paid for the procedure as a Christmas gift.<br /><br />Four years later, however, she met her now-husband and they conceived naturally shortly after they were married. She still pays to keep her 14 frozen eggs stored in case they have trouble conceiving a second time; in the six years since she froze, the annual storage fee has risen from $350 to $600.<br /><br />At that price, jokes Murray, it feels a little like her “eggs are being held to ransom”.<br /><br />Despite the high cost of retrieving 30 of her eggs and the $1,000-a-year storage fees, Nastassia insists she made the right choice. She even encourages friends to consider freezing their own eggs. <br /><br />“There’s a little bit of anger surrounding the finances,” she says, but she adds that she does not regret making the investment in her future.<br /><br />“Now I have 30 kids on the Upper West Side that I pay $1,000 a year for,” she adds with a laugh. Or at least she might have, if she ever chooses to cash in her fertility insurance policy.<br /><br />Discussions:<br />1.What do you think about freezing eggs after reading this article?<br />2.Can you share your idea about “What’s the main reason for freezing eggs”?<br />3.If you save some money, will pay for freezing your eggs?
