What impressed you the most? <br />If you are not familiar with Jin Yong’s works, do you have any ideas about Chinese martial arts novels?<br /><br />2.Among all Jin Yong’s works, which one do you prefer? The Legend of the Condor Heroes (射鵰英雄傳), The Return of the Condor Heroes (神鵰俠侶), The Heavenly Sword and Dragon Saber (倚天屠龍記), Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils (天龍八部), The Smiling, Proud Wanderer (笑傲江湖), or The Deer and the Cauldron (鹿鼎記), etc.? Why? <br />If you are not familiar with Jin Yong’s works, would you please share with us why most characters in Chinese martial arts novels are homeless without stable jobs but have no money problems?<br /><br />3.If you could be the male/female character from Jin Yong’s novels, which one would you want to be and which female/male character would you choose to be your lifelong partner? <br />If you are not familiar with Jin Yong’s works, please share with us what fighting technique fascinates you the most, such as Qi (氣功,內力), acupuncture point technique (點穴), lightness technique(輕功) or others?<br /><br /><br /><br />--------------------------------------<br />Session 2. Flight seat arrangements for Taiwanese athletes to the Tokyo Olympics <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4252738">https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4252738</a><!-- m --><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://chinapost.nownews.com/20210721-2659908">https://chinapost.nownews.com/20210721-2659908</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Questions: <br />1.What do you think about this issue in general? In addition, please discuss this issue in terms of respect, promise, expectation and prior communication. <br /><br />2.If you were the organizer of the event, under the condition that charter flights are insufficient, business seats are limited and alternate seating arrangements are required, how would you assign seats to all participants? Athletics with better world ranking? Coaches? Doctors? Team leaders? Two direct superiors? All at the economy class? Follow previous rules?...<br /><br />3.How do you feel that Sports Administration changes its leader 5 times in 4 years? Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee is a civil association which is overseen by its members. Do you have any suggestions for its reform?<br /><br />4.Sports Administration Director-General offered to resign to take responsibility for the incident. Do you think his resignation will trigger sports reform? Do you think that his step-down over this issue meets the principle of proportionality?<br /><br /><br />P.S.<br />1.參加三次後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />2.請帶著開放與熱情來參加全英文會話聚會!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=37037">JuliaHo</a> — Sat Jul 24, 2021 7:27 pm</p><hr />
