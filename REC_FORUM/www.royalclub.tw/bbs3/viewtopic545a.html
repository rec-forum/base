			<div class="content">Host : Joyce<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">1. Why is being scared so fun?</span><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oetVvR5RQUs" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oetVvR5RQUs</a><br /><br />Somewhere right now, people are lining up to scare themselves, maybe with a thrill ride or horror movie. In fact, in October of 2015 alone, about 28 million people visited a haunted house in the U.S. But many consider this behavior perplexing, asking the question, &quot;What could possibly be fun about being scared?&quot;<br /><br />Fear has a bad rap, but it's not all bad. For starters, fear can actually feel pretty good.When a threat triggers our fight or flight response, our bodies prepare for danger by releasing chemicals that change how our brains and bodies function. This automatic response jumpstarts systems that can aid in survival. They do this by making sure we have enough energy and are protected from feeling pain, while shutting down nonessential systems, like critical thought. <br /><br />Feeling pain-free and energized, while not getting caught up in worrisome thoughts that normally occupy our brains, that all sounds great, and it can be because this response is similar, though not exactly the same to what we experience in positive, high-arousal states, like excitement, happiness, and even during sex. The difference lays in the context. If we're in real danger, we're focused on survival, not fun. But when we trigger this high arousal response in a safe place, we can switch over to enjoying the natural high of being scared. It's why people on roller coasters can go from screaming to laughing within moments.Your body is already in a euphoric state. You're just relabeling the experience. <br /><br />And though the threat response is universal, research shows differences between individuals in how the chemicals associated with the threat response work. This explains why some are more prone to thrill-seeking than others. Other normal physical differences explain why some may love the dizziness associated with a loop-de-loop, while loathing the stomach-drop sensation of a steep roller coaster, or why some squeal with delight inside a haunted house, but retreat in terror if taken to an actual cemetery.<br /><br />Fear brings more than just a fun, natural high. Doing things that we're afraid of can give us a nice boost of self-esteem. Like any personal challenge, whether it's running a race or finishing a long book, when we make it through to the end, we feel a sense of accomplishment.This is true even if we know we're not really in any danger. Our thinking brains may know the zombies aren't real, but our bodies tell us otherwise. The fear feels real, so when we make it through alive, the satisfaction and sense of accomplishment also feel real.This is a great evolutionary adaptation. Those who had the right balance of bravery and wit to know when to push through the fear and when to retreat were rewarded with survival, new food, and new lands. <br /><br />Finally, fear can bring people together. Emotions can be contagious, and when you see your friend scream and laugh, you feel compelled to do the same. This is because we make sense of what our friends are experiencing by recreating the experience ourselves. In fact, the parts of the brain that are active when our friend screams are active in us when we watch them. This not only intensifies our own emotional experience, but makes us feel closer to those we're with. The feeling of closeness during times of fear is aided by the hormone oxytocin released during fight or flight. <br /><br />Fear is a powerful emotional experience, and anything that triggers a strong reaction is going to be stored in our memory really well. You don't want to forget what can hurt you. So if your memory of watching a horror film with your friends is positive and left you with a sense of satisfaction, then you'll want to do it over and over again.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />1. Do you like thrill rides, horror movies or anything that will scare you? Why or why not?<br />2. Being scared is so fun! Are you agree with it or not? Why?<br />3. From the perspect of science, why being scared is so fun?<br />4. Sharing your own experience about a scared situation in which you feel happy or satisfied with.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">2. What is WannaCry and how does ransomware work?</span><br /><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/0/ransomware-does-work/" class="postlink">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/0/ransomware-does-work/</a><br /><br />A global cyber attack has been underway since Friday, affecting more than 200,000 organisations in 150 countries. In the UK, the major assault hit 47 NHS trusts, leading to operations being cancelled and patients turned away from A&amp;E.<br />The &quot;WannaCry&quot; ransomware appears to have used a flaw in Microsoft's software, discovered by the National Security Agency and leaked by hackers, to spread rapidly across networks locking away files. <br />A security expert managed to stop the attack by triggering a &quot;kill switch&quot; on Saturday but it has continued to wreak havoc. <br />Ransomware, which demands payment after launching a cyber attack, has become a rising trend among hackers looking for a quick payout. <br />What is ransomware?<br /><br />Ransomware is a kind of cyber attack that involves hackers taking control of a computer system and blocking access to it until a ransom is paid.<br />For cyber criminals to gain access to the system they need to download a type of malicious software onto a device within the network. This is often done by getting a victim to click on a link or download it by mistake.<br />Once the software is on a victim's computer the hackers can launch an attack that locks all files it can find within a network. This tends to be a gradual process with files being encrypted one after another. <br />Large companies with sophisticated security systems are able to spot this occurring and can isolate documents to minimise damage. Individuals might not be so lucky and could end up losing access to all of their information. <br />Cyber criminals often demand payment in return for unlocking the files. This is normally in the form of bitcoin, the online cryptocurrency.<br /><br />What is Wanna Decryptor?<br />Wanna Decryptor, also known as WannaCry or wcry, is a specific ransomware program that locks all the data on a computer system and leaves the user with only two files: instructions on what to do next and the Wanna Decryptor program itself.<br />When the software is opened it tells computer users that their files have been encryted, and gives them a few days to pay up, warning that their files will otherwise be deleted. It demands payment in Bitcoin, gives instructions on how to buy it, and provides a Bitcoin address to send it to.<br /><br />Most computer security companies have ransomware decryption tools that can bypass the software.<br />It was used in a major cyber attack that affected organisations across the world including the NHS and Telefonica in Spain. <br />A young cyber expert managed to stop the spread of the attack by accidentally triggering a &quot;kill switch&quot; when he bought a web domain for less than £10.<br />When the WannaCry program infects a new computer it contacts the web address. It is programmed to terminate itself if it manages to get through. When the 22-year-old researcher bought the domain the ransomware could connect and was therefore stopped. <br /><br />How to protect yourself against ransomware attacks. The best protection against ransomware attacks is to have all files backed up in a completely separate system. This means that if you suffer an attack you won't lost any information to the hackers. <br /><br />It is difficult to prevent determined hackers from launching a ransomware attack, but exercising caution can help. Cyber attackers need to download the malicious software onto a computer, phone or other connected device. The most common ways of installing the virus are through compromised emails and websites. <br /><br />For example, hackers could send an employee a phishing email that looks like it comes from their boss asking them to open a link. But it actually links to a malicious website that surreptitiously downloads the virus onto their computer. <br />Downloading a bad program or app, and visiting a website that is displaying malicious adverts can also result in an infected device. <br />The best way to protect yourself is to be suspicious of unsolicited emails and always type out web addresses yourself rather than clicking on links. Another key defence is antivirus programs that can scan files before they are downloaded, block secret installations and look for malware that may already be on a computer. <br /><br />Cyber security companies have developed sophisticated defences against the cyber attack, including machines that fight back when they spot hackers in a system. <br /><br />What to do if you're a victim - should you pay the ransom? <br />Victims are advised to never pay the ransom as it encourages the attackers. Even if victims do pay there is also no guarantee that all files will be returned to them in tact.<br />Instead, the best thing to do is restore all files from a back up. If this isn't possible, there are some tools that can decrypt and recover some information. <br /><br />How much do hackers demand, and why in Bitcoin?<br />Ransomware often demands between 0.3 and 1 Bitcoins (£400 - 1,375), but can demand a payment denominated in dollars but made via Bitcoin.<br /><br />The digital currency is popular among cybercriminals because it is decentralised, unregulated and practically impossible to trace.<br />Although it may seem like a small amount to charge, the ransomware attacks are often widely distributed, so the ransom payments can stack up.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />1. What is WannaCry, ransomware and Wanna Decryptor? How do thay works?<br />2. Were you affected by the global computer virus? Or did you heard any experience about being attacked by the computer virus?<br />3. What did you do to prevent being attacked by the computer virus?<br />4. If you were attacked by the computer virus, will you pay the ransom or not? Why?</div>
