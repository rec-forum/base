			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Thank You For Not Believing In Me</span><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/17884">https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/17884</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Have you ever had someone not believe in you or they said something really horrible about your work or felt like a punch in the gut and just left you thinking, “Oh my God, how could someone be that mean?” I have. So let me tell you what it did for me and, more importantly, what it could do for you. So back in 2009 my program B-School was getting ready to be brought into the world and I was trying to do everything I could to make it a success. I was trying to network, find promotional partners, basically get the world out all over. So I went to this business conference in Washington DC and I was so excited to be there. I had my little conference badge around my neck, I had my big conference binder under my arm, everything was going good. So I’m on the escalator heading to go up to one of the main sessions and there was this guy in front of me and he was part of the conference too. So, of course, as you do at conferences, he turned around and he asked me. It’s like, “Oh, so what do you do?” This was the perfect opportunity. I was so excited. I started telling him about B-School.<br />   I said, “Oh, I’m launching this incredible online business program for women entrepreneurs.” And so he says, “Oh, that’s cute. Is that a hobby? Do you actually make money doing that? Or do you have a rich husband who is bankrolling you?” For one of the very few times in my life, I was absolutely speechless. I felt like I just got gone by the ultimate business debate. I was thinking to myself, “I cannot believe a-hole like this still exists.” And thank God it was a short little escalator ride because I wanted to throw him over that freaking escalator. I got myself together, I mustered out something about that I had been successfully supporting myself in business for the last 9 years, and then I did whatever I could to get away from that turd muncher as fast as humanly possible. <br /><br />      Now, here’s my point, well that guy was a total ignorato for what he said to me, I actually thank him for not believing in me. I thank him for underestimating me. I thank him for being a totally ignorant chauvinistic piece of poop. You know why? Because he actually fueled me to make B-School even more of a success. I was already committed to it, but after that interaction, nothing was going to stop me. Now, I know that not everybody is wired in the exact same way, but for me when I want some really bad and someone basically says, “You can’t do that,” it just gets me totally fired up and motivated to prove them wrong. And, yes, I know in a certain spiritual framework we don't wanna be reactive to life, but what I’m saying is this, is that every single thing that happens to you, including what I now call escalator moment, are fuel for growth and sometimes even more so than the encouraging moments. And to help you remember this, here’s a Tweetable: “Sometimes a put-down is the best fuel to fire you up.”<br /><br />     So let’s turn this inspiration into action. I would love to hear about your escalator moment. Let’s have a real honest to goodness thank you fest for those people that have not believed in you or for those times when life has challenged your belief in yourself. Tell me how you can take one of those moments and really let it fuel you into what you want to create right now. As always, the best discussions happen after the episode over at, say it with me, the lovely land of MarieForleo.com, so go there and leave a comment now. <br />Question<br />1.	Have you ever had someone not believe in you or insult to you, but you did well more than everyone think finally. Share us your story.<br />2.	Follow the last question. Actually, he/she is another kind of important person. If you have a chance to meet he/she again after you success it. What you want to say? <br />3.	In the other hand, we might able to lose our confident if someone does believe in you, how to deal with this situation?  <br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Does Your School Matter?</span><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/29175?ref=translated">https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/29175?ref=translated</a><!-- m --><br /><br /> We’re all told to work hard in school, so that we can get into the best colleges or universities, and be successful. But, does the school you choose actually matter? Take a look at these SAT scores for an average school - which are out of 800, by the way. Those that have the highest SAT scores end up representing over 50% of the people who get degrees at these schools, while the lowest SAT scores only represent around 18% of the people who actually graduate. Not so surprising. But now let’s look at a top school, like Harvard. Here, the students with the lowest SAT scores, are still smarter than the best students at an average school. And yet, when we look at their rate of completion, it looks awfully similar. The top students represent just over 50% of people who graduate, while the lower SAT scores represent around 15% of people who actually graduate. Wait, what’s going on here? This phenomenon is known as the Big Fish - Little Pond Effect. Simply put, we compare ourselves not globally, but to our neighbors’ or people who are in the same boat as we are. As a result, students at top schools compare themselves to their brilliant peers, and if you’re in the bottom half of your class, you’re likely to have feelings of inadequacy. Even though compared to the rest of the world you are at the top! Who do you think has a higher incidence of suicide? <br /><br />People who live in developed countries that declare themselves as very happy, like Switzerland, Denmark and Canada or those which describe themselves as unhappy, like Italy, Greece, and Spain? The happy countries. If you’re depressed but everyone around you is also unhappy, you may think of yourself as normal, as opposed to being stuck around people who are happier than you. Similarly, if you’re very intelligent at an elite school, you may end up being a little fish in a very big pond. And feeling as though you’re at the bottom impacts your confidence and ultimately your motivation. Need more statistics? 50% of US students in STEM programs drop out in the first or second year of school. But for every 10 point decrease in the school’s average SAT score, degree completion rises by 2%! Meaning, you’re much more likely to even get your degree if you don’t go to your top pick. But who ends up being more successful in the ‘real world’? A study looking at publications produced by economists in their first six years after graduation showed that top students in the 99th percentile - ie smarter than almost every other person at the school - from the top 5 schools in America were producing an impressive amount of publications. But those in the 75th percentile, still the top quarter of best students, are publishing next to nothing. Essentially failures in their field. But if we now look at the best students from the 30 worst schools, we see that they’re publishing more than those in the top quarter of the best schools in the country! Clearly, your surroundings and peers matter. Now, of course, this doesn’t cover every aspect of going to a top ranked school - including the fact that having a degree from one of them can be a badge of honour, and may help you find a job more easily. But, that’s if you ever even graduate. So when you’re applying for school, or even at your new college, keep in mind that whether you go to the best or worst school, the formula for success is mixed. Remember the importance of confidence in your abilities, and how being a Big Fish in a little pond can sometimes be more important than your school itself.<br /><br />Question:<br />1.	Does your school matter? Why? Why not?<br />2.	Have you or your friends ever been to elite school? How different?<br />3.	Do you agree the school will decide your achievement? Why?<br />4.	Do you agree in the higher pressure can grow up quickly?<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
