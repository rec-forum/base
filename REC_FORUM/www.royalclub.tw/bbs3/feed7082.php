What's embarrassed you the most?  <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://youtu.be/K7C77zkORUM">https://youtu.be/K7C77zkORUM</a><!-- m --><br /><br />What's embarrassed you the most? <br /><br />I think everybody did have some awkward moment that you felt so embarrassed, even after a long time we still can remember how hard that we felt at the moment. Can we talk this matter just like a funny thing in your life, absolutely no offense intended to anyone. So, please share something you felt that always unforgettable to you.<br /><br />For instance: my experience <br />Once, I wore a pair of sandals that I hadn't worn in two or three years. When I walked about 2 minutes away, the soles began to fall off. At first, I thought I could use them reluctantly, but then it became more and more serious. They were all taken off, so I had no choice but to take off my shoes and walk on barefoot. Fortunately, there was a supermarket nearby. I went in and bought a quick glue, which stuck to the soles of my shoes. Fortunately, I could barely wear them back. Change my another shoes at home. However, it was very hot that day, and my bare feet were burnt painfully on the asphalt. I can only walk by jumping, which is really embarrassing. I can still remember it vividly until now. <br /><br />Questions:<br />1.Do you still remember the embarrassed event, what caused it happened? What’s the end?<br />2.Have you ever seen someone had happened an embarrassed thing or accident even? Would you give a hand helping them out?<br />3.Do you have any interesting story about embarrassed things that you know of?<br />4.How about what is most proud thing you have done? please share with us.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Section II: Why Are Dogs “Man’s Best Friend”?<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4BvmQmTyCvk&amp;feature=share">https://youtube.com/watch?v=4BvmQmTyCvk&amp;feature=share</a><!-- m --><br /><br />There is a legend that after God created human beings, because human beings reproduced too many, he had no time to take care of all people, so he created a dog and let him be a friend of human beings and accompany them by their side.<br /><br />if you don’t believe, read God in the opposite direction and it becomes dog.<br />Of course, it's just a legend. <br /><br /><br />Questions:<br />1. Do you like dogs, or you don't? please tell us your reason?<br />2. Scientists find that dogs can be used to comfort traumatized people, or Dogs can help detect drugs or landmines, have you ever views on this kind of report?<br />3.
