Especially at lunch or dinner time, food couriers waiting for the traffic lights to change at most intersections provide a display of the various food delivery options available in Taipei.<br /><br />Clearly, this is an emerging industry that no one can ignore.<br /><br />Food delivery is convenient. It allows people to order meals from a wide array of restaurants on their mobile phones, avoiding the inconvenience of eating out or cooking.<br /><br />In addition, these digital platforms allow restaurants to attract new customers, without the need to train and maintain their own delivery staff. For food couriers, barriers to entry in this industry are low, and the “gig” economy offers flexible work schedules and the opportunity to earn money on the side.<br /><br />At first glance, food delivery platforms seem to have created a win-win-win situation for consumers, restaurants and delivery people, and the industry has expanded quickly.<br /><br />However, there have been increasing complaints from couriers and customers. For instance, some food couriers have taken to social media to vent their anger at heavy workloads, poor pay structures, insufficient occupational safety and rude customers.<br /><br />There have been traffic accidents as delivery riders rush to finish a task and move on to collect the next order. There have been incidents, including one last week, in which food couriers were injured or killed in accidents, but they had no accident insurance or other benefits granted to full-time employees. In this respect, the industry does not seem as bright and promising as it might claim.<br /> <br />There are increasing calls to make sure that people working in this industry have the rights and protections they need.<br /><br />One of the major disputes between food couriers and delivery service operators is employment status: Couriers are not regular employees, but independent contractors, which affects their labor and health insurance, as well as other benefits. Service operators like to highlight the beauty of the burgeoning gig economy, in which people can work simultaneously for different employers and with greater flexibility. However, labor rights advocates have called the situation exploitative.<br /><br />Moreover, because the employment relationship is built on a contract basis, service platforms cannot be held responsible for the behavior of couriers if consumers’ rights are not respected. That has led platform operators, restaurants and couriers to pass the buck whenever disputes occur.<br /><br />To date, food couriers in Taiwan have not formed any unions. It remains to be seen if they would form labor unions to negotiate contract terms and seek better working conditions, taking the example of the Japanese staff of Uber Eats, who formed a labor union on Oct. 3.<br /><br />The government cannot turn a blind eye to the hidden risks the development of a gig economy might generate. The government should not take a laissez-faire attitude and allow companies to externalize their true social and labor costs under the guise of business innovation and technology upgrades.<br /><br />Taiwan needs a legal framework to protect those working for these platforms from being treated poorly, and the government should help ensure that companies maintain corporate social responsibility, provide good management and improved employment relations.<br /><br />Q1. Why can delivery service operators expand so quickly?<br />Q2. Have any other emerging gig industries been booming?<br />Q3. Will you order meals from restaurants with delivery by food couriers? Why or why not? <br />Q4. What disputes may occur between food couriers and delivery service operator?<br /><br />Session II:<br />Dear LA: I love you. I hate you.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.eslpod.com/eslpod_blog/2019/08/06/dear-la-i-love-you-i-hate-you/">https://www.eslpod.com/eslpod_blog/2019 ... -hate-you/</a><!-- m --><br />A few blocks from my house, the owner of a very large house recently painted a message to everyone who drives or walks past (see photo). It reads:<br /><br />“Dear LA,<br /><br />I love you. I hate you.<br /><br />I love you. I hate you.<br /><br />I love you.”<br /><br />What does it mean?<br /><br />I haven’t talked to the homeowners (people who own/have a house) who painted this, but I understand what they are saying.<br /><br />When you live in a big city like Los Angeles (or anywhere, really), there are things you love about your city and at least a few things you hate.<br /><br />If you live in a place a long time, you’ll likely love more things than you hate. If you didn’t, you would move to another city.<br /><br />The homeowners says “I love you” three times, and “I hate you” only twice, so I am assuming that they love LA more than hate it.<br /><br />What are the things that I love about LA? What things do I hate? Here’s a quick list:<br /><br />THINGS I LOVE<br />1.Great food from all over the world that doesn’t cost too much.<br />2.A mix of people, languages, and cultures like few other cities in the world.<br />3.The weather.<br />4.Enough artistic and cultural sites to keep me busy and interested (but not as many as New York City, I admit).<br />5.The constant influx (arrival) of new “Angelenos” (someone living in LA) who come to the city to fulfill (get done) their dreams. It brings the city life and hope.<br />6.The weather.<br /><br />THINGS I HATE<br />1.The traffic. There are too many cars (and people) everywhere you go.<br />2.Many people’s sense of entitlement, thinking that the rest of the world owes them something, and they should get it.<br />3.The city government (a disaster, like California’s state government).<br />4.Crime (see #3). It’s much safer in LA now than when I moved here almost 30 years ago, but there are still too many thefts (things stolen) and murders.<br />5.The traffic.<br /><br />So that’s six “loves” and five “hates.” For now, I guess I’ll stay in Los Angeles.<br /><br />What are things that you love and hate about the city where you live?<br /><br />Q1.Compare LA or another foreign city to the city you live in, what are the Pros &amp; Cons?<br />Q2. All other things being equal, would you move to the other city if the “loves” are less than the “hates.”?<br />Q3. Which city you prefer to live in?<br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00 ~ 7:30 pm greetings &amp; free talk<br />7:30 ~ 8:15 pm guests introduced &amp; first session discussion<br />8:15 ~ 8:45 pm presentation, sharing the article &amp; other experiences<br />8:45 ~ 9:30 pm second session discussion<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven,<br />板橋民生路二段237 號,<br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30,<br />a minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文<br /><br />Royal 三峽 , Royal new branch information,<br />Every Monday evening: 8:00pm- 10pm: 摩斯漢堡 北大特區 土城區學成路712號, next to the park.<br />Please keep contact with President Ophelia.</div>
