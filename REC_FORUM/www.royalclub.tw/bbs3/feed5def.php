<span style="font-weight: bold">Session I : Four steps to a younger, smarter brain</span><br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/oct/14/four-steps-to-better-brain-health" class="postlink">https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/oct/14/four-steps-to-better-brain-health</a><br /><br />Evidence suggests memory decline can be slowed and even reversed by adopting a few healthy lifestyle habits<br /><br />Brain health is key to successful ageing, and it involves several mental functions including memory, reasoning and planning. Memory defines who we are – without memory we have no past, cannot plan for the future and are unable to enjoy the present. Our reasoning and planning skills help us create and maintain healthy lifestyle habits that protect our bodies and minds.<br /><br />People are living much longer than ever before. Those born in 1900 would have been lucky to reach their 50th birthday. Today, life expectancy in many countries exceeds 80, but unfortunately age-related diseases such as Alzheimer’s and diabetes can diminish quality of life.<br /><br />As we age, brain cells that normally fight off infection and repair tissue begin to attack healthy brain cells. This causes inflammation and can lead to cognitive deficits and disease. But adopting healthy, anti-inflammatory lifestyle habits, such as eating fish, getting a good night’s sleep and doing physical exercise, can slow and even reverse the process.<br /><br />The typical 45-year-old has worse memory than a 25-year-old, and our brains will continue to decline if we do nothing to protect them. However, if we intervene early, we can slow the decline. It’s always easier to protect a healthy brain than to try to repair damage once it is extensive.<br /><br />Although there is a genetic component to healthy ageing, lifestyle habits may be more critical than genes. The landmark MacArthur Studies of Successful Aging showed that, on average, non-genetic factors are more important than genetics in determining how well and long we live, suggesting that we have more control than we realise over remaining healthy as we get older. Compelling scientific evidence points to a formula for successful ageing, in particular four habits that facilitate ageing well.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Physical activity</span><br />You don’t have to become a triathlete to live better for longer – 20 minutes of daily brisk walking will lower your risk for dementia and improve your overall health. Exercise produces proteins that stimulate brain cells to sprout branches and communicate more effectively. Workouts boost endorphins, which lift mood. Exercise will make your brain bigger, and a bigger brain is a better brain.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Mental exercise</span><br />Playing games, socialising and travelling activate brain cells, and a university education is associated with a lower dementia risk. Although smartphones and new technology often distract us, certain brain games boost multitasking and problem-solving skills, and searching online can activate neural circuits.<br /><br />We can also train our brains using memory methods to compensate for everyday forgetfulness. These methods can help us focus attention and use mental images and associations to make information meaningful and memorable.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Stress management</span><br />Stress shrinks the brain’s memory centres, and the stress hormone cortisol temporarily impairs memory. However, meditation, yoga, tai chi and other relaxation methods can reverse stress and improve mood and memory. Meditation even rewires the brain and improves measures of chromosomes’ telomere (protective cap) length, which predicts longer life expectancy.<br /><br />Spending time with friends and getting a good night’s sleep also reduce stress.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Healthy diet</span><br />Mid-life obesity increases the risk of late-life dementia, but portion control and exercise can help people avoid obesity. Obese people who lose weight experience significant, lasting memory improvements after just 12 weeks. Omega-3 fats from fish or nuts fight inflammation associated with neurodegeneration. Fruit and vegetables combat age-related oxidative stress that causes wear and tear on brain cells.<br /><br />People can protect their brains by avoiding crisps, biscuits and other processed foods that increase the risk of diabetes, which doubles the risk of dementia. Several studies have suggested that alcohol and caffeine in moderation lead to better brain health.<br /><br />It is never too early or too late to start living more healthily. Your daily habits have more impact on how long and how well you live than your genes, and you can take control of your longevity by following the formula for successful ageing: exercise your body, stimulate your mind, manage stress and eat right so you can enjoy yourself as you live better for longer.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion Questions:</span><br />1. Which one is your favor step to keep your brain younger and smarter?<br />2. Any other tips to younger or smarter brain, can you share with us?<br />3. How do you think faster and better?<br />4. What are some habits that are good to brain?<br />5. How do you manage stress?<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Session II : Life before Google: What was it like?</span><br /><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-44871028" class="postlink">https://www.bbc.com/news/world-44871028</a><br /><br />Is it OK to turn my cat vegan? What's that fresh smell that babies have? What is love?*<br /><br />In the 20 years since it was founded, Google has provided answers to the most random queries, become a verb and, on Wednesday, received a record $5bn fine after giving itself a bit too much of an edge over its rivals.<br /><br />Some jobs with an emphasis on research have been altered in major ways by its invention, to the extent that it's hard to imagine how those jobs were once done.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The journalist</span><br />Gareth Hughes was a reporter with the Daily Post newspaper in North Wales from 1974 to 2006 (and is the father of the author of this article).<br /><br />&quot;I had to write about such a range of things that nobody ever expected me to know everything,&quot; he said. &quot;I'd have an encyclopaedia, the local library, but the important thing was to know who knew the facts, and to know who knew those people. I liked to think that there was someone I knew in every village.<br /><br />&quot;We also had a library in our central office in Liverpool and they kept every newspaper, every cutting of every story. If you wanted anything on a particular subject, the librarians would go and find it and fax it over. They were fantastic.<br /><br />&quot;I kept everything too - I remember a story about a tiny baby being born miles from anywhere in the middle of winter, the weight of a bag of sugar. She was wrapped up in cotton wool in the ambulance as it made its way slowly through the snow and ice across the moors, and she wasn't expected to survive.<br /><br />&quot;I did the story six months later when she left hospital, and then years later, I just happened to go through my cuttings and came across her story. I saw she would have been a few months from her 21st, so I rang around, contacted the local post office, and it turned out she was living a few minutes from my office.<br /><br />&quot;Having Google later was certainly useful. But nothing compares to that personal contact at all.&quot;<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The barrister</span><br />Hilary Heilbron QC began working as a junior barrister in 1972. She is now a member of Brick Court Chambers in London and has practised commercial law and international arbitration.<br /><br />&quot;As a junior barrister, you would get your instruction and you would have to do your own research - law reports, textbooks - and down to the libraries. For other research you would have to go down to the Middle Temple, to find some case that leads to another case.<br /><br />&quot;Now, law reports are all available online - I have a set of law reports on my shelf that look nice but have no real use.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It's a blessing because you can save a lot of time and it's more convenient, but you don't save as much time as there is much more material available than ever before, so you have to check it. You have got to be careful.<br /><br />&quot;You also couldn't advertise in those days, so the idea of all this marketing was anathema. You built up relationships by doing your work well, and you would hope clients would come back.&quot;<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The librarian</span><br />Decades ago, staff at the New York Public Library acted as a form of Human Google, taking questions from members of the public that they would then try to answer with the help of the vast resources at their disposal.<br /><br />In recent years, staff there discovered a box of cards containing the public's questions, and shared them on the library's Instagram account.<br /><br />&quot;Where can I get all available statistics on volume of business, money involved, etc. in the sale of cadavers?&quot; one person asked in 1948.<br />In 2018, Google suggests this Reuters investigation into the trade in dead bodies in the US.<br /><br />&quot;Can mice throw up?&quot; one person wanted to know in 1949, for reasons that are unclear.<br />They were told that yes, mice can indeed throw up.<br /><br />&quot;If a poisonous snake bites itself, will it die?&quot;<br />People in 1949 had some strange questions about animals. Google in 2018 says: err, no-one really knows for certain.<br /><br />&quot;At what time is high noon?&quot;<br />The answer is 12PM.<br /><br />&quot;Why do 18th Century English paintings have so many squirrels in them, and how did they tame them so that they wouldn't bite the painter?&quot;<br /><br />Google suggests that women often kept squirrels as pets in that time, so maybe there's the answer.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The academic</span><br />Janice Yellin completed her PhD in ancient Nubian studies at Brandeis College in Boston in the early 1970s. She is now a professor of art history at Babson College in Massachusetts.<br /><br />&quot;Google changed everything. It means I can access material without having to lose a day to go into the museum or library, and I can do my work much more effectively. It cut the amount of time I need to do research by about 80%.<br /><br />&quot;It was a totally different way of working then, and I can sit at my desk now instead of having to plan my day. I'd be working on something and didn't have enough information, so would have to put it aside to get to the library and look it up.<br /><br />&quot;But there was a communal relationship in libraries, and in the context of someone's career development, there was tremendous value in that. Working online is much more isolating.<br /><br />&quot;There's something nice to be said about spending a day around books and other people. Younger students don't build those networks.&quot;<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion Questions:</span><br />1. Do you rely on Google search during your work or life?<br />2. Is Google search good or bad to our life?<br />3. What would happen if Google were to shut down for 30 minutes or even one day?<br />4. Why has China’s government banned Google?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Agenda:</span><br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />8:10 ~ 8:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:25 ~ 8:30pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:30 ~9:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~9:30pm Concluding remarks/feedback from newcomers<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The meeting place of Thursday:</span><br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第一區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=49">josh</a> — Mon Oct 15, 2018 11:08 pm</p><hr />
