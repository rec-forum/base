Do you think it's easy to make a friend mow adays in our society?<br />2. Do you think nowadays people are getting isolated from others. we are getting lonely ,there are much more distance between everybody?<br />3. Are you a good listener or are you a good communicator ?<br />4. Free Chatting .<br /><br />Sect2<br />&quot;What are you doing after retirement ?<br /><br />1.Chinese people love to dance square dance after retirement,<br />Foreigners do not dance square dances,<br />What do they do after retirement?<br />It will surprise you after reading it!<br /><br />2. &quot;Germans Rent Elderly&quot;<br />Have you heard of &quot;renting out the elderly&quot;? There is a very popular service in Berlin, Germany called &quot;Renting the Elderly&quot;. As the name suggests, young single parents in Germany can rent an elderly person to help them take care of their children at home.<br /><br />The service of the German government was welcomed as soon as it appeared, and more than 700 parents were waiting to rent an old man to go home.<br />The &quot;Grandpa and Grandma for Rent&quot; program not only relieves the burden of single mothers and mothers, but also enriches the life of the elderly in their later years and solves many practical problems.<br /><br />3.&quot;Italians are willing to spend money for themselves&quot;<br />Which country's elderly are the most willing to spend money, Italy deserves its name! Elderly people in western countries do not have the custom of sponsoring their children, they spend more of their money on themselves.<br /><br />In addition to traveling and enjoying life, the elderly in Italy also pay great attention to their appearance.<br />They like to buy jewelry, clothing, etc. for themselves, and they are very particular about dressing.<br />The &quot;new young people in their 60s and 70s&quot; in Italy are the most willing to spend among all age groups in terms of clothing, travel, etc., and their total consumption accounts for two-thirds of the total consumption in Italy.<br /><br />4.&quot;American RV Travel&quot;<br />Americans are independent and straightforward, and they still have an adventurous spirit even after retirement.<br />Most older Americans love the outdoors, and many get out of the house after retirement:<br />&quot;Go and see the world&quot;.<br /><br />The couple travels around the United States in a campervan and a large RV, which has become the most fashionable way of traveling for the elderly in the United States in recent years.<br /><br />5.&quot;Korean Re-employment&quot;<br />70 years old is a rare year,<br />The elderly should enjoy their old age at home,<br />But it's a different story in South Korea.<br />South Korea is currently experiencing a wave of sunset employment.<br /><br />South Korea's aging problem is getting worse, and many job vacancies are left unfilled.<br />In basic service industries such as drivers, security guards, waiters, couriers, and baristas咖啡師, you can often see the shadow of the elderly.<br /><br />6.&quot;British Entrepreneurship創業精神&quot;<br />In the UK, in addition to participating in voluntary charities, many retired people also start new businesses, such as opening cafes, small restaurants, or working as business consultants, starting consulting companies, etc.<br /><br />Some elderly people simply act as &quot;writers&quot; and write at home to enrich their retirement life in a positive way.<br /><br />7.&quot;Japanese Divorce&quot;<br />Japan, which is adjacent(鄰近的) to us, has a unique phenomenon of &quot;retirement divorce&quot;, which means that the divorce rate of men and women increases after retirement.<br /><br />The main reason is that Japanese men are too different before and after retirement. Before retirement, they are busy with work and entertainment every day, and it is difficult to accept the leisure time after retirement.<br /><br />And the wife is also used to her husband's routine of leaving early and returning late every day, and suddenly she starts to face each other ， day and night, which creates more conflicts. These conflicts directly lead to an increase in the divorce rate after retirement.<br /><br />8.&quot;Swiss Save Time Banks&quot;<br />&quot;Time Bank&quot; is a pension project developed by the Swiss Federal Department of Social Insurance -- people save the time for caring for the elderly, and then use it when they are old, sick or need someone to take care of them in the future.<br /><br />Applicants must be in good health, good at communication and full of love, and have plenty of time to take care of the elderly in need every day, and their service hours will be deposited into the personal account of the social security system.<br /><br />When she needs someone to take care of her, she can go to the &quot;time bank&quot; to withdraw &quot;time and time interest&quot; with the &quot;time bank card&quot; in her hand.<br />After the information is verified, &quot;Time Bank&quot; will assign volunteers to take care of her in the hospital or at her home.<br /><br />9.&quot;Poles love to learn&quot;<br />Old people in Poland are still eager to learn more new knowledge after retirement, such as learning computers, music, foreign languages, writing, etc., and regard learning as an indispensable joy of life.<br /><br />10.&quot;Chinese with grandchildren&quot;<br />The traditional Chinese old people are different from the Western concept. There is no other country in the world where parents will be like Chinese parents, worrying about their children from birth to old age. From the time a child is born to getting married, parents can be said to &quot;work hard&quot; for their children.<br />It is not easy for most Chinese elderly people to retire.<br />They will always retire in their children's home.After they are busy with their children and grandchildren, taking care of their grandchildren has become the exclusive choice of most retired Chinese elderly. Many people are busy and worry about their lives all their lives for their children.<br />In recent years, the elderly in China<br />Slowly shift your gaze away from the child,<br />Learn to start enjoying your own life.<br /><br />From the popularity of &quot;living for the aged&quot; nowadays,<br />It can be seen that the concept of the old people<br />Changes have already begun.<br /><br />Sect.2. questions :<br />according to the articles which styles of retirement lifestyle,are you interested ?<br />2.What’s most important thing that you must complete in your life time ?<br />3. of course, healthy life is the essential, tell us, are you physically healthy?<br />if it’s not,are ready to change your lifestyle and make more healthier ?<br />4.Free conversation as you like.</div>
