Well, if your nose is running, your throat feels sore and you think you have a cold, you might mix a tea spoon of garlic juice with some honey and swallow it. If you don’t have any garlic in the kitchen you could try a little boiled onion, the remedy which most people uses nowadays is as Aspirin swallowed with a glass of water, Aspirin is an example of modern chemical medicine, the first chemical medicine were discovered in about one thousand five hundred A.D. That almost five hundred years ago, before chemical medicine, people cured their illnesses with medicine made from plants, herbs and spices which grew naturally in the country side were used to make special teas, ointments and vapors.<br /><br />Today, we think of herbs and spices as things which give our food a pleasant flavor. They also help to keep us healthy. The practice of using herbs and spices as medicines is called herbalism and a person who is an expert on herbalism is called a herbalist. The Emperor Shen Nung (神農) was a herbalist. He died almost five thousand years ago in China at the ripe old age of one hundred and twenty- three. He was very interested in Nature and studied plants and animals all his life. He invented the plow so that farmers could cultivate their land more efficiently. He discovered ways of making plants grow fast and better. He also discovered that most herbs had medicinal properties. He was a very brave man and it is surprising that he lived so long.<br /><br />The Emperor Shen Nung had no science laboratory. There were no methods of chemical analysis to find out what things were made of five thousand years ago. The only way that Shen Nung could find out about herbs was by eating himself. Every day of his life he tried a different herbs. Sometimes he found that it cured him of some illness: fever, headache, upset stomach or backache for example. Sometimes the herbs which he swallowed were poisonous and made him very ill but he always found anther plants which could cure him. There was always an antidote. He experimented on himself all the time. He was a human guinea pig. It is said that many of the results of his experiments were recorded later on in a book called Pen Ts’ao Kang Mu. The book was published and the Chinese people were so impressed with it and found it so useful that it was re-printed many times. You can still find copies of it today.<br /><br />Herbalism was practiced all over the world for thousands of years. In central Europe the travelling Gypsies taught people in towns and cities about the medicinal uses of herbs. The Gypsies were constantly moving from one country to another and very often they took herbal medicines with them. They showed people plants and herbs from different lands and explained how to use them . Monks studied old books and manuscripts and learned about the healing properties of herbs from them. They helped to keep the tradition of herbal medicines alive after chemicals medicines were discovered. The next time you eat a tasty meals, think about the herbs which flavor it . There might be some garlic, there might be some onion, there might be ginger in your dish. Remember that these delicious flavor are actually helping to keep you healthy. Although herbal medicine is the most natural way of curing illness, it is not simple. You should consult a herbalist before your try a herbal cure. He will find out what is wrong with you, diagnose your illness, and then tell you what kind of herbal medicine to take. You should always follow his prescription. We are lucky in the modern world because we have two types of medicine to choose from. Herbal medicine and chemical medicine work side by side to give us long and healthy lives.<br />Discussions:<br />1. The weather in winter is changeable in Taipei. You may unknowingly have a cold. Your nose begins running and your throat feels sore. What will you do in the first step? Ignore it, drinking more water or see a doctor immediately?<br />2. A practice of herbs in our daily life has been thousand years. Do you believe herbalist and have you ever tried any herbs?<br />3. In the martial arts novels , the plot commonly shows that antidotes cure the poison and rescue the leading role. Readers are interested in such an exciting plot of stories. How about you? .<br />4. The western medicine may work quicker, but at the same time it will probably result in side effects; while herbal medicine reflects slower but the property is mild. Which is your preference?<br /><br /><br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Session 2:<br /><br />Sympathy for overworked Taiwan man who ploughed into Ferraris, By Cindy Sui BBC News, Taipei, 19 December 2018<br /><br />A young Taiwanese man who dozed off in his car and crashed into three Ferraris got the shock of his life when he was told it would cost 12 million Taiwan dollars ($390,000; £310,000) to pay for the repairs. But a public outpouring of support and donations to help him pay what at first seemed an insurmountable sum has stunned the 20 year old. Lin Chin-hsiang's predicament has gripped Taiwan and the response from the public reflects growing dissatisfaction with the island's widening wealth gap, which has left many low-income families like Mr. Lin's struggling to make ends meet. The young man from a single parent family dropped out of college earlier this year to help his mother at the family's shop that sells incense and gold paper money (burned during worship) in New Taipei City. His father died from illness a few years ago. He works nightshifts at a barbecue restaurant and, after finishing at 03:00 on Sunday, he returned home to find his mum not feeling well, and so decided to help her deliver an order to a nearby temple in time for a ceremony. It was around 05:40 in the morning when, exhausted from working all night, he fell asleep at the wheel and crashed into the Ferraris. They were among four luxury cars that belonged to a group of friends who were meeting up before a scenic drive. The owners were standing near the vehicles and no-one was injured. &quot;I thought: 'Oh no, I've gotten myself into a big mess.' I was really worried about bringing trouble to my mother and having to pay so much money. I wanted to help her, but made things worse&quot; Mr. Lin told the BBC on Wednesday.<br />Police said he had not been drinking alcohol and had a clean driving record. Local media contacted luxury car dealerships and repair shops to calculate that the repair bill would be 12 million Taiwan dollars. What happened next was something Mr. Lin and his family, trying to figure out how they could pay such a huge sum, had not expected. Dozens of people called the local police station handling the accident and offered to donate money to help pay Mr. Lin's repair bill or his legal fees. Some of them even turned up at the family's shop - a shack made of sheet metal, which also serves as their home. &quot;I'm really grateful to everyone who has offered to help and who has come here to encourage me. Some people even drove up from central Taiwan and asked me where they can donate money. Some spent a long time looking for our shop, some are not in good situation, but they still gave money,&quot; he said, sounding overwhelmed by what has happened. &quot;Some people gave 5,000 ($160) or 10,000. They just said 'In the future, you just have to help society.' &quot;The local authorities have asked people who want to help Mr. Lin to direct their funds to an official account. More than 100 donations have been made - the smallest equal to about $4 and the largest almost $6,500.<br />In total 740,000 Taiwan dollars ($24,000) have already been raised. The college Mr. Lin dropped out of has meanwhile invited him to return. He was in his last year of middle school when his father died. He has an older brother who is working and a sister in high school. Since the story hit the news, some Taiwanese social media users have called on the Ferrari owners to forgive Mr. Lin and not demand money from him, given his circumstances. One owner, however, has publicly said that he worked hard to be able to buy the car and would like to be compensated for the damage. Mr. Lin says the Ferrari owners have been kind and have not insisted he pay the bill all at once. They have instead suggested he could start eventually paying in installments while they consult their insurance companies on how much the policies will cover .With a monthly salary of 35,000 Taiwan dollars ($1,136), it would take Mr. Lin 28 years to pay the full cost of the repairs. His family's vehicle insurance policy only covers injuries not damages. But he insists that covering the cost is the right thing to do. &quot;I'm really sorry to have hit their cars, really sorry. It wasn't intentional… Even though it will take a long time, I committed a wrong. I should still pay for it.&quot;<br /><br />Discussions:<br />1. If you were the victim, how will you cope with the problems? Will you forgive Mr. Lin and not demand money from him, given his circumstances?.<br />2. Due to be exhausted from working all night, Mr. Lin crashed into the Ferraris. With a monthly salary of 35,000 Taiwan dollars, he is unaffordable to pay such high repair fee. Do you empathy with Mr. Lin’s predicament?<br />3. While driving on the roads, do you try to avoid closing to the luxurious cars surroundings so that it won’t cause you any troubles? <br />4.Why such an accident story caused a lot of discussions? What does it reflect about the social problem?<br /> <br />P.S.<br />1.參加三次後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />2.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~</div>
