12/21(Sat.)French government spells out pension plan to calm strikes &amp; Is this the death of cash?(Host:Danny)<br /><br />Article1:<br />French government spells out pension plan to calm strikes<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/lang/archives/2019/12/14/2003727491">http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/lang/ar ... 2003727491</a><!-- m --> <br /><br />France’s prime minister said Wednesday that the full retirement age will be increased for the country’s youngest, but offered concessions in an ill-fated effort to calm a nationwide protest against pension reforms that critics say will erode the nation’s way of life.<br />The government is trying to make the pensions system sustainable and simpler but is facing public pressure, including a week of the most debilitating transport strikes in decades.<br />All metro lines bar two were closed and many train routes remained canceled as unions dug in their heels against President Emmanuel Macron, whom they accuse of shaping policies in favor of the rich.<br />Prime Minister Edouard Philippe detailed the pension reforms in a speech on Wednesday in central Paris, saying that the French “will need to work longer.” People born after 1974 will have to work until the age of 64 to get a full pension, instead of 62 previously. Those born before that date will not be affected in any way, he said.<br />The system replaces a complicated pension system that included dozens of special privileges for some sectors, like public transport, with one set of rules for all.<br />Philippe said the changes would ensure the pension system is “fair and sustainable” in the face of a growing population with a record number of people over 90.<br />Many French people and the unions leading the strikes fear the new system will force people to work longer for smaller pension allocations.<br /><br />Question<br />1.What is the most stressful part about working at Strike?<br />2.Do you agree the protesters go on the street to protest their rights? Do you think they are greedy?<br />3. How to balance the boss and worker?<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Article2:<br />Is this the death of cash?<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/chinese/features/take-away-english/ep-190401">http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/ch ... /ep-190401</a><!-- m --> <br /><br />Cash is king, or so they say. In one form or another, human beings have been carrying around money for hundreds of years. Metal was first coined into cash between 700 and 600 BC by the Lydians, and banknotes have been in circulation since their first use in China around 1000 AD. These days, though, habits have changed. Modern technology means that while money is still widely used, it's more likely to be a digital transaction than a wad of notes and a handful of shrapnel. If cash is king, then it may eventually be dethroned.<br />In the UK, the use of tangible currency is in decline. In 2017, the banking trade body UK Finance reported a 15% fall in the use of ready money. Since their first use, debit card payments have given cash a run for its money. Last year, for the first time ever, the use of debit cards and contactless payments became the most popular way to stump up. In fact, if trends continue, the use of cold hard cash, would end by 2026, says the report.<br />For businesses, the smart money is on not taking cash. By doing so, they are in the money. For example, the Boot pub in Freston opened last year as a cashless pub. In a BBC article, its owner Mike Keen lists several advantages, including a quicker speed of service, lower insurance premiums since no cash is kept on site, and a saving in time as he needn't cash up each day nor make a deposit in the bank several times each week.<br />However, eight million people in the UK still need cash, according to the Access to Cash Review, an independent body measuring the need for cash in the UK. Those living in rural areas with poor internet connectivity and people who have physical or mental health issues are among those that find it difficult to use digital services. In addition, many service providers, such as window cleaners, are still paid cash in hand. Not to mention, budgeting, which is easier with cash since &quot;you know what you've got,&quot; interviewee Kev Jackson told the BBC.<br />Is cash dead? Not yet it would seem, though as more technological solutions to payment, such as smart watches, become commonplace, its use is likely to decline more. What's important is, the report concludes, to put in place infrastructure to ensure that those who still need to pay the good, old-fashioned way can get their money's worth.<br /> Question<br />1. Why are businesses and retailers turning to a cashless system? <br />2. What do you prefer , cash or cashless? Do you like to use it? Do you use Apps?<br />3. What is the risk of using cash? What is the risk of cashless?<br />4. Do you afraid of your personal date spread out when you use cashless system? <br /><br /><br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Agenda<br />7:00 ~ 7:30 pm greetings &amp; free talk<br />7:30 ~ 8:15 pm guests introduced &amp; first session discussion<br />8:15 ~ 8:45 pm presentation, sharing the article &amp; other experiences<br />8:45 ~ 9:30 pm second session discussion<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven,<br />板橋民生路二段237 號,<br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30,<br />a minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12531">Danny Lin</a> — Thu Dec 19, 2019 1:26 am</p><hr />
