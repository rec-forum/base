5/4(Sat.)12 Tech Innovations That Will Change The World By 2020/Terry Gou Invokes Sea Goddess Mazu, Announces Run for President(Host: Alan)<br /><br /><br /><br />Article 1:12 Tech Innovations That Will Change The World By 2020 <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://nethosting.com/12-tech-innovations-that-will-change-the-world-by-2020/">https://nethosting.com/12-tech-innovati ... d-by-2020/</a><!-- m --> <br /><br />With improved smartphone capabilities, wearable devices that monitor your health, and virtual reality developments rapidly expanding, we live in an exciting time for advances in technology. There are some game-changing tech innovations in the works that could dramatically impact everyday life in the next 5 years.<br /><br />After scouring the internet, we were able to compile this list of tech innovations you’ll see by 2020. We advise that you prepare for the robot takeover accordingly.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">1. The World Welcomes The First ‘Social Family Robot’</span><br /><br />Release Date: December 2015<br />Price: $749<br /><br />Jibo is advertised as the world’s first ‘social family robot’, but how much can this desk lamp/Wall-E hybrid do for you? Jibo’s greatest feature may be that it can recognize the face of everyone in your family to deliver messages to the right person at the right time.<br /><br />It can also read stories to your kids and order takeout, with artificial intelligence that helpsit fit in with your lifestyle. It runs on AC power, with an included charger pad that stays underneath the Jibo wherever you place it. Jibo was a smash hit on Indiegogo, raising almost $4 million last year.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">2. Work From Home Or Attend Meetings Remotely With This Creepy Robot</span><br /><br />Release Date: Available now<br />Price: $1,995<br /><br />Ever wanted to attend a meeting or work from home without lag and limited camera angles? With BeamPro, now you can. Anyone with a computer can use BeamPro and navigate the device with a keyboard, game controller, or mouse. The camera gives a similar visual angle as you would have being there in person.<br /><br />The possibilities of BeamPro are endless – imagine never having to make a phone call or Skype meeting again. Instead, you can invite people to use BeamPro to have a discussion in person, while in your office space. The price may need to come down before we see more of these devices in the workplace, but they have the potential to change working from home as we know it.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">3. Wearables That Change Your Mood And Make You Healthier</span><br /><br />Release Date: Available now<br /><br />Price: $299<br /><br />2015 so far has brought us the Galaxy Gear, Apple Watch, Fitbit and other wearables that seem to be the latest trend. But you probably haven’t heard of Thync, a wearable that promises to make you feel more calm or energized – with simple vibration patterns you control with your smartphone.<br /><br />There’s also the Healbe Gobe, a bracelet that claims to be the only way to automatically measure calorie intake (through your skin). The device is more than just an ordinary health tracker, it can estimate your calorie intake within an 80 percent margin of accuracy. Though they may be ahead of their time, wearables with enhanced capabilities like these could be more popular in the next five years.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">4. 3D Printed Food</span><br /><br />Release Date: October 2015, likely later<br />Price: $1,000 – $2,000<br /><br />A 3D printer that prints delicious healthy meals? It may be coming in the near future – several devices are already in the works and will soon be hitting the shelves. Currently, the most these food printers can do is prepare food, you’ll have to bake the dishes yourself. They probably won’t be in everyone’s kitchen until they’re capable of producing fully cooked meals, which could be possible in the next few years.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">5. Near-Instant Drone Delivery</span><br /><br />Release Date: 2017<br /><br />Price: $1<br /><br />Remember this? Amazon Prime 30-minute air delivery was all over the news last year, then quickly forgotten when drone restrictions pushed back development. Amazon isn’t giving up on the race for instant delivery, but ultimately the Federal Aviation Administration will determine if this service will ever exist.<br /><br />If flying regulations for drones change, same-day drone delivery could be implemented within the next five years. 30 minute delivery would only cost an additional $1 to Prime members. Amazon just recently proposed a plan for a drone superhighway in the sky that would allow their drowns to have a separate flying zone.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">6. Commercial Spaceflight and Tourism</span><br /><br />Release Date: 2016<br /><br />Price: $250,000<br /><br />You may have heard of Virgin Galactic – the commercial spaceline backed by celebrities and famous investors. Commercial space travel is an industry that’s sure to take off before 2020, with space hotels and orbital space balloons currently in development. Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson still plans to launch in 2016, despite a crash last year that resulted in the death of a pilot.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Sunscreen Pills</span><br /><br />Release Date: 2016<br /><br />Price: $30<br /><br />Though you may have already seen sunscreen pills on the market, but they’re nothing like what you may find in grocery stores within the next few years. In 2011, The Guardian reported that researchers were developing a sunscreen substitute from, believe-it-or-not – coral.<br /><br />There’s a scientific race going on right now to develop a pill that would be an effective substitute for regular slathered-on sunscreen. The sunscreen pills you see today are only supplemental to sunscreen, but one day soon we may have a pill that we could take for full UV protection.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">8. The Dawn of Virtual Reality</span><br /><br />Release Date: 2016<br />Price: $350 – $599<br /><br />This video gives a demonstration of the Cyberith Virtualizer, an immersive gaming device that pairs with a virtual reality headset. The user can run, walk, and even jump while using various controllers to perform actions like shooting an arrow, casting spells, and more.<br /><br />2016 is going to be a huge year for virtual reality with the debut of the Oculus Rift headset, virtual reality gaming centers, and accessories like the Cyberith that will enable gaming to be more realistic than ever before.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">9. Supersonic Jets That Cut Travel Time in Half</span><br /><br />Release Date: 2018<br /><br />Price: $80 million<br /><br />Most of us probably won’t have $80 million lying around in a couple years, but the Spike Aerospace s-512 is still an innovation worth noting. This personal jet can fly from New York to London in just three hours, a flight that would normally take over six hours. The s-512 is going to add a substantial value to those who conduct business overseas, but could also spawn an era of faster planes that are twice as efficient.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">10. Incredibly Fast 5G Wireless Speed</span><br /><br />Release Date: 2020<br /><br />Price: Not Free<br /><br />Wireless speeds 66 times faster than what we currently have could be here by 2020 (though widespread availability won’t be until a few years later), and it will change everything. This article from CNET explains that 5G speeds would enable us to download a two hour long film in 3.6 seconds, compared to 6 minutes with 4G and 26 hours at 3G speed.<br /><br />Analysts suggest the number of devices connected to a mobile network will more than triple by 2020, from 5 billion in 2015 to 25 billion by 2020. With that many devices fighting for bandwidth, wireless speeds will have to compete in order to keep up. 5G research and development is expensive, so is restructuring existing networks – so phone bills may also increase.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">11. Universal Translation</span><br /><br />Release Date: 2020<br /><br />Price: Free<br /><br />Most of us are familiar with Google Translate, a free online service that can translate almost every language. What you probably aren’t aware of is that with our help, Google Translate has been improving its language recognition.<br /><br />Google Translate will eventually be able to use real-time speech translation, so a user won’t have to enter text to be able to translate. Google’s head of translation services estimated it will only be a few years before their service will work well enough for global use.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">12. A Reality TV Show On Mars</span><br /><br />Release Date: 2027<br />Price: $6 billion<br /><br />Alright, we had to stretch the dates a little to include this one, but it’s a project that’s currently in development and worth noting. In 2013, the Mars One mission was all over social media and the news – several candidates were going to be selected to inhabit Mars on a live reality TV show.<br /><br />It’s about as far-fetched as it sounds, but even after wide media scrutiny that the project will fail, CEO Bas Lansdorp insists it’s still possible.<br /><br />100 applicants were recently selected out of their initial pool of 200,000 to move on to the next round of selection. Funding may be a setback for the Mars One mission, but Lansdorp remains enthusiastic that they will be able to raise the money with TV deals and crowdfunding.<br /><br />What’s your favorite item on our list?

Gou then finally declared a run earlier today, with the claim that he was told to run by the sea goddess Mazu.<br /><br />Gou, Taiwan’s richest man, has long been touted as a possible presidential candidate for the KMT in 2020 elections, but he has been relatively quiet in the past half year. Nevertheless, Gou has been overshadowed in the past half year by current Kaohsiung mayor Han Kuo-yu (韓國瑜). Han is a figure who notably has a similar public persona to Gou, given the view of Han as a heterodox candidate whose background is more in business than in politics, and who breaks from political norms because of his willingness to speak frankly and boldly, even when this ruffles feathers.<br /><br />This is a public persona similar to Gou’s. Likewise, both Gou and Han’s public personas tout their business achievements, as the CEO of FoxConn and the former CEO of the Taipei Agricultural Marketing Promotion Corporation respectively. That being said, Han is no newcomer to politics, having previously served as a legislator from 1993 to 2002, yet this has escaped notice by many members of the public.<br /><br />Gou’s name began to be floated as a possible KMT presidential candidate in late 2016 and early 2017. Gou benefited from the view in Taiwan after the presidential victory of Donald Trump in November 2016 that Trump was a successful example of a businessman with no prior political experience entering politics. This sparked discussion in Taiwan of whether Trump’s electoral successes was an early sign that a wave of wealthy business owners lacking in political experience would seek public office.<br /><br />One notes that similar discussion broke out in other parts of the world in the wake of Trump’s victory, notably in Indonesia, and that after Trump’s victory, a number of billionaires began to seek the Democratic presidential nomination in the United States, including former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz. Yet in Taiwan, the claim that businessmen could win public office dovetailed nicely with the victories of political amateurs with no prior political experience such as Taipei mayor Ko Wen-je or the young politicians of the New Power Party (NPP) in 2014 and 2016, something phrased as “everyday people participating in politics” in public discourse.<br /><br />Gou benefited from this pro-business turn in Taiwanese political discourse, as did Han later on. At the same time, Gou seemed like a viable candidate for a cash-strapped KMT, seeing as the KMT has historically been able to overwhelm challengers by relying on the substantial assets it retained well into Taiwanese democratization dating back to property seizures by the former one-party-state. Yet such party assets are currently under scrutiny by the Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) administration’s party assets probe, as part of its broader efforts to promote transitional justice.<br /><br />Gou’s political ambitions have long been known, for example, as observed in strange, abortive moves to win young people to his side during the 2014 Sunflower Movement in a means that broke with the actions of KMT party heavyweights such as then-president Ma Ying-jeou. In past years, Gou had also taken steps to ally himself with then-party chair Hung Hsiu-chu (洪秀柱) in late 2016, lending the KMT to tide it over during the Tsai administration’s probe into its illicit party assets.<br /><br />Gou building a political relationship with American president Donald Trump by signing an MOU to construct a FoxConn plant in Wisconsin may have also been an action aimed at a future presidential run. This would be a means of allaying one of Gou’s largest political liabilities, his starkly pro-China image, by building closer ties with the United States. Indeed, having made many promises to construct Foxconn plants in a number of places across the world that he never followed through with, particularly in India, Gou was always unlikely to follow through on the construction of the Wisconsin plant.<br /><br />Yet with the meteoric rise of Han Kuo-yu in the past year for reasons few have been able to adequately explain, Gou has long been overshadowed. It is thus to be questioned as to whether Gou is now attempting to claw his way back into the limelight. This would seem to be the rationale behind aggressively attacking DPP legislator Hsiao Bi-khim (蕭美琴) at the Q-and-A section of the 2019 Indo-Pacific Security Dialogue for not looking him in the eye while responding to a question, as a way of inciting a public incident. Gou would also set up a Facebook page for the first time in January, one month after the end of nine-in-one elections in late November last year, in order to try and build up his appeal among young people that use Facebook.<br /><br />With Gou throwing his hat into the race at this juncture, Gou would be entering a crowded race in which he is already be contending with former presidential candidate and former New Taipei City Mayor Eric Chu (朱立倫), former majority speaker Wang Jin-pyng (王金平), who is also the head of the “Taiwanese” faction of the KMT, and possibly current chair Wu Den-yih (吳敦義), who has publicly ruled out a run for president, but may still hope to be invited to run.<br /><br />Likewise, although Han has also publicly ruled out running, it is possible that Han similarly hopes for the party to come to him with an invite to run, rather than being seen as disrupting the internal hierarchy of the party through his personal ambitions. 2016 presidential elections set the precedent of the KMT switching candidates midway through elections and it is not impossible that for 2020 presidential elections, any less than successful KMT presidential candidate could be swapped midway through with Han.<br /><br />As for Gou, it is possible that Gou attempting to contend with Han for the KMT presidential nomination is simply too little, too late. It is possible that the end result will be Gou may be hoping to secure other concessions from the KMT, such as seeking the vice presidential nomination and running on a joint ticket with Han. Though unlikely, Gou could even run as an independent candidate if he fails to secure the KMT presidential nomination, seeing as he could fund his own run.<br /><br />However, in the absence of Han declaring a run, it is anyone’s guess as to whether he may edge out Chu, Wang, or Wu. And it is not impossible that in a race with either of the three absent Han, Gou may still benefit from his superficial similarities to Han, with the “Han fever” continuing to be in full swing.<br /><br /><br />Discussion:<br /><br />Q1. What's your opinion about Terry Gou to decide on 2020 presidential run? <br />Q2. If Terry Gou could be as 2020 President in Taiwan, it would be good or bad to Taiwan in the future? <br />Q3. Do you think this is a conspiracy or trick of the Chinese Communist Party? <br />Q4. Do you think there is any impact on KMT primary election? <br />Q5. Taiwan's Trump? Foxconn's Terry Gou Wants to 'Make the ROC Great Again'. What is your idea for the discrepancy in personality or Political and economic status between Terry Gou and Trump? <br /><br /><br /><br />//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////<br /><br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00 ~ 7:30 pm greetings &amp; free talk <br />7:30 ~ 8:15 pm guests introduced &amp; first session discussion <br />8:15 ~ 8:45 pm presentation, sharing the article &amp; other experiences <br />8:45 ~ 9:30 pm second session discussion<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />a minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12531">Danny Lin</a> — Sun Apr 28, 2019 11:43 pm</p><hr />
