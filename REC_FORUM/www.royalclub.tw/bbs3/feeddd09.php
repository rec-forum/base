Where the homeless can board a bus to take a warm shower<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/01/health/cnn-hero-doniece-sandoval-lava-mae/index.html">http://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/01/healt ... index.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />San Francisco (CNN)Five years ago, Doniece Sandoval gained a new perspective on San Francisco's immense problem of homelessness. It happened in her own neighborhood. &quot;There were three elderly gentlemen, all in their 80s, who we watched, one by one, get evicted,&quot; she said. &quot;They began to live in their cars, had their cars repossessed, and ended up on the street.&quot;<br /><br />As the Bay Area bounced back from the economic recession, Sandoval saw rents skyrocket. Diverse areas in and around San Francisco became gentrified, trendy -- and pricey. And as tech companies and other businesses moved in, lower-income residents were forced out. Sandoval saw more and more people living and sleeping on the streets. And all of them, she said, were struggling with hygiene. When she learned there were fewer than 20 shower stalls and toilets for thousands of homeless individuals, she was shocked. &quot;For the homeless community, it was the equivalent of being in a third-world country,&quot; she said.<br /><br />Then she came across an article about the city's plans to replace old public buses. It gave her an idea.<br />In 2013, Sandoval obtained and began converting retired city buses into mobile shower units. Her nonprofit, Lava Mae, has since provided more than 20,000 showers to more than 4,000 homeless individuals. &quot;People come out after showering, sometimes they're crying, sometimes they're ecstatic, sometimes they ... hug us. And it's incredibly humbling to see that level of gratitude for something that should just be a basic human right,&quot; Sandoval said.<br /><br />Today, the organization -- whose name is a play on the Spanish translation of &quot;wash me&quot; -- relies on commercial shower trailers, providing 30-to-50,000 showers a year. The group has expanded its services to Los Angeles and Silicon Valley and plans to release a toolkit this month to help other communities create this service. CNN's Allie Torgan spoke with Sandoval about her work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.<br /><br />DISCUSSIONS<br />Q1: Do you think shower bus will be popular in Taiwan?<br />Q2: Do you think shower bus should be put in which place can help the most people?<br />Q3: Do you think shower bus can self-sufficiency work in forever?<br /><br />=========================================================================<br />While the United States is walking away from the historic Paris Climate Agreement, India is making a bold vow to start selling only electric cars by 2030.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/03/technology/future/india-electric-cars/index.html">http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/03/technol ... index.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />India is one of the world's most polluted countries. Its energy department said in a blog post that it has set the &quot;ambitious&quot; target to stop selling gas-powered vehicles in an attempt to clean up its air.<br />As the country's economy has boomed, new industries and commuters have spewed pollutants in the air at staggering rates. Now, its 1.3 billion residents are suffering. One estimate says India's air contributes to 1.2 million deaths per year. Doctors have said breathing the air in New Dehli, the nation's capital, is like smoking 10 cigarettes a day.<br /><br />India's energy minister, Piyush Goyal, said recently that the country will help facilitate the electric car effort by offering subsidies for a couple of years. &quot;After that,&quot; he said, &quot;the cost of electric vehicles will start paying for themselves.&quot;<br />The government's National Electric Mobility Mission Plan wants annual sales of electric and hybrid cars to hit 6 million to 7 million by 2020.<br /><br />DISCUSSIONS:<br />Q1: Do you think electric car will be popular in Taiwan?<br />Q2: Do you think solar energy equipment installed upon electric car can get more power?<br />Q3: Do you think electric car really can change air pollution problem?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">dora</a> — Wed Jun 14, 2017 12:18 am</p><hr />
