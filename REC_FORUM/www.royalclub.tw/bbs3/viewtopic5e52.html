Emily Dickinson was able to convey it in language, Goya in an image. Half the purpose of art is to describe such iconic states. <br /><br />As for me, I had always thought myself tough, one of the people who could survive if I'd been sent to a concentration camp. <br /><br />In 1991, I had a series of losses. My mother died, a relationship I'd been in ended, I moved back to the United States from some years abroad, and I got through all of those experiences intact. <br /><br />But in 1994, three years later, I found myself losing interest in almost everything. I didn't want to do any of the things I had previously wanted to do, and I didn't know why. The opposite of depression is not happiness, but vitality. And it was vitality that seemed to seep away from me in that moment. Everything there was to do seemed like too much work. I would come home and I would see the red light flashing on my answering machine, and instead of being thrilled to hear from my friends, I would think, &quot;What a lot of people that is to have to call back.&quot; Or I would decide I should have lunch, and then I would think, but I'd have to get the food out and put it on a plate and cut it up and chew it and swallow it, and it felt to me like the Stations of the Cross. <br /><br />And one of the things that often gets lost in discussions of depression is that you know it's ridiculous. You know it's ridiculous while you're experiencing it. You know that most people manage to listen to their messages and eat lunch and organize themselves to take a shower and go out the front door and that it's not a big deal, and yet you are nonetheless in its grip and you are unable to figure out any way around it. And so I began to feel myself doing less and thinking less and feeling less. It was a kind of nullity. <br /><br />And then the anxiety set in. If you told me that I'd have to be depressed for the next month, I would say, &quot;As long I know it'll be over in November, I can do it.&quot; But if you said to me, &quot;You have to have acute anxiety for the next month,&quot; I would rather slit my wrist than go through it. It was the feeling all the time like that feeling you have if you're walking and you slip or trip and the ground is rushing up at you, but instead of lasting half a second, the way that does, it lasted for six months. It's a sensation of being afraid all the time but not even knowing what it is that you're afraid of. And it was at that point that I began to think that it was just too painful to be alive, and that the only reason not to kill oneself was so as not to hurt other people. <br /><br />And finally one day, I woke up and I thought perhaps I'd had a stroke, because I lay in bed completely frozen, looking at the telephone, thinking, &quot;Something is wrong and I should call for help,&quot; and I couldn't reach out my arm and pick up the phone and dial. And finally, after four full hours of my lying and staring at it, the phone rang, and somehow I managed to pick it up, and it was my father, and I said, &quot;I'm in serious trouble. We need to do something.&quot; <br /><br />The next day I started with the medications and the therapy. And I also started reckoning with this terrible question: If I'm not the tough person who could have made it through a concentration camp, then who am I? And if I have to take medication, is that medication making me more fully myself, or is it making me someone else? And how do I feel about it if it's making me someone else? <br /><br />I had two advantages as I went into the fight. The first is that I knew that, objectively speaking, I had a nice life, and that if I could only get well, there was something at the other end that was worth living for. And the other was that I had access to good treatment. <br /><br />But I nonetheless emerged and relapsed, and emerged and relapsed, and emerged and relapsed, and finally understood I would have to be on medication and in therapy forever. And I thought, &quot;But is it a chemical problem or a psychological problem? And does it need a chemical cure or a philosophical cure?&quot; And I couldn't figure out which it was. And then I understood that actually, we aren't advanced enough in either area for it to explain things fully. The chemical cure and the psychological cure both have a role to play, and I also figured out that depression was something that was braided so deep into us that there was no separating it from our character and personality. <br /><br />I want to say that the treatments we have for depression are appalling. They're not very effective. They're extremely costly. They come with innumerable side effects. They're a disaster. But I am so grateful that I live now and not 50 years ago, when there would have been almost nothing to be done. I hope that 50 years hence, people will hear about my treatments and be appalled that anyone endured such primitive science. <br /><br />Depression is the flaw in love. If you were married to someone and thought, &quot;Well, if my wife dies, I'll find another one,&quot; it wouldn't be love as we know it. There's no such thing as love without the anticipation of loss, and that specter of despair can be the engine of intimacy. <br /><br />There are three things people tend to confuse: depression, grief and sadness. Grief is explicitly reactive. If you have a loss and you feel incredibly unhappy, and then, six months later, you are still deeply sad, but you're functioning a little better, it's probably grief, and it will probably ultimately resolve itself in some measure. If you experience a catastrophic loss, and you feel terrible, and six months later you can barely function at all, then it's probably a depression that was triggered by the catastrophic circumstances. The trajectory tells us a great deal. People think of depression as being just sadness. It's much, much too much sadness, much too much grief at far too slight a cause. <br /><br />As I set out to understand depression, and to interview people who had experienced it, I found that there were people who seemed, on the surface, to have what sounded like relatively mild depression who were nonetheless utterly disabled by it. And there were other people who had what sounded as they described it like terribly severe depression who nonetheless had good lives in the interstices between their depressive episodes. And I set out to find out what it is that causes some people to be more resilient than other people. What are the mechanisms that allow people to survive? And I went out and I interviewed person after person who was suffering with depression. <br /><br />One of the first people I interviewed described depression as a slower way of being dead, and that was a good thing for me to hear early on because it reminded me that that slow way of being dead can lead to actual deadness, that this is a serious business. It's the leading disability worldwide, and people die of it every day. <br /><br />One of the people I talked to when I was trying to understand this was a beloved friend who I had known for many years, and who had had a psychotic episode in her freshman year of college, and then plummeted into a horrific depression. She had bipolar illness, or manic depression, as it was then known. And then she did very well for many years on lithium, and then eventually, she was taken off her lithium to see how she would do without it, and she had another psychosis, and then plunged into the worst depression that I had ever seen in which she sat in her parents' apartment, more or less catatonic, essentially without moving, day after day after day. And when I interviewed her about that experience some years later -- she's a poet and psychotherapist named Maggie Robbins -- when I interviewed her, she said, &quot;I was singing 'Where Have All The Flowers Gone,' over and over, to occupy my mind. I was singing to blot out the things my mind was saying, which were, 'You are nothing. You are nobody. You don't even deserve to live.' And that was when I really started thinking about killing myself.&quot; <br /><br />You don't think in depression that you've put on a gray veil and are seeing the world through the haze of a bad mood. You think that the veil has been taken away, the veil of happiness, and that now you're seeing truly. It's easier to help schizophrenics who perceive that there's something foreign inside of them that needs to be exorcised, but it's difficult with depressives, because we believe we are seeing the truth. <br /><br />But the truth lies. I became obsessed with that sentence: &quot;But the truth lies.&quot; And I discovered, as I talked to depressive people, that they have many delusional perceptions. People will say, &quot;No one loves me.&quot; And you say, &quot;I love you, your wife loves you, your mother loves you.&quot; You can answer that one pretty readily, at least for most people. But people who are depressed will also say, &quot;No matter what we do, we're all just going to die in the end.&quot; Or they'll say, &quot;There can be no true communion between two human beings. Each of us is trapped in his own body.&quot; To which you have to say, &quot;That's true, but I think we should focus right now on what to have for breakfast.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />Question:<br />1.

His next scheduled vacation is a domestic trip to Maine this fall. It's somewhere safe and far away from the crowds.<br />So much is still up in the air when it comes to summer travel. Will there be a second coronavirus wave? Will the political conventions and presidential election cause more civil unrest? And what if the economy takes a turn for the worse?<br />Plyant, an architect from Austin, Texas, is among millions of American travelers who are worried about, well, everything. But he's staying flexible.<br />&quot;Our summer travel plans have been in limbo for quite some time while we waited to see what was going to happen with reopenings,&quot; he says.<br /><br />Americans are traveling this summer<br />More than half of consumers (53%) plan to get away on a summer vacation, according to a new survey by The Out of Home Advertising Association of America (OAAA), a trade association representing billboard advertisers. Road trips will be back in a big way this summer, with 62% of consumers planning to travel by car for summer vacation — up 72% from last summer. <br />&quot;Consumers around the country are eager to get out of their homes and travel this summer,&quot; says Anna Bager, OAAA’s CEO.<br />To get an idea of how drive-happy Americans are this summer, consider this number from a recent Turo survey: 46% of respondents said they would be willing to drive more than five hours instead of flying to a destination. <br />Sorry, airlines. <br />Yet some travelers are scared. Another survey by RetailMeNot suggests that fear and anxiety will continue to keep many Americans at home this summer. Over a quarter (26%) say they are afraid to travel for any reason in the near future, whether for work or leisure.<br />So what will it be like to travel this summer? <br />&quot;It is relatively difficult to predict summer travel now, particularly after the massive national protests,&quot; says Zongqing Zhou, a professor at the College of Hospitality and Tourism Management of Niagara University. <br />He says the protests have changed the dynamic of the summer travel season. They could trigger a second coronavirus wave, which may crush a fragile economic recovery. And we won't know about the effects of the protests and the possible coronavirus resurgence until the end of June at the earliest, by which time most summer vacations will have been planned.<br />What are American travelers afraid of this summer?<br />1.	Coronavirus. Specifically, a second wave of the virus later this summer. Those fears pummeled the stock market last week, as several states showed an unexpected increase in infections.<br />2.	Civil unrest. While the protests have eased up and been mostly peaceful, it wouldn't take much to ignite them again.<br />3.	Collapsing economies. With unemployment at 13% and the recovery in a fragile state, the future is anyone's guess. Other countries are in worse trouble.<br />And yet, experts say staying at home isn't necessarily the best option.<br />&quot;Many people rely on travel and vacation to decompress and take care of their mental health,&quot; says Lisa Lee, a public health expert specializing in infectious disease epidemiology and public health ethics at Virginia Tech. &quot;That's extremely important — especially now.&quot;<br />Will there be a second COVID-19 wave?<br />Coronavirus remains front-and-center for most American travelers. People like Mary Vogel, who would ordinarily be vacationing this summer, are staying closer to home to avoid an infection. She'd like to know what it will be like to travel this summer. But for her, even a road trip is a risk. <br />&quot;We are concerned about bathroom stops, food and hotels on a long driving trip,&quot; she says. &quot;Sure, we can take our own cleaning products and scrub everything down and pack a big cooler for meals — but to us, that's not a vacation.&quot;<br />Instead, she's betting COVID-19 will be gone by 2021, when she and her husband are planning a cruise.<br />No one knows if coronavirus will spread further this summer or fade away. But Dan Richards, CEO of Global Rescue, says you can take precautions. By avoiding what Richards calls the &quot;three Cs&quot; — confined spaces, crowds, and close contact. &quot;You can dramatically reduce the likelihood of contracting the virus,&quot; he says.<br />&quot;Physical distancing while camping is still recommended, especially if you – or anyone you come in contact with – have potentially been exposed in the preceding 14 days,&quot; adds Richards.<br />What should you do about civil unrest?<br />The recent nationwide protests have injected even more uncertainty, making it harder to predict what it will be like to travel this summer. <br />&quot;The death of George Floyd while in police custody has led to protests, riots and in some cases looting and destruction of property in the U.S. and abroad,&quot; says Christine Buggy, vice president of marketing at Travelex Insurance Services. &quot;When selecting a destination for a summer trip, travelers should consider if their prospective destination is currently being impacted. It ultimately lies with the traveler to decide if they feel safe traveling to a destination where civil disorder is occurring.&quot;<br />How do you avoid hotspots? Follow local news carefully. You can also find reliable information about domestic civil unrest on foreign government websites, such as Canada's Official Global Travel Advisories. Also, consult an app like TripIt, which rates areas based on COVID-19 infections and travel safety conditions. TripIt also offers ratings in other categories, including theft, women's safety, LGBTQ safety, and physical harm.<br />But say you're driving through town and find yourself in a riot? Jason Hanson, a former CIA officer who now edits the Spy &amp; Survival Briefing, says that's a difficult scenario. If you stop, the protesters could smash your windshield and pull you out of the vehicle. But you don't want to plow into the crowd, either. Hanson recommends slowing down to less than 5 mph and not colliding with any pedestrians.<br />&quot;Keep moving, no matter what,&quot; he says. &quot;People will get out of your way.&quot;<br />How about the economy?<br />Unless there's a &quot;V&quot; shaped recovery, the travel industry will continue to struggle with low occupancy rates and load factors. Travelers may have less money to spend. Experts say that when it comes to what it will be like to travel this summer, one thing is certain: There will be deals.<br />&quot;We expect a variety of travel promotions and unique offerings from hotels, cruise lines and more to help stimulate both the economy and a continued love for travel,&quot; says April Miller, a travel consultant from Newport News, Va. &quot;There may not be a better time to get out there and see the world in an economic sense. The savings and promotions could be incredible.&quot; <br />But don't ignore the risks. Bruce McIndoe, the founder of WorldAware, says one challenge will be the financial stability of companies and the likely number of failures across the travel industry in the months ahead. <br />&quot;This includes airlines, hotels, auto rental companies, and just about any other supplier to the industry,&quot; says. &quot;As such, travelers should take extra precautions when preparing and booking trips.&quot;<br />McIndoe recommends buying travel insurance, and using a credit, which can offer some protection against default, and buying travel insurance.<br />Expert advice on summer travel<br />Between the civil unrest, COVID-19 and collapsing economies, no one really knows what it will be like to travel this summer. So what's the best way to minimize your risk of exposure to a riot or infection? Apart from the expert advice on staying safe, the most important precaution you can take may be travel insurance.<br />And not just any policy, since a lot of travel insurance excludes pandemics and may have exclusions for civil unrest. Jeremy Murchland, president of Seven Corners, says a &quot;cancel for any reason&quot; policy would protect your entire vacation. <br />&quot;You would be buying a plan with much wider coverage for trip cancellation, including situations like financial hardship, personal reasons such as divorce or family issues, change of mind, work issues, canceled wedding or event, or even feeling unsafe due to political unrest or the state of the economy,&quot; he says.<br />I covered &quot;cancel for any reason&quot; policies in a recent FORBES story. <br />Get out of town (but not too far out of town)<br />Becky Powell, president of Protravel International, says it's a safe bet to get out of town — but not too far out of town. Her clients are opting for driving vacations to some out-of-the-way places.<br />&quot;Right now, we are seeing a great deal of interest in outdoor-oriented activities, national parks, private homes and villas and domestic destinations and resorts,&quot; she says. Among them is the remote luxury resort at Amangiri in Utah or the country manor experience of Blantyre Castle in Massachusetts.<br />Also, take a little time to read the fine print on the terms of your purchase. That's what Melissa Downham, a Virtuoso-affiliated travel advisor for Departure Lounge, is telling her clients this summer.<br />&quot;I'm encouraging clients to be very careful and cognizant about their cancellation policies and terms and conditions,&quot; she says. &quot;In particular, I am asking my clients to familiarize themselves with force majeure and what it could mean for their vacation. Many people book trips without even glancing at what the cancellation policies are.&quot;<br />That's sound advice. This summer may be the most unpredictable for travel in a generation, but attention to the fine print, insurance and a little common sense will get you through it. <br />Oh, and don't forget to have fun.<br />Related: What It's Like To Take A Road Trip Now<br /><br />Questions:<br />1. How would you feel when facing a strong uncertainty about the near future? How would you handle it? Do you have any experience?<br />2. So much is still up in the air when it comes to summer travel abroad. Do you have any plans of the summer breaks instead of going abroad?<br />3. Do you buy Travel Insurance and Inconvenience Insurance while traveling abroad? Why? Do you have any experience?<br />4. Do you go for local cuisine while traveling abroad?  Do you have any experience? What impressed you most?</div>
