				<div class="content">5 ways you're losing money without even realizing it, by Maurie Backman for The Motley Fool   @CNNMoney <br /><br />We all work hard for our money, so the last thing we want to do is throw any of it away. Yet a surprising number of us are kissing countless dollars goodbye due to ignorance or poor spending habits. Here are a few common sources of wasted money many of us inevitably fall victim to. <br /><br />1.	Unused gym memberships <br />Countless Americans are drawn to the gym, particularly around the new year. But that resolution to finally trim down or bulk up might not only mess with your brain, but also your wallet. While gym prices can vary depending on the type of facility you join, there's a good chance you'll end up throwing your money away on that membership. Gyms, after all, only anticipate that 18% of members will actually use them consistently, so if you're paying $50 a month for a gym that you use a handful of times a year, at best, you're essentially wasting $600 a year. Before you sign up for a gym membership, think about how often you'll actually use it and whether there's a low-cost (or better yet, free) alternative. If you own a bike, for example, riding it to work will serve as a form of exercise and, as an added bonus, save you some money on your commute. And if you're already paying a monthly fee to a gym you're rarely utilizing and you're not locked into a contract, cancel that membership, or inquire about purchasing daily passes at a fraction of your monthly cost. This way, you'll only pay for the services you're actually using. <br /><br />2. Wasted food <br />Whether it's excess produce from the local market or that bulk jar of cashews you were convinced you'd consume before its expiration date, wasting food has become such a common occurrence that many folks don't realize the extent to which they're doing it. It may therefore surprise you to learn that the average U.S. household throws out $640 of food each year, according to the American Chemistry Council. If you'd rather not toss all that food and money down the drain, make a point of creating weekly grocery lists before you hit the supermarket, and do a regular fridge, freezer, and pantry inventory to see what you already have lying around. Also, be careful when buying in bulk. Even shelf-stable items don't last forever, so limit those mass quantities to items you know you consistently use. <br /><br />3. Overspending on restaurant meals<br />It's one thing to enjoy the occasional meal out, but if you're not careful, eating at restaurants too often could result in a serious waste of money. In 2015, the average American household spent a total of $3,008 dollars on food away from home, or so reports the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But since food establishments typically charge a 300% markup on the items they serve, for every $3,000 you spend, you're paying $2,000 extra compared to what those same meals would cost you to make at home. If you're currently throwing away loads of money on restaurants and takeout, consider scaling back, especially if you're struggling to save, or have other pressing financial goals to meet. You don't need to go cold turkey, but if you cut your three typical restaurant meals a week down to two, you'll avoid wasting hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars. <br /><br />4. Retirement-plan fees <br />If you're saving for retirement in an IRA or 401(k), you're doing a smart thing for your future. But there's a drawback to these plans -- particularly the latter -- and it's the fees that come along with them. In fact, a whopping 92% of Americans don't even know how much money they're losing each year to 401(k) fees, according to a recent NerdWallet study. What many savers may not realize is that not all investments are created equal, and some are costlier than others. But if you're not careful, you could end up losing thousands of dollars in your lifetime to fees alone. Believe it or not, the average American worker who begins earning a median salary at age 25 will lose a total of $138,336 to 401(k) fees alone. To avoid falling victim to that same trap, pay attention to your investments and opt for lower-cost options, like exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as opposed to actively managed mutual funds. <br /><br />5. Sluggish investment growth <br />Just as it's essential to limit your investment fees, so, too, is it critical to put your money into vehicles that are likely to generate growth. It's estimated that 60% of Americans wind up investing too conservatively for retirement and, as such, lose out on sizable gains. Imagine you're able to set aside $300 a month for retirement starting at age 25, with the goal of retiring 40 years later. Here's what your total might look like based on the investment strategy you adopt: In the above scenario, limiting yourself to safer, low-yield investments could cause your nest egg to fall up to $715,000 short. Yikes! On the other hand, if you're willing to sink the bulk of your portfolio into stocks, which is a reasonable risk to take on if you start saving in your 20s, you stand a good chance of bringing in an average yearly 8% return, which is just below the market's average. And that could work wonders for your nest egg. <br /><br />Average yearly return <br /> ▾	Total after 40 years* <br />2% (conservative)	$217,000<br />4% (moderate)	$342,000<br />6% (moderately aggressive)	$557,000<br />8% (aggressive)	$932,000<br />In the above scenario, limiting yourself to safer, low-yield investments could cause your nest egg to fall up to $715,000 short.

And that could work wonders for your nest egg.<br /><br />Discussions:<br />1.	Are you the person who calculates carefully before spending money? Are you aware that you are losing money everyday without realizing it ? <br />2.	Did you have an unforgettable experience for over spending ?<br />3.	Do you often buy things just because it is on the sale and cheaper but you don’t need it or have never used it?<br />4.	Have you ever joined the gym as a membership or take courses, but use a handful of times a year ?<br />5.	When you eat outside or buy foods, do you always order more than you can eat and just lying around in the fridge ?<br /><br />Revealed: The world's least stressful cities(CNN)<br />If peace of mind means strolling home past trees and flowers, a fat bank balance at your disposal, and with a secure job to head to the next day, then the best place to find it is Germany. A new study has revealed the world's most and least stressful cities of 2017, based on factors including traffic levels, public transport, percentage of green spaces, financial status of citizens including debt levels, physical and mental health, and the hours of sunlight the city gets per year. Of the 150 cities ranked, four out of the top ten most stress-free cities are in Germany. The southern city of Stuttgart comes out on top, with Hanover in third place, Munich in fifth place and Hamburg in joint ninth place with Graz, Austria. The tiny yet wealthy country of Luxembourg, home to fewer than 600,000 people, has the second-lowest stress levels.Bern, Switzerland is fourth, while Bordeaux, France (No. 6) and Edinburgh, UK (No. 7) also make it to the top of the charts. Sydney, Australia (No.8) is the only non-European city to break the top ten, while Seattle is the most chill US city. <br />Greenbacks and green spaces<br />The study, by UK-based dry-cleaning and laundry service Zipjet, was conducted by studying 500 locations based on data relating to 17 categories covering infrastructure, pollution levels, finance and citizens' wellbeing. This determined a ranking of 150 cities with available data on all factors relating to the study. The city ranked the most stressful overall is Baghdad -- with a total score of 10 compared with Stuttgart's one -- followed by Kabul. Stuttgart's formula for worry-free living, meanwhile is having a strong local economy -- this is the home of Porsche, Bosch and Mercedes-Benz -- but also coming out top in the study for the highest percentage of green spaces within the city limits. The city is spread across a range of hills and valleys, some covered with vineyards. Stuttgart's generous greenery &quot;really [has] a noticeable effect on stress,&quot; says Stuttgart-based PR professional David Moos. &quot;The ability to feel less enclosed can help you in not feeling stifled, and personally I find this reduces anxiety. The feeling of security in the city, both financial and in the sense of personal safety, is also a great comfort.&quot; <br /> <br />The formula for easy living<br />Luxembourg has the lowest population density after Kuwait City, and Sydney and Melbourne (No. 6 and No. 7) are also relatively uncrowded urban spaces. Residents of Singapore and Taipei are most satisfied with their cities' public transport, while Leipzig, Germany and Montpelier, France have the lowest levels of traffic congestion. In the security category -- in which the official average rates of theft and murder are weighted against United Nations data on the local perception of security per capita -- Abu Dhabi was judged the most &quot;safe&quot; place to live by its citizens, with Osaka, Japan in second place. And while sunny weather is an instant mood-lifter all over the world, high levels of annual sunshine didn't count for much in terms of a city's overall ranking. War-torn Damascus came out top in that category, while Bordeaux -- at No. 56 -- was the sunniest city in the top ten. North America came out tops in terms of low air pollution levels, with Miami, Seattle, Vancouver and Boston leading the way. Abidjan, in the Ivory Coast, has the lowest noise pollution, while Antananarivo, Madagascar, and Reykjavik have the lowest light pollution. <br /> <br />Disposable income <br />Phnom Penh has the lowest official unemployment rates and Brunei's Bandar Seri Begawan has the lowest debt per capita, but the real measure of a city's financial health is in the Family Purchasing Power category, which balances average household salaries with the cost of living. Munich came out top by this criteria, followed by Luxembourg, Sydney, Monaco and Stuttgart. Athens scored best in the Social Security category but, with rioters taking to the street earlier this year to protest increases in tax and social security contributions, it may be what the Ancient Greeks described as a Pyrrhic victory. Luxembourg, Bordeaux and Graz performed best in the Mental Health category, while Reykjavik has the best record for Physical Health. The Icelandic capital also comes out tops when it comes to gender equality. The race equality category -- based on data from a World Bank ethnic inequality report -- is, perhaps surprisingly, topped by cities in the US. San Francisco, Boston and Seattle take the top three slots.Glamorous, global cities such as London (No. 70), Tokyo (No. 72), Paris (No. 78) clustered around the middle of the league table, with New York (No. 84) being the most stress-inducing of the big four. The study has some overlap with other recent lists, such as the world's most liveable cities, where Melbourne is No. 1, and the world's happiest countries, which is topped by Norway. But peace of mind doesn't come cheap: Sydney, Vancouver and Melbourne are also some of the world's most expensive cities.
