6/20(Sat.)World Oceans Day/sleepwalker(Host: Jason Yang)<br /><br />Article1: World Oceans Day<br /><br />World Oceans Day is a day to think about the extremely important role that the oceans play in all our lives, the dangers that are facing our oceans and the actions we can take to protect them.<br />Do the preparation task first. Then read the article and do the exercises.<br />There is only one global ocean. This is divided into five geographical regions: the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Arctic Ocean and the Southern Ocean.   <br />Introduction<br />Seventy per cent of our planet is covered by one huge, continuous body of seawater – the ocean. It holds 1.35 billion cubic kilometres of water. Nearly half of the ocean is more than 3 kilometres deep. The deepest known point of the ocean is in the Mariana Trench, 11 kilometres below sea level. But there may be deeper points that we have not seen, as we have only explored five per cent of the ocean to date.<br />World Oceans Day<br />The government of Canada suggested the idea of World Oceans Day at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. In 2008 the United Nations officially recognised the date and it has been growing ever since, from 100 events in 2008 to over a thousand events in more than 120 countries ten years later. The day is celebrated in a variety of ways, including special events at aquariums and zoos, beach and river clean-ups, school activities, conservation programmes, art contests and film festivals.<br />The importance of our oceans<br />One of the main aims of the day is to remind people of the important role the ocean plays in our lives. Life began in the ocean. And the ocean is home to the majority of plants and animals on Earth, from single-cell organisms to the blue whale. Marine plants provide us with 70 per cent of the oxygen we breathe. The ocean controls the climate, providing heat in winter and cool air in summer. It also provides us with food and medicines as well as transport. No matter where you live on the planet, no matter how far from the sea, your life is dependent on the ocean.<br />The problems facing our oceans<br />The most urgent problem facing the ocean at the moment is plastic pollution. Reducing one-use plastic, including plastic bags and plastic bottles, has been an important theme for World Oceans Day for a number of years. Climate change and rising sea temperatures are also a huge problem. Rising sea temperatures have a direct influence on weather patterns and are seen as partly responsible for an increase in extreme weather conditions. An increase in carbon dioxide is increasing the acid levels of seawater and putting many marine organisms at risk.  <br />What we can do to help<br />On World Oceans Day, wear blue, go on a march, find a beach or river clean-up near you, organise a local event, print a poster and put it in your window, or use the hashtag #worldoceansday on social media. There are so many things you can do on 8 June to join in the celebrations, to remind people about the importance of the ocean in our lives and to make a difference!<br /><br />Question:<br />1. What role does the ocean play in your life?<br />2. What would you prefer to do to celebrate World Oceans Day?<br />3. Did you dive into the ocean before? <br />4. How can we protect our ocean in the world?<br /><br />Article2: sleepwalker<br />you've probably seen a cartoon character walking with closed eyes and outstretched arms. It's a silly but effective way to portray sleepwalkers. in real life, though, sleepwalking is a disorder characterized by action that can be strange and sometimes even dangerous.<br />the scientific name for sleepwalking is somnambulism. this means that a person in a sleep-like state does things such as a walk around, clean the house, or even drive a car. the episodes can last from a few minutes to longer than 30 minutes.<br />in some actual cases, one person cooked a three-course meal, a second simply took a shower, and a third person painted the walls of his living room. one woman logged on to her computer and sent out three e-mail inviting friends over for a special dinner. the messages were very unusual, and those that received them were left baffled.<br />sleepwalking affects about one to two percent of the population, but what causes people to sleepwalk is a mystery. some doctors say that it is a genetic sleep disorder that seems to run in certain families. others say that stress and anxiety are responsible factors. a few doctors believe that sleepwalking occurs because of a combination of genetic and psychological factors.<br />contrary to popular belief, a person who is sleepwalking is not dreaming or acting out a dream. a sleepwalker is in a non-dream stage of sleep, and the things he is processing in his brain come out in his words and actions. the person is usually slow to reply to question, and his eyes are open and might appear glazed.<br />according to doctors, people who sleepwalk will wake with no memory of what they have done in their sleep. surprisingly, people have been acquitted of crimes after sleepwalking was used as a defense. the first example of this in America occurred in 1846 when a man was found not guilty of murder and arson because he had been sleepwalking at the time. since then, this defense has been used a number of times.<br />one myth about sleepwalking is that if you wake sleepwalkers, it could kill them. waking sleepwalkers was once believed to cause them to suffer heart attacks or shock. this is not true, and the greatest danger sleepwalker pose is accidentally hurting themselves during an episode.<br />for people who encounter sleepwalkers, it is recommended not to wake them unless they are doing something dangerous. its best to just safely lead them back to bed. they won't remember your help in the morning, but at least they'll get a good night's sleep.<br /><br />Question:<br />1. Are you a sleepwalker?<br />2. did u have any sleepwalker experience?<br />3. If your friend are sleepwalker, how would you do?<br />4. What is the difference about sleepwalker in movies and real life?<br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00 ~ 7:30 pm greetings &amp; free talk<br />7:30 ~ 8:15 pm guests introduced &amp; first session discussion<br />8:15 ~ 8:45 pm presentation, sharing the article &amp; other experiences<br />8:45 ~ 9:30 pm second session discussion<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven,<br />板橋民生路二段237 號,<br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30,<br />a minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12531">Danny Lin</a> — Thu Jun 18, 2020 9:59 am</p><hr />
