			<div class="content">04/06(Sat.) Five ways you could become a memory champion /Mushrooms may 'reduce the risk of mild brain decline' (Host: Ivonne)<br /><br /><br />Article I : Five ways you could become a memory champion<br />LINK: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190329-five-ways-you-could-become-a-memory-champion">http://www.bbc.com/future/story/2019032 ... y-champion</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Frustrated at forgetting stuff? Some simple tricks could have dramatic positive effects.<br /><br />Most of us wish we had better memories. If only we didn’t get to the shop, knowing we must buy three things, but only remembering two. If only we didn’t go upstairs, only to forget why we went up there. If only we could read information and take it all in easily, instead of it disappearing quickly from our minds.<br /><br />There are plenty of tried and trusted memory techniques, some of which have been around for decades – such as the use of the mnemonics and memory places. But what are scientists looking at now? More research will be needed before we can be certain of the best ways of putting these in practice, but what can the newest research tell us about the kinds of techniques we might see more of in the future?<br /><br />1)	Walk backwards<br /><br />We might think of time and space as very different things, but even in the way we talk there is more crossover than we might realise. We put events “behind us”. We “look forward” to the weekend. The exact way we do it varies with culture, but in the Western world most of us think of the future as stretching out in space in front of us while the past stretches out behind us.<br />Researchers at the University of Roehampton decided to exploit this link in our minds between time and space to find a way to help us to remember events better.<br /><br />You might also like:<br />●Five myths about coping with the cold<br />●Five myths about broken bones<br />●The surprising truth about loneliness<br /><br />They showed people a list of words, a set of pictures or a staged video of a woman’s handbag being stolen. The people were instructed to walk either forwards or backwards 10m (33ft) across a room in time with a ticking metronome. When they were tested afterwards on their memory for the video, the words and the pictures, in each test the backwards-walkers remembered more.<br />It was as though walking backwards in space encouraged their mind to go back in time and the result was that they could access their memories more easily.<br />It even worked when they just imagined going backwards, rather than physically doing it. This 2018 research fits in with some intriguing research done with rats in 2006. When rats learn to navigate their way around a maze, neurons called place cells fire at each location. The researchers found that as the rats pause in a maze, the neurons associated with each location they’ve learned along the route, fire in reverse order. So going backwards in their minds helps them to remember the correct route.<br />And now brand new research has shown that when we humans remember a past event we reconstruct the experience in our minds in reverse order. When we first see an object we notice the patterns and the colours first and then work out what it is. When we try to remember an object it happens the other way round; we remember the object first and then, if we’re lucky, the details.  <br /><br />2) Do a drawing  <br />How about drawing your shopping list instead of writing the items down? In 2018 a group of younger and older people were given a list of words to learn. Half were asked to do a drawing of each of the words, while the other half were instructed to write the words down while they learned them. Later the people were tested to see how many words they could remember. Even though some of the words were very tricky to draw, such as “isotope”, the act of drawing made such a difference that the older people became as good as the younger people at recalling the words. Drawing even made a difference in people with dementia.<br /><br />When we draw something we are forced to consider in more detail and it’s this deeper processing that makes us more likely to remember it. Even writing a list helps a bit, which is why when you get to the shop and realise you’ve left your shopping list at home, you can still remember more items than if you hadn’t written a list at all. Doing a drawing takes it one step further.  <br />And if those of you who are good at Pictionary are thinking this technique might work even better for you, you’ll be disappointed. The quality of the drawing made no difference.  <br />3) Do some exercise, but get the timing right<br />It’s been known for some time that aerobic exercise such as running can improve your memory. Regular exercise has a small general effect, but when you want to learn something in particular then a one-off bout of exertion does seem to help, at least in the short-term. <br /><br />But research suggests that if we get the timing just right, the memory boost might be even stronger. People who did 35 minutes of interval training four hours after learning a list of pictures paired with locations were better at remembering the pairs than those who did the interval training straight away.<br />In the future researchers will be working out exactly when exercise is most beneficial which might vary depending on the kind of things you’re trying to remember.<br /><br /><br />4) Do nothing<br />When people experiencing amnesia as the result of a stroke were given a list of 15 words to memorise and then given another task to do, 10 minutes later, they could remember just 14% of that original list of words But if instead they sat in a darkened room doing nothing at all for 15 minutes, their score rose to an impressive 49%.  <br /><br />The same technique has been used in various studies since by Michaela Dewar at Herriot Watt University. She found that in healthy people a short break straight after learning something even made a difference to how much they could remember a whole week later. Now you may be thinking, but how do we know that the people didn’t spend that 10 minutes in a darkened room cunningly repeating the words to themselves so they didn’t forget. To prevent this Dewar cleverly had people memorise hard to pronounce words in a foreign language which they couldn’t possibly repeat to themselves.  <br /><br />These studies show us just how fragile new memories are, so fragile that even a short break can make a difference to whether they hang around or disappear.<br />5) Take a nap<br />If walking backwards, drawing, exercising or even taking a break sounds too much like hard work, how about taking a quick nap? Sleep is thought to help consolidate our memories by replaying or reactivating the information we’ve just learned and that sleep doesn’t have to happen at night. Researchers in Germany found that when people were given pairs of words to memorise, they could recall more of them after a sleep of up to 90 minutes then after watching a film.   <br /><br />But very recent research suggests this technique works best in people who are accustomed to regularly taking a nap in the afternoon. This led Elizabeth McDevitt and her team at the University of California Riverside to wonder whether it was possible to train people to nap. So for four weeks the non-nappers took to their beds for a daytime snooze when they could.<br />Unfortunately for these people the naps still didn’t boost their memories. So maybe a longer training period is needed or perhaps there are some people who just need to walk backwards, draw, run or simply do nothing instead.<br /><br />Discussions~~ <br /><br />Q1) Why the backwards-walkers remembered more? please share with us your experiences. <br /><br />Q2)To improve memory, do you have any experienced effective ways? <br /><br />Q3) why drawing can make it memorable? please give some instances. <br /><br />Q4) do you know what kind of exercise helpful improve our memory? <br /><br />Q5) why simply do nothing can boost our memories?<br /><br />Article II: Mushrooms may 'reduce the risk of mild brain decline'<br />LINK: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-47554966">https://www.bbc.com/news/health-47554966</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Eating mushrooms more than twice a week could prevent memory and language problems occurring in the over-60s, research from Singapore suggests.<br />A unique antioxidant present in mushrooms could have a protective effect on the brain, the study found.<br />The more mushrooms people ate, the better they performed in tests of thinking and processing.<br />But researchers said it was not possible to prove a direct link between the fungi and brain function.<br />The National University of Singapore study's findings were based on 663 Chinese adults, aged over 60, whose diet and lifestyle were tracked from 2011 to 2017.<br />Over the six-year study, the researchers found that eating mushrooms lowered the chances of mild cognitive impairment, so that roughly nine out of 100 people who ate more than two portions a week were diagnosed, compared with 19 out of 100 among those who ate fewer than one portion.<br />'Encouraging'<br />Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can make people forgetful, affect their memory and cause problems with language, attention and locating objects in spaces - but the changes can be subtle.<br />It is not serious enough to be defined as dementia.<br />The participants in the study were asked how often they ate six different types of mushrooms: oyster, shiitake, white button, dried, golden and tinned.<br />Mushroom eaters performed better in brain tests and were found to have faster processing speed - and this was particularly noticeable in those who ate more than two portions a week, or more than 300g (10.5oz).<br />&quot;This correlation is surprising and encouraging,&quot; said assistant professor Lei Feng, the lead study author, from the university's department of psychological medicine.<br /><br />&quot;It seems that a commonly available single ingredient could have a dramatic effect on cognitive decline.<br />&quot;But we are talking about a combination of many factors - tea, green leafy vegetables, nuts and fish are also beneficial.&quot;<br />The researchers point to the fact that mushrooms are one of the richest dietary sources of ergothioneine - an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory which humans are unable to make on their own.<br />Mushrooms also contain other important nutrients and minerals such as vitamin D, selenium and spermidine, which protect neurons from damage.<br />But there is still a long way to go before evidence of a direct link can be established.<br />Diet and lifestyle factors<br />This study relied on self-reported information on mushroom intake and other dietary factors, which may not be accurate, the researchers acknowledged.<br />Dr James Pickett, head of research at Alzheimer's Society, said: &quot;There are lots of factors that contribute to the development of dementia and it's estimated that up to a third of cases could be prevented by changes in lifestyle, including diet.<br />&quot;Dementia is one of the top 10 causes of death, but people can take action to reduce their risk, so it's important that we base our advice on consistent evidence that's built up over multiple studies, and don't get carried away with the findings of any one single study.<br />&quot;So while eating a diet full of fruit and vegetables, including mushrooms, is a great starting point, our best advice is to also cut down on sugar and salt, be physically active, drink in moderation and avoid smoking.&quot;<br />The study is published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.<br /><br />Discussions~ <br /><br />Q1) what kind the mushroom gourmet you like? how to cook it? <br /><br />Q2) Why poor vision and hearing decline our cognitive abilities? <br /><br />Q3) To keep our brains healthy, how to lower the chances of cognitive impairment? <br /><br />Q4) what’s the difference between dementia &amp; mind brain decline? <br /><br />Q5) what kind the important nutrients and minerals contained in Mushroom?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:25pm discussion session <br />8:25 ~ 8:30pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:30 ~9:30pm discussion session<br />(Session III)<br />9:30 pm Free talk<br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
