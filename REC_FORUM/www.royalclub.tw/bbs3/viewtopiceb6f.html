In second place was Mexico, with Costa Rica, Malaysia, Portugal, New Zealand, Australia, Ecuador, Canada, and Vietnam rounding out the top 10.<br />The list was generated by a January survey that asked 12,420 expats representing 174 nationalities in 186 countries and regions to rate various aspects of their lives abroad. A total of 37 factors grouped under four major indices were assessed, including Quality of Life, Ease of Settling In, Working Abroad, and Personal Finance.<br />For a destination to be listed under one of the indices and in the overall ranking, there had to be at least 50 participants living there. In the case of Taiwan, the country ranked first in both the Quality of Life and Working Abroad indices.<br />Taiwan was rated well ahead of global averages for job security (83 percent vs. 61 percent), state of the local economy (85 percent vs. 62 percent globally), happiness with one's job (75 percent vs. 68 percent), and life in general (80 percent vs. 75 percent). In addition, expats in Taiwan rated the quality of their host country's medical care very highly at 96 percent (vs. 71 percent globally), and 94 percent were pleased with Taiwan's affordability (compared with 68 percent globally).<br />The expat guide cited a Chilean resident as saying that the Taiwanese healthcare system &quot;truly considers people as human beings instead of mere numbers.&quot; Expats also reported feeling extraordinarily safe in the East Asian nation, with none saying they felt personally unsafe (vs. 8 percent globally).<br />Taiwan ranked slightly lower in the Ease of Settling index in 13th place. However, in the Friendliness subcategory, Taiwan took first place, with a majority of expats finding it easy to make friends (62 percent vs. 48 percent globally) and considering Taiwanese to be &quot;friendly towards foreign residents&quot; (96 percent vs. 67 percent globally).<br /><br />Q1: Do you agree with the article mentioned that “Taiwan ranked No. 1 in world for expats”? Why or why not? Have you ever worked in other country? Can you compare it with Taiwan? <br /><br />Q2: From the article, it showed that Taiwan was rated well ahead of global averages for job security, happiness with one's job, and life in general. In your point of view, do you think what are Taiwan’s attractions and advantages? If you are the worldwide expats, which country will you choose and why? What reason do you consider most?<br /><br />Q3: According to the article, expats in Taiwan rated the quality of their host country's medical care very highly at 96 percent, how do you think about Taiwan’s health care policy? Do you think if there is any improvement of Taiwan’s health care policy (pros and cons)?<br /><br />Article 2: What we can learn from the Eastern Med about breakfast<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/articles/eastern_med_breakfast">https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/articles/eas ... _breakfast</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Q1: How do you think about Eastern Mediterranean breakfast? Have you ever tried it and where did you taste it? And do you like it? <br /><br />Q2: From the articles, do you think beans, olive, and yogurt are good for health? What other food do you think it’s good to the health and suitable for breakfast?<br /><br />Q3: Do you like western style or Taiwanese style breakfast? What do you usually eat for your breakfast? Do you buy the breakfast outside or you make it by yourself at home?<br /><br />Q4: Some scientists say skipping breakfast or having it later could benefit your gut bacteria, do you agree with this point of view? Do you eat breakfast everyday? If you skip the breakfast, do you feel any uncomfortable? How will you deal with the situation?<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #0000FF">P.S.<br />1.參加三次後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />2.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~</span></div>
