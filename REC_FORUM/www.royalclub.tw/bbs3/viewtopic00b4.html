				<div class="content">The young and the old<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Session I: buy a house or travel abroad?</span><br /><br />Please read the article cited from CNBC and join the meeting to share your ideas in English: Young people aren’t buying homes because they’d rather travel the world<br /><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/07/millennials-would-rather-travel-than-buy-a-home.html" class="postlink">https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/07/millennials-would-rather-travel-than-buy-a-home.html</a><br /><br />Millennials aren't buying homes at the same rate as previous generations, and homeownership rates for those under 35 have steadily declined since the early 2000s.<br /><br />One reason for this shift: Young people today have different priorities.<br /><br />According to a recent survey by Realty Mogul, 47 percent of young people between the ages of 18 and 34 would rather spend their money on traveling than buying a house, compared to only 26 percent of those ages 45 and older who said the same.<br /><br />This holds true to an opinion millennial consumers have expressed for years: Experiences matter more than things.<br /><br />A 2014 Eventbrite poll found that 78 percent of millennials would choose to spend money on a desirable event over a desirable purchase and 55 percent said that they're spending more on experiences than they ever have, CNBC reports.<br /><br />Millennials &quot;aren't spending our money on cars, TVs and watches,&quot; Taylor Smith, CEO and co-founder of Blueboard, tells CNBC. &quot;We're renting scooters and touring Vietnam, rocking out at music festivals, or hiking Machu Picchu.<br /><br />Young people also prioritize small luxuries, such as restaurant meals, daily Starbucks runs and, of course, avocado toast. Forty-seven percent of respondents ages 18 to 34 told Realty Mogul they'd prefer to rent over buy if it meant they could still afford such indulgences.<br /><br />But although finances alone aren't the only thing holding young people back from home ownership, cost remains a major factor in whether or not they choose to buy.<br /><br />Home prices keep rising while wages have remained largely flat. So, recent data from Apartment List shows, although 80 percent of millennials would like to purchase real estate, very few young people are in a good position to buy.<br /><br />According to the report, &quot;68 percent of millennials said they have saved less than $1,000 for a down payment. Almost half, or 44 percent, of millennials said they have not saved anything for a down payment.&quot;<br /><br />While an indulgent vacation may set a millennial back a few thousand dollars, the cost of owning a house is vastly higher. A 20 percent down payment on a $200,000 home would cost $40,000 alone, before closing costs, maintenance and other the other expensive elements of home ownership even come into play.<br /><br />Additionally, many millennials, it seems, don't fully grasp how expensive real estate has become, especially in desirable cities. If they push saving for a house to the back-burner in favor of spending money on travel, many might be in for a rude awakening when it comes time to start working toward a down payment.<br /><br />As Apartment List reports: &quot;In Los Angeles, the market with the widest gap in expectation and reality, the actual median price of a condo is $420,400, meaning that a 20 percent down payment comes out to $84,080. Respondents in that region estimated that they will need $36,340, which is less than half of the actual amount.&quot;<br /><br />There's no rule that young people can't travel and purchase real estate, but those who do want to make home ownership a reality should start saving. After all, you can never put away too much.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />*********************************<br />1.     What are the pros and cons of buying a house and traveling the world, respectively? Which one gets higher priority for you in your life? <br />2.	Why would young people rather spend money to travel the world instead of saving money to buy a house?<br />3.	Do you worry about the future of our younger generation in Taiwan? Why or why not??<br />4.	How do you see the current problems and the future of Taiwan?<br />*********************************<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Session II: Should we end aging forever?</span><br /><br />Human beings are destined to die, and more and more old people in the world now.

Are you afraid of aging and being old? Why or why not?<br />2. 	If you watched the videos, please summarize what you have learned and share it with other table members. What is the difference between stop ageing and live forever, and what are the problems of current medical system on life extension?  <br />3.	How old do you wish to live? Which kind of life do you want to live before you die? Have you begun to prepare for it, and how?<br />4.	There are only two options for you: (1) You can live for more than 200 years old, but all your families and friends can only live until 100 (this means you have no loved one after 100 years old); (2) You and all your loved ones live less than 90 years. Which one do you prefer and why?<br />*********************************<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Agenda</span><br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />8:10 ~ 8:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:25 ~ 8:30pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:30 ~9:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~9:30pm Concluding remarks/feedback from newcomers<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The meeting place of Thursday:</span><br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第一區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
