			<div class="content">Article 1: 4 Science-Backed Health Benefits of Eating Organic<br />By AMANDA MACMILLAN AND JULIA NAFTULIN <br />July 27, 2017 <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://time.com/4871915/health-benefits-organic-food/">http://time.com/4871915/health-benefits-organic-food/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The organic food industry is a booming business, and with the recent sale of natural-foods giant Whole Foods to Amazon, it’s expected to grow even larger in the near future. While some consumers buy organic because they believe it’s better for the environment, even more do so for health-related reasons, according to one 2016 survey.<br /><br />What, exactly, are the health benefits of going organic? That depends on who you ask and which studies you consult. But if you do choose to buy organic foods, here are some science-backed bonuses you’re likely to get in return.<br /><br />Fewer pesticides and heavy metals<br /><br />Fruits, vegetables and grains labeled organic are grown without the use of most synthetic pesticides or artificial fertilizers. (The National Organic Standard Board does allow some synthetic substances to be used.) While such chemicals have been deemed safe in the quantities used for conventional farming, health experts still warn about the potential harms of repeated exposure.<br /><br />For example, the commonly used herbicide Roundup has been classified as a “probable human carcinogen,” and the insecticide chlorpyrifos has been associated with developmental delays in infants. Studies have also suggested that pesticide residues—at levels commonly found in the urine of kids in the U.S.—may contribute to ADHD prevalence; they’ve also been linked to reduced sperm quality in men.<br /><br />A 2014 meta-analysis in the British Journal of Nutrition found that organically grown crops were not only less likely to contain detectable levels of pesticides, but because of differences in fertilization techniques, they were also 48% less likely to test positive for cadmium, a toxic heavy metal that accumulates in the liver and kidneys.<br /><br />More healthy fats<br /><br />When it comes to meat and milk, organic products can have about 50% more omega-3 fatty acids, a type of unsaturated healthy fat, than conventionally produced products, according to a 2016 study in the British Journal of Nutrition. Organic milk tested in the study also had less saturated fat than non-organic.<br /><br />These differences may come from the way organic livestock is raised, with a grass-fed diet and more time spent outdoors, say the study’s authors. They believe that switching from conventional to organic products would raise consumers’ omega-3 intake without increasing overall calories or saturated fat.<br /><br />No antibiotics or synthetic hormones<br /><br />Conventional livestock can be fed antibiotics to protect against illness, making it easier for farmers to raise animals in crowded or unsanitary conditions. The FDA limited the use of certain antibiotics for livestock earlier this year, but loopholes in the legislation still exist. And with the exception of poultry, conventionally raised animals can also be injected with synthetic growth hormones, so they’ll gain weight faster or produce more milk.<br /><br />But traces of these substances can make their way to consumers, says Rolf Halden, professor and director of the Biodesign Center for Environmental Security at Arizona State University. Drug residue is believed to contribute to widespread antibiotic resistance, he says, and organic foods—which are produced without antibiotics—“are intrinsically safer in this respect.” Organic meat and dairy also cannot contain synthetic hormones, which have been linked to an increased risk of cancer.<br /><br />More antioxidants, in some cases<br /><br />In a recent six-year study in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, researchers found that organic onions had about a 20% higher antioxidant content than conventionally grown onions. They also theorized that previous analyses—several of which have found no difference in conventional versus organic antioxidant levels—may have been thwarted by too-short study periods and confounding variables like weather.<br /><br />The research was “very well done,” says Guy Crosby, adjunct associate professor of Nutrition at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health. But he points out that this specific study “takes just one aspect of phytochemicals and shows they can be improved under organic conditions.” The question of whether organic foods are truly more nutritious is still debatable, he adds. “Had the researchers chosen to measure a different vitamin or mineral, they may have found a different result.”<br /><br />The bottom line<br /><br />Organic products are more expensive than conventional ones, and whether they’re really worth the extra cost is certainly a matter of choice. “If you can afford all organic, that’s fantastic, but it’s not feasible for most people,” says registered dietitian Cynthia Sass. “If it’s not, the most important groups to buy organic, in my opinion, include foods you eat daily and produce on the Dirty Dozen list—those with the highest pesticide residues.” If people eat eggs, dairy and meat, she also recommends buying those organic.<br /><br />Halden says that vulnerable groups—including pregnant women, young children, the elderly and people suffering from allergies—may benefit the most from choosing organically produced foods. He also points out that a strictly organic diet can still be plenty unhealthy: “Eating too much sugar and meat and too few vegetables is risky, regardless of whether the shopper picks from the conventional or organic grocery selection,” he says.<br /><br />It’s also important for consumers to make educated decisions about why they choose to buy organic, says Crosby—and not to get hung up on individual studies that haven’t been supported by additional research. If you’re trying to reduce exposure to pesticide residues, organic is a good choice, he says. “On the other hand, if you’re buying them because they’re more nutritious, the evidence doesn’t broadly support that,” he says.<br /><br />Discussion:<br /><br />1.	How much do you know about organic foods?  Pls share your knowledge with us.<br />2.	Do you buy organic foods?  Why or why not?<br />3.	Do you think whether it’s worthy to spend more money to eat organic?<br />4.	Do you believe eating organic is healthier?<br />5.	Do you think organic food industry is a booming industry, and will grow larger and larger in the future?<br /><br /><br />Article 2: The “90% Rule” that puts you 100% in control of everything.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/32424?ref=business">https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/32424?ref=business</a><!-- m --><br />  <br />Hey, it’s Marie Forleo and you are watching Marie TV, the place to be to create a business and a life that you love. You know, recently I came across this quote from Mr. Chuck Swindoll and it really lit me up. Now, it’s something that I’ve heard before but for whatever reason this time it really sank in.  He says, “Life is 10% what happens to me, and 90% how I react to it.” Pretty powerful, right? Because the fact is that things happen to us each and every day that we have no control over. I mean, planes get delayed, we get sick, the internet goes out in the midst of a huge project, we lose businesses, we lose jobs, and, unfortunately, we lose people that we love. Our lives radically change often at times whether we want them to or not. And ultimately, the impact that any outside situation has on your life depends on how you react or respond to it. So let’s go back to this quote one more time. Life is 10% what happens to me, and 90% how I react to it.” That means that as a factor of how your life goes and how good it is, what happens to you is this tiny little sliver of your life pie. (Life pie) I wanted to share this here because I believe that this is one of those major life lessons, one of those critical truths that if you really, really get it, it can radically alter the quality and the trajectory of your life. I mean, it can save your business, it can save your marriage, it can be the difference between failure and success in pretty much any endeavor and ultimately whether or not you reach your highest potential. Now, this idea is something that I personally am always working on getting better at, and today I wanted to share 3 ways that you could bring this rule to life, especially when the shiitake hits the fan.<br /><br />Number one is hold that tongue. When I’m fired up and I am in reaction mode, I have to hold my tongue. I need to give myself a chance to really feel what I’m feeling, to actually process what’s happening, and think through my response. Otherwise if I react and let that fired up Jersey girl out immediately, chances are I’m gonna make what should be a minor situation into a big, hot, fat mess. That is why I’m such a huge fan of meditation. Meditation really gives you the power to be<br />less reactive in life. You’re gonna have more control over your ability to chill out and hold your tongue so when you’re ready you can actually respond more thoughtfully and appropriately.<br /><br />Number two is check yourself. So a simple practice when something unexpected happens in life and you are tempted to freak out is to stop and check yourself. Ask, “Am I ok in this moment? Am I breathing? Is my heart beating? Is the ground still underneath my feet?” If you can say yes to all three, that means you are really ok right now and in some ways now is all there is. So for me if I get penne on a brand new white comforter or I get a flat tire on the way to the airport or if I get a text that my dad is in the hospital, before I freak out and react to what’s happening around me, I really try and practice and stop and ask myself, “Am I ok in this moment?” And so far, thankfully, the answer has always been yes. And when I’m ok in this moment, my responses to whatever is happening come from a much more grounded and effective place.<br /><br />Number three: say, “And this is what I want.” So I learned this little mantra from my man Josh and it’s something that he says often in his Committed Impulse class, specifically when he’s making you do these crazy squats up on your tippy toes that make your legs shake uncontrollably. One caveat, this tool is super effective for pretty much everything besides tragedy level events. I’m talking about traffic jams and tech trouble and lost credit cards and stuff like that. It doesn't really apply to those heartbreaking and devastating events that all of us have to face in our life. But saying, “and this is what I want,” either out loud or in your head is a really effective way to reframe what you consider negative or out of your control. So for example, there’s drilling outside my house and I’ve got to write all day, and this is what I want. Or it’s raining on my wedding day, and this is what I want. This little mantra trains your brain to fully embrace whatever is happening in each moment and really own it as though you wanted it, which puts you in complete control of that magical 90% of your life pie.<br /><br />So I want to wrap up today with a great passage from our friend Chuck Swindoll that really brings this idea home. “Attitude is more important than facts. It is more important than the past, than education, money, circumstances, than failures and success, than what other people think, say, or do. It is more important than appearance, ability, or skill. It will make or break a business, a home, a friendship, an organization... The remarkable thing is I have a choice every day of what my attitude will be. I cannot change my past. I cannot change the actions of others. I cannot change the inevitable. The only thing I can change is attitude. Life is ten percent what happens to me and ninety percent how I react to it.”<br /><br />Discussion:<br /><br />1.	“Life is 10% what happens to me, and 90% how I react to it.”  The author provided 3 methods to bring this rule to life.  Pls pick one method to share your opinion and experience with us.<br />2.	How do you usually react to something unexpected happens to you?  <br />3.	What’s a specific area in your life that a shift in your attitude, not circumstance, could make the greatest positive impact?</div>
