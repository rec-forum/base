				<div class="content">9/15(Sat.) With rising sea levels, Bangkok struggles to stay afloat<br /> &amp; How Venezuela's crisis developed and drove out millions of people (Host: Willaim)<br /><br />With rising sea levels, Bangkok struggles to stay afloat<br />海平面上升 曼谷岌岌可危, Sep 05, 2018, Taipei Times <br />As Bangkok hosted climate-change talks yesterday, the sprawling city of more than 10 million is itself under siege from the environment, with dire forecasts warning it could be partially submerged in just over a decade. A preparatory meeting begins Tuesday in Thailand’s capital for the next UN climate conference, a crunch summit in Poland at the end of 2018 to set rules on reducing greenhouse emissions and providing aid to vulnerable countries. As temperatures rise, abnormal weather patterns — like more powerful cyclones [including typhoons and hurricanes], erratic rainfall, and intense droughts and floods — are predicted to worsen over time, adding pressure on governments tasked with bringing the 2015 Paris climate treaty to life. Bangkok, built on once-marshy land about 1.5m above sea level, is projected to be one of the world’s hardest hit urban areas, alongside fellow Southeast Asian behemoths Jakarta and Manila. “Nearly 40 percent” of Bangkok will be inundated by as early as 2030 due to extreme rainfall and changes in weather patterns, according to a World Bank report. Seas in the nearby Gulf of Thailand are rising by four millimeters a year, above the global average. In 2011, when the monsoon season brought the worst floods in decades, a fifth of the city was under water. The business district was spared thanks to hastily constructed dikes. But the rest of Thailand was not so fortunate and the death toll passed 500 by the end of the season.<br />Experts say unchecked urbanization and eroding shorelines will leave Bangkok and its residents in a critical situation. With the weight of skyscrapers contributing to the city’s gradual descent into water, Bangkok has become a victim of its own frenetic development. Shrimp farms and other aquacultural development — sometimes replacing mangrove forests that protected against storm surges — have also caused significant erosion to the coastline nearest the capital. This means that Bangkok could be penned in by flooding from the sea in the south and monsoon floods from the north, said Suppakorn Chinvanno, a climate expert at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok. Narong Raungsri, director of Bangkok’s Department of Drainage and Sewage, admitted that the city’s “weaknesses” stem from its small tunnels and the hyper-development of neighborhoods. Today, the government is scrambling to mitigate the effects of climate change, constructing a municipal canal network of up to 2,600km with pumping stations and eight underground tunnels to evacuate water if disaster strikes.But these ad-hoc fixes may not be enough. “We need a clear policy of land management,” said Greenpeace’s Tara Buakamsri, adding that the need for increased green spaces is outweighed by developers’ interests. “The high price of land in Bangkok makes economic interests a priority.”                           <br />Discussions:  <br />1. Have you ever visited Bangkok? Share us the stories about your visit.                      <br />2.  Except Bangkok, built on once-marshy land about 1.5m above sea level, do you know   which cities that also meet the same problems ?<br />3.  With the rising of the temperatures and abnormal weather patterns,the extreme weather happens repeatedly— like the powerful typhoons hit Japan and destroyed Kansai Airport. Have you ever thought that it might happen somewhere around us one day ?         <br />4.  After Typhoon Jebi, the worst typhoon in 25 years wreaked havoc in Japan’s Kansai region last week, a lot of people might begin to think whether human being could overcome the nature. What do you think ?                                                           <br /><br /><br />How Venezuela's crisis developed and drove out millions of people , BBC News , 22 August 2018<br />Venezuela's economy is in freefall. Hyperinflation, power cuts, and food and medicine shortages are driving millions of Venezuelans out of the country. Many are blaming President Nicolás Maduro and his government for the dire state the nation is in. Here, BBC News takes a closer look at how Venezuela's economy descended into its current crisis.<br />What's wrong with Venezuela?<br />Arguably the biggest problem facing Venezuelans in their day-to-day lives is hyperinflation. The annual inflation rate reached 83,000% in July, according to a recent study by the opposition-controlled National Assembly. Prices have been doubling every 26 days on average. This has resulted in many Venezuelans struggling to afford basic items such as food and toiletries. With small items like a cup of coffee costing a whopping 2.5m bolivars until recently, it also became increasingly difficult to pay for goods in cash. Until the currency's redenomination on 20 August, Venezuelans needed 25 of their highest denomination notes - the 100,000 bolivar bill - to pay for their caffeine fix. To avoid going shopping with rucksacks full of cash, Venezuelans increasingly started using electronic transfers for even the smallest transactions. As the BBC's South American correspondent found in Caracas, waiters handed customers their bank details trusting that the latter would transfer them the tip electronically.<br />How did hyperinflation come about?                                               On the most basic level, there are more people wanting to purchase goods than the number of goods available. Venezuela is rich in oil, and has the largest proven reserves in the world. But arguably it's this exact wealth that underpins many of its economic problems. Because it has so much oil, Venezuela has never bothered to produce much else. It sells oil to other countries, and with the dollars it earns, imports the goods Venezuelans want and need from abroad. Its oil revenues account for about 95% of its export earnings. But when the oil price plummeted in 2014, Venezuela was faced with a shortfall of foreign currency. This in turn made it difficult to import goods at the same level as before, and imported items became scarcer. The result: businesses increased prices and inflation rose. Add to that the government's willingness to print extra money and regularly hike the minimum wage in an effort to regain popularity with Venezuela's poor, and you get money which loses its worth rapidly. The government is also increasingly struggling to get credit after it defaulted on some of its government bonds. With creditors less likely to take the risk of investing in Venezuela, the government has again taken to printing more money, further undermining its value and stoking inflation. <br />What's the government doing about it?<br />The government lopped five zeros off the old &quot;strong bolivar&quot; currency on 20 August and gave it a new name - the &quot;sovereign bolivar&quot;. It also began circulating eight new banknotes worth 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 sovereign bolivars and two new coins. The new currency is part of an &quot;economic package&quot; of measures which the government says is the &quot;magic formula&quot; to help Venezuela's battered economy recover. <br />Among the measures are:<br />	Raising the minimum wage to 34 times its previous level from 1 September<br />	Anchoring the sovereign bolivar to the petro, a virtual currency the government says is linked to Venezuela's oil reserves<br />	Curbing Venezuela's generous fuel subsidies for those not in possession of a &quot;Fatherland ID&quot;<br />	Raising VAT by 4% to 16%<br />How are people reacting?<br />Many people have been voting with their feet and leaving Venezuela. According to United Nations figures, 2.3 million Venezuelans have left the country since 2014 when the economic crisis started to bite. The majority have crossed into neighbouring Colombia, from where some move on to Ecuador, Peru and Chile. Others have gone south to Brazil. Venezuela has also seen more than 200,000 of its citizens emigrate to Spain. Many of them are the children of Spaniards who came to Venezuela in the 1950s and 60s, when it was seen as a place of opportunity. The mass migration is one of the largest forced displacement in the western hemisphere.<br />What faces those staying in Venezuela?<br />While the new currency is likely to make cash transactions easier for a while, its introduction caused confusion. Some Venezuelans managed to get hold of the new bills, but others reported long queues when banks opened. Some economists have also warned that the new currency could soon face the same problems as the old one unless the root causes of hyperinflation are tackled. They say that within months its worth could be decimated by rising prices. Employers have also said that they do not know how they will pay for the 34-fold rise in the minimum wage. Meanwhile, shoppers still face empty shelves in supermarkets, and in some cities there have been water shortages and power cuts caused by a lack of investment in Venezuela's crumbling infrastructure. But while the power cuts and lack of running water are a problem for households and businesses, they have proven deadly in Venezuela's already run-down public hospitals. Many of those fleeing the country say they are doing so because they cannot get the operation and medical cares they need . Pregnant women are crossing the border to give birth and mothers go to health centres in Colombia to get their babies vaccinated. Those who cannot leave often spend days and weeks searching for the medication they need. With food increasingly scarce, child malnutrition levels are at a record high. <br />Who do people blame?<br />Some of the problems go back a long time, but since the socialist government has been in power since 1999, first under President Hugo Chávez and more recently fronted by President Nicolás Maduro, many Venezuelans blame these two men for what is happening. hey say that while the socialist policies of President Chávez may have been aimed at helping the poor - Venezuela was a country of huge inequality when he came to power in 1999 - they backfired. Take price controls, for example. They were introduced by President Chávez to make basic goods more affordable to the poor by capping the price of flour, cooking oil and toiletries. But this meant that the few Venezuelan businesses producing these items soon no longer found it profitable to make them. Critics also blame the foreign currency controls brought in by President Chávez in 2003 for a flourishing black market in dollars. Since then, Venezuelans wanting to exchange bolivars for dollars have had to apply to a government-run currency agency. Only those deemed to have valid reasons to buy dollars, for example to import goods, have been allowed to change their bolivars at a fixed rate set by the government. ith many Venezuelans unable to freely buy dollars, they turned to the black market. At one point, the dollar was trading for 6.5m bolivars. But there is still a loyal core of people who support the government and who say that Venezuela's problems are caused not by President Maduro or his predecessor, but by a hostile and coup-mongering opposition inside the country, and &quot;imperialist forces&quot; like the US and neighbouring Colombia outside it. They say that US sanctions have hampered the government by making it hard to restructure its debt. Often, they have benefited directly from the government's social programmes - and argue that despite the shortages, they are still better off now than before Mr. Chávez came to power in 1999.<br />Discussions: <br />1.	Do you pay attention to the recent change of financial market in the world, such as <br />2.	The recent fluctuation of currency – depreciation and global stock market went bumpy.  According to the economy experts, the financial crisis is on the way soon. Do you pay attention to it ? <br />3.	Since Venezuela is far away from Taiwan, do you think it will create the chain reactions, like 1998 financial crisis and finally affect Taiwan’s economy?   <br />4.	If you have any investments, are you preparing to stop it? In case it happens, what would you do ?<br />5.	Do you have any ideas about the future economy in the world ? <br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00-7:30 free talk<br />(Session 1)<br />7:30-7:35 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />7:35~ 8:15 discussion session (40 mins)<br />(Session 2)<br />8:15 ~9:00pm discussion session (45 mins)<br />9:00~9:30 free talk<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
