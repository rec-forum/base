(中華電信), Taiwan's largest telecom company, could be punished for failing to address &quot;chaos&quot; in society that the firm triggered last week with its flash mob-style launch of a NT$499 (US$16.75) monthly 4G plan for unlimited data transmission.<br /><br />The telecom service provider has sparked frenzied buying since it kicked off a week-long sale of the special package Wednesday.<br /><br />The promotional move then drew Taiwan Mobile Co. (台灣大哥大) and Far EasTone Telecommunications Co. (遠傳電信), the second- and third- largest telecom firms in the country, to follow suit by introducing almost identical plans for fear of losing subscribers.<br /><br />The NT$499 flat-rate package was such a big incentive that consumers crowded all outlets of the companies across the country, forcing front-desk employees to work overtime to process a sudden surge of massive orders.<br /><br />The low rate plan, offered for a limited time from May 9-15 as a promotional strategy, triggered complaints from old clients subscribing to higher rate plans, who were only allowed to switch to the cheaper offer after they have paid fines for ending their existing contracts ahead of time.<br /><br />The consumer mania caught the attention of the National Communications Commission (NCC), an independent statutory agency responsible for regulating the development of the communications and information industry.<br /><br />On Friday, the NCC launched an investigation into accusations of inappropriate business practices, bad service and infringement of users' rights and interests against the telecoms companies, and ordered the businesses to take immediate steps to address the long lines of offer-grabbing users.<br /><br />However, &quot;no improvement has been made since then,&quot; the NCC said Sunday, ordering Chunghwa Telecom, of which the government is the largest shareholder, to explain itself at the NCC on Monday.<br /><br />Taiwan Mobile and Far EasTone will also be summoned later to make their respective statements, the regulator added.<br /><br />It noted that under the Regulations for Administration of Mobile Broadband Businesses, any operators found to have engaged in suspicious business practices or offered poor services that infringe on users' rights and interests must correct themselves within a time frame set by the NCC.<br /><br />Those failing to make improvement will be subjected to a fine ranging from NT$300,000 to NT$3 million, which can be imposed consecutively, under the Telecommunications Act, the NCC said. <br /><br />(By Liao Yu-yang and Elizabeth Hsu) <br />Enditem/sc<br /><br />Q1.

Will spending time everyday at it make a difference for you?<br />Maybe yes. Maybe no!<br />It depends on what you mean by “practice.”<br />Let’s take the example of Chloe Kim, the American snowboarder who won a gold medal in her sport.<br />I’m sure Chloe practices by going down mountains of snow hundreds of times each week. That sort of “practice” helps her.<br />But if she “practiced” for snowboarding by eating a pound of potato chips every day, that would obviously NOT help.<br />You have to do the right kind of practice.<br />What is “practice” for improving your English?<br />Many people – teachers, students, random people on the Internet – think that “practice” means actually speaking English or writing emails or talking to themselves in the mirror or repeating what other people are saying (“shadowing”).<br />In applied linguistics, we call this sort of “practice” output. Output is what, well, comes “out” of something.<br />Language comes “out” of your brain – through your mouth (speaking) or your keyboard (writing).<br />There may be some benefits (good things) about a certain amount of output, but in fact the MAIN way of improving your language skills is not through output.<br />What really helps you is the opposite of output: input.<br />Input is what goes “in” your brain.<br />Getting more input is the RIGHT kind of practice for improving your speaking – even though you are not actually speaking!<br />What exactly do I mean by “input”?<br />It’s simple: LISTENING and READING.<br />What goes in your ears (listening) or eyes (reading) is much more important than any kind of output.<br />In other words, we get better at speaking not by speaking, but by listening and reading.<br />Think of it this way: your brain has to “get” language before it can “give” language. If you don’t focus on “getting” more input, you have nothing to “output”!<br />You have to put money INTO in your bank account before you can take money OUT of your bank account.<br />Reading and listening are like money you put in your brain’s “language bank account.”<br />When we study people who become really good at second languages, we find that ALL of them have “practiced” the language thousands of hours by doing these two things: lots of listening and (especially) lots of reading.<br />So if you’re looking for a gold medal in English speaking, you really do need to “practice” it everyday – even 15 minutes a day will help you.<br />But don’t sit on the couch (sofa) eating potato chips!<br />That’s the wrong kind of practice.<br />Instead, get lots of and lots of INPUT – listen and read as much as you can.*<br />That’s the way to “winning” better English.<br />~Jeff<br /><br />Q1.What is right kind of practice for improving your English? <br />Q2. Language comes “out” of your brain – through your mouth (speaking) or your keyboard (writing).What are the benefits (good things) about a certain amount of output?<br />Q3.The input is what goes in your ears (listening) or eyes (reading); which is much more important, input or output (comparing input with output)?<br />Q4.Do you agree that we get better at speaking not by speaking, but by listening and reading?<br />Q5:What’s your way to “winning” better English?<br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />8:10 ~ 8:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:25 ~ 8:30pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:30 ~9:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~9:30pm Concluding remarks/feedback from newcomers<br /><br />The meeting place of Thursday:<br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第一區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
