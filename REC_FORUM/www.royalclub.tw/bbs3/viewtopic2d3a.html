				<div class="content">11/24(Sat.) US homeless fundraiser &amp; How to Cook Perfectly Fluffy Rice Every Time(Host: Kinny)<br /><br />US homeless fundraiser: GoFundMe campaign 'based on a lie'<br />The US protagonists in a viral fundraising campaign for a homeless man have been charged with theft by deception and conspiracy.<br />Kate McClure and Mark D'Amico raised more than $400,000 (£313,000) for homeless ex-marine Johnny Bobbitt.<br />But in August, Mr Bobbitt launched legal action against the couple, claiming he did not get his fair share.<br />Now, prosecutors in New Jersey say Mr Bobbitt was complicit in the alleged plot. All three face the same charges.<br />A lawyer for Mr D'Amico, 39 and Ms McClure, 28, declined to comment, according to US media.<br />What did the prosecutors say?<br />At Thursday's press conference, Burlington County Prosecutor Scott Coffina said the story &quot;that drove this fundraiser might seem too good to be true. Unfortunately, it was&quot;.<br />&quot;The entire campaign was predicated on a lie,&quot; he added.<br />The prosecutors believe the campaign was concocted a month before it was launched.<br />The campaign text had said that Mr Bobbitt had used &quot;his last $20&quot; to help Ms McClure when her car broke down in 2017.<br />Mr Bobbitt remains in custody, and the couple were released pending a court date on 24 December.<br />The three face potential sentences of five to 10 years for the second-degree crimes.<br />What was the original campaign?<br />Mr Bobbitt and the couple first came to prominence in November 2017 when Ms McClure launched a crowdfunding GoFundMe campaign, which, they said, was to re-pay the debt of a homeless man who came to her aid at the side of a road.<br />A photograph of Ms McClure and Mr Bobbitt, a veteran and drug addict who had lived on the streets for several years, standing on the side of the road, fronted the fundraising campaign.<br />More than 14,000 people donated, many inspired by the story's details, such as Mr Bobbitt instructing Ms McClure to lock her car doors before he returned with a can of petrol.<br />Officials said on Thursday they believe the photo was staged after the three met previously when Ms McClure and Mr D'Amico visited a casino near an underpass where Mr Bobbitt spent time.<br />When did things go wrong?<br />The relationship between the three soured in August when Mr Bobbitt brought legal action against the couple, alleging they were using the funds as their personal &quot;piggy bank&quot; to fund an extravagant lifestyle.<br />	US homeless man sues couple over $400,000 fundraiser money<br />After exceeding their original fundraising goal of $10,000, they bought clothing and a new camper van for Mr Bobbitt, but later reportedly asked him to remove it from outside their property.<br />Ms McClure and Mr D'Amico told their online supporters the money would go to two financial trusts for Mr Bobbitt, as well as a lawyer and a financial adviser to help him manage all the money.<br />&quot;Every dollar he ever touched was used for drugs,&quot; Mr D'Amico told NBC in a nationally televised interview in August.<br />	Life at an open-air drug camp in Philadelphia<br />Investigators claimed the three originally made up the story to make people feel bad and compel donors to contribute to a cause.<br />What happened to the money?<br />Net proceeds for Ms McClure and Mr D'Amico amounted to more than $367,000 (£287,000) and were spent on a car, holidays, high-end handbags and casino gambling, Mr Coffina said.<br />The prosecutor said that Mr Bobbitt received about $75,000 (£58,000).<br />In thousands of text messages read by police, the couple had discussed financial woes, inability to pay bills and debts, and Mr D'Amico said he hoped to raise more money by pursuing a book deal about the story.<br />Expressing sympathy for Mr Bobbitt's homelessness, the prosecutor nonetheless accused the veteran of being &quot;fully complicit&quot; in the campaign, promoting it in several media appearances and appearing in the original photograph.<br />Mr Bobbitt posted a similar story on Facebook in 2012 about helping a woman who had run out of petrol, officials say, but that &quot;full responsibility&quot; should be ascribed to all three.<br />In a statement to CNN, a spokesman for the crowdfunding site Go Fund Me confirmed donors who contributed to the campaign would receive a refund.<br />By Georgina Rannard, UGC &amp; Social News<br />Discussions:<br />1.	GoFundMe is a website that sharing your idea and ask people to fund you for your goal. Have you ever heard about that? Do you think it is a good idea to share your idea and ask everyone pay for that? Why or why not?<br />2.	This is a news told about a fake story funded 400,000 US dollars. Have you ever read this story before? Are you surprise of it? Would you please share your opinion of it?<br />3.	Sometimes we read some stories from internet and believe it is real. Have you doubted of that? Would you please share some fake story or news you read online <br /> <br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />How to Cook Perfectly Fluffy Rice Every Time<br />Say goodbye to sticky rice, undercooked rice, or dry, overcooked rice: This video shows how to cook rice perfectly every time.<br />From: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/cooking-tips-techniques/cooking/cook-rice">https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes ... /cook-rice</a><!-- m --> <br />What You Need<br />•	Measuring cup<br />•	Water<br />•	Saucepan with lid<br />•	Salt<br />•	Rice<br />•	Wooden spoon<br />•	Fork<br />Follow These Steps<br />1.	Boil water and add salt<br />Pour water (for every cup of rice, use 1¾ cups of water) into a large saucepan with a tight-fitting lid. Bring to a boil. Mix 1 teaspoon salt into the water.<br />2.	Pour in rice<br />Add it to the boiling water.<br />3.	Stir once, or just enough to separate the rice<br />Use a wooden spoon to separate any clumps. Don’t over-stir: That can cause the rice to become sticky.<br />4.	Cover the pot and simmer<br />Be sure the lid fits tightly on the pot. Turn down the heat to its lowest setting. Let rice simmer for about 18 minutes, then remove from heat and allow the rice to steam in the pot for another 5 minutes.<br />5.	Fluff rice with a fork<br />Just before serving, gently fluff the rice with a fork to separate the grains. And after you've cooked up your perfect rice, might we suggest some chili to go with it?<br /><br />Tip: Don’t uncover the saucepan or stir the rice during cooking. If it’s done before you’re ready to serve it, place a folded towel over the saucepan, replace the lid, and set aside. The towel will absorb excess moisture and condensation, helping prevent overcooked and mushy rice.<br />Discussions: <br />1.	Most Taiwanese use “Automatic Cooker and Steamer” for cooking rise. Have you ever cooked rice with your stove and pot/saucepan? Will you try to make it after read this article?<br />2.	Some people will soak rice around 30mins to make rice chewy. Do you have any tips for cooking rice or noodles? Try to share with us.<br />3.
