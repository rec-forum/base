Can Their Schools Be As Well?<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://international.thenewslens.com/article/157624">https://international.thenewslens.com/article/157624</a><!-- m --><br /><br />What you need to know<br />Two students weigh in on the academic culture of Taiwanese high schools.<br />The shrill calls of the alarm disperse the remaining tendrils of sleep from Stanley Hung’s mind. 6:00 a.m. The sun has barely begun to spill through the windows, barely lighting up the grey Taipei sky. He quickly packs his books, eats his breakfast, puts on his uniform, and boards the MRT. He wants to sneak an extra 20 minutes of sleep, but taking a look around the train and at his fellow students with their heads buried in their books, he decides to take out his notebooks, too. This is a typical morning for a Taiwanese high school student.<br />This strict schedule of studying will continue until 5:00 p.m., when most public schools end school hours. With nine hours of school, Taiwan has one of the longest school days in the world. With the demanding schedule and rigorous curriculum in preparation for university applications, many students report feeling stressed or deprived of their free time. For many, Taiwan’s education system focuses on rote learning, instead of critical thinking and self-directed education.<br />Janice Yeh, a recent graduate of Zhongshan Girls High School, a highly ranked public high school in Taiwan, said, “I consider the education system in Taiwan as more conservative rather than progressive, because instead of focusing on proactivity, it focuses on reactivity. The information that students acquire isn’t done so by themselves, but instead, they are spoon fed the information, which is harmful.”<br />Under this education system, some of Taiwan’s youth have decided to study abroad due to their aversion towards Taiwan’s exam-focused education. Out of the 587,554 students in the graduating class of 2019, 41,559 students, or 7% of all, have decided to do so. The number has been growing, as the number of students studying abroad has increased by roughly 23% since 2010, according to data from the Ministry of Education and the Department of Statistics under the Ministry of Economic Affairs.<br />Hung, a junior at Taipei Wego Private Senior High School, previously studied in the school’s national track, which focuses on application to Taiwanese universities. But not long into his studies, he transferred to the international track, which prepares students for universities abroad.<br />“I really dislike the test taking curriculum for the national program,” said Hung. “Everything is about grades and numbers that determine your life.”<br />These students hope to see schools lead more self-directed learning and develop their critical thinking skills. Changes have been gradually made to Taiwan’s university admission system, but some students still feel that to get into a good university, one should focus on scoring good grades in preparation for the college entrance exam.<br />“They do a terrible job at training those abilities,” said Hung. “They just give you a bunch of test papers, expect you to get a perfect grade, and nothing else.”<br />Yeh, who has gone through a program at her high school which requires students to conduct self-directed research under the guidance of a teacher, felt that such opportunities should be more widely-offered to Taiwanese high school students. Taiwan’s exam-focused teaching discourages students from exploring their interests.<br />“I feel like with these types of assignments, I can learn information other than what’s specifically taught in the course,” Yeh said. “If something interests me, I can explore it further by myself, either through the coursework or after class.”<br />However, with the decades-long influence of more traditional styles of learning, the government, schools, and students will all have to dedicate themselves to change.<br />“Currently, the public education system and the education system in general is not doing enough to foster these projects and research skills,” said Yeh. “It is partly because these courses require a lot of work on the school’s part because they have to truly prepare the students for this type of work.”<br />Taiwan’s secondary schooling system, with its heavy control over both its students’ academic coursework and their time, do not allow enough flexibility for students to do anything else. They sometimes lose sleep.<br />“I don’t think I have enough time at all,” said Yeh. “The only way I can fix that is by sacrificing my sleep.”<br />In many private schools, such as that of Hung’s, students are required to stay at school until 9:00 p.m. for self-study, totaling to about 14 hours of school a day. He said that the majority of his classmates get about five hours of sleep during school days, while Yeh said that she got around six hours, which she said was the average among her classmates.<br />But it is not entirely the schools’ fault that students don’t have much free time. Students, sometimes under their parents’ coercion, go to cram schools to catch up on the courses that they are falling behind on or to gain an advantage over their classmates.<br />“In the national track, everyone goes to cram school,” said Hung. “It is necessary in the Taiwanese education system, because [it] is focused on tests, and cram schools are designed to help you do better on tests.”<br />Another reason for the popularity of cram schools is parents’ anxiety that students will not be productive during their free time. According to both students, their parents’ concerns are somewhat justified. But they both expressed that it is still necessary for adolescents to learn how to manage their time efficiently without having a rigid schedule to follow.<br /><br />To encourage the younger generation to work hard under these conditions of stress, teachers and parents often tell students, “If you study hard during high school and get into a good university, you’ll have fun then.” Yeh said that, even when she was a junior-high student, she was constantly motivated in that way to study for the high school entrance exam.<br />This way of thinking can be potentially harmful to the quality of education for university students, and even further, the quality of Taiwan’s modern workforce. In recent years, Taiwan’s government has been trying to improve the national curriculum to value soft skills, not just the ability to score well in exams. The new 108 Curriculum includes many new elective courses, encourages self-discovery and exploration, and introduces new ways to be admitted into a high school and university.<br />Although this change is a step in the right direction towards more flexibility in Taiwan’s education system, more changes are still needed to secure the best possible future for Taiwan’s students.<br />“Many of my teachers and classmates have said that the government pushed out this program too quickly, and that there are still many improvements necessary,” Yeh said.<br />Discussion:<br />1.High school students in Taiwan are required to stay at school until 9:00 p.m. for self-study. <br />Do you / your family have this experience? How was it? Looking back on those long days, how do you / your family think of it? Do you regret at anything?<br />2.Taiwan’s exam-focused teaching discourages students from exploring their interests. <br />Do you agree to this statement? Do you know anyone who is / was bothered badly by this teaching method? Or do you know anyone who really turned over and developed differently?<br />3. The cram school plays an important role for many people in society. Share with your experiences / stories about cram school.  <br />4. If your budget is loose, would you let your teenage children study abroad alone? What would you/your children care about most?<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Session 2:<br />Restaurants dangle discounts to tempt blood donors (2021/11/04)<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://englishnews.ftv.com.tw/read.aspx?sno=D462C6215923E06EA418194EB5898033">https://englishnews.ftv.com.tw/read.asp ... 4EB5898033</a><!-- m --><br />A new promotion in Wanhua will reward blood donors with restaurant discounts throughout November. Three restaurants are involved in the project, giving away chef-made meals to blood donors, in an effort to replenish depleted blood banks. To claim your reward, you just have to produce your callback card, which proves you are a blood donor.<br /><br />A rich meat sauce is topped with a soft poached egg. With a side salad and an iced tea, this set meal is almost NT$200, but if you present your blood donor card, you can get NT$100 off.<br /><br />This fresh tiramisu is made in the traditional way, with lady’s fingers soaked in espresso, lathered in mascarpone cream and dusted with a delicate halo of cocoa powder. Normally up to NT$100, it’s on the house for blood donors.<br /><br />Mr. Yang<br />Restaurant owner<br />We calculated the costs of the ingredients, and I think it’s great to do something for the wider good, and the blood banks need blood right now, so let’s encourage people to donate more.<br /><br />Member of public<br />It’s driving customers into the restaurant, and I think it’s great. You get NT$100 off, it’s a lot. I think it will attract quite a lot of people.<br /><br />Previous promotions for blood donors included milk and toilet paper. Now, with a wave of your callback card, you can get a full meal. The driving force behind the project is a real estate firm.<br /> in Taipei’s Wanhua District. This estate broker was moved to start a Wanhua community project after the district was hit by COVID in May. Blood donors can head to any participating restaurant throughout November, no matter where they donated blood. Each restaurant has 50 discounted meals to give away.<br /><br />Ms. Fu Real estate agent <br />We’ve all felt the impact of the pandemic, whether in real estate or in any industry. And Wanhua was really deeply injured. So we thought we would use a very down-to-earth thing which is easy for everyone to do, which is giving blood.<br /><br />Three restaurants are involved in the project. One is offering a NT$100 discount voucher, while the other two are offering special meal promotions, including salt chicken with vegetables, cold or fried noodles, and side dishes. Chefs hope that after the public gives what they can to the blood bank, they’ll take time to sit down, enjoy a good meal, and regain their strength.<br /><br />Discussion:<br />1.How many times have you donated blood? If no, what was the reason?<br />How were your mood / feel when you donated for the first time?<br /><br />2. What motivated you to stretch out your arm to give blood?<br />Are you planning to donate blood if it is convient?<br /><br />3. Three restaurants provide blood donors with special meal promotions or low-cost full meals. What do you think of the policy? Is it productive?<br />Do you know anyone who donated blood under this kind of reward?<br /><br />4. According to the websites of Ministry of Health and Welfare, Mr. Lee has donated hid blood up to 322 times in 29 years. Can you imagine any possibilities for him to do this? What would you say to Mr.Lee?<br /><br /><br />P.S.<br />1.參加三次後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />2.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12531">Danny Lin</a> — Mon Dec 13, 2021 9:27 am</p><hr />
