			<div class="content">How to make stress your friend<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/48298?ref=speech">https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/48298?ref=speech</a><!-- m --><br />I have a confession to make. For years I have been telling people &quot;Stress makes you sick.&quot; But I have changed my mind about stress. I wanna change yours. Let me start with the study that tracked 30,000 adults in the United States for 8 years. And they started by asking people &quot;How much stress have you experienced in the last year?&quot; They also asked &quot;Do you believe that stress is harmful for your health?&quot;. People who experienced a lot of stress in the previous year had a 43% increased risk of dying, but that was only true for the people who also believed that stress is harmful for your health. People who experienced a lot of stress, but did not view stress as harmful, they had the lowest risk of dying as anyone in the study. 182,000 Americans died prematurely from the belief that stress is bad for you. <br /><br />I want you all to pretend you are participants in a study- you come into the laboratory, you have to give a 5 minute impromptu speech on your personal weaknesses to a panel of expert evaluators sitting right in front of you, now if you were actually in this study, you probably be a little stressed out - your heart might be pounding, you might be breathing faster, now normally we interpret these physical changes as anxiety, but what if you viewed them instead, as signs that your body was preparing you to meet this challenge? Now that is exactly what participants were told in a study conducted at Harvard University. And participants who learned to view the stress response as helpful, while they were less stressed out, less anxious, more confident, their physical stress response changed.<br /><br /> Now, in a typical stress response, your heart rate goes up, and your blood vessels constrict, but in the study when participants viewed their stress response as helpful, their blood vessels stayed relaxed, like this. Their heart was still pounding but this is a much healthier cardiovascular profile- it's a lot like what happens in moments of courage. We need to talk about a hormone - oxytocin. Oxytocin makes you crave physical contact with your friends and family, it enhances your empathy. Your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out as part of the stress response, and one of its main roles in your body is to protect your cardiovascular system from the effects of stress. Your heart has receptors for this hormone, and oxytocin helps heart cells regenerate from any stress-induced damage. I wanna finish by telling you about one more study. This study tracked about a 1000 adults in the United States and they started the study by asking &quot;How much stress have you experienced in the last year? &quot; They also asked &quot;How much time have you spent helping out friends?&quot; People who spent time caring for others, showed absolutely no stress related increase in dying, zero. When you choose to view your stress response as helpful, you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect with others under stress, you can create resilience.<br /><br />Question<br />1.	Do you agree the more stress the more potential grow up? <br />2.	Do you have some tips to train how to improve the stress resistance? <br />3.	Where are your stresses from? <br />4.	Have you ever courage your friends when they got a lot of stresses and failure? How to do?<br /><br /><br />Can You Be Sued For Saving Someone’s Life?<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/35012">https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/35012</a><!-- m --><br /><br />In June 2015, New York’s state Senate passed a new Good Samaritan law. The law protects those who would break the window of a hot car to save a child. Good Samaritan laws around the world offer different protections in different situations. So, what exactly are Good Samaritan laws? Well essentially, the law gives legal protection from being prosecuted, to those who attempt to help people that are injured, or in danger. The idea is that in some cases, people may think twice about assisting others if potentially threatened with a lawsuit. These laws are found around the world. However, some countries have caveats concerning the situations in which they apply. In many countries Good Samaritan laws simply protect the intervening party, as well as any medical professionals. However, not all parts of those countries have similar laws. For example, certain regions of Canada, such as New Brunswick don’t have Good Samaritan laws. But in Quebec, bystanders are legally required to step in and help. This is called a “duty to rescue”. This concept means that if you’re near somebody who needs help, you are required to step in, or call the police. <br /><br />Duty to rescue is found in Germany, Israel, and parts of the United States. In fact, Israel even offers compensation to rescuers, and pays for any damages incurred. While in Germany, refusing to assist can be punishable by law. In the US, all but 8 states have Good Samaritan laws for individuals, and two have a duty to rescue. Additionally, some states apply the concept of “imminent peril”. This means that one is not protected under these laws if the person they are trying to help is not immediately facing significant danger, injury, or death. A common example is somebody who suffers a car accident and is forcibly removed from the vehicle by a “Good Samaritan”. If there is nothing demanding immediate attention, like the car being on fire, then the Good Samaritan is not protected by Good Samaritan laws. This is to avoid situations where injured people are inadvertently injured further. On the flipside, countries with no protections have disastrous cultural results. China is well known for situations where Good Samaritans are sued by the people they help. This has led to a phenomenon of bystanders outright refusing to assist those in immediate peril. One particularly gruesome case was in 2011, when a toddler was struck by two vehicles.<br /><br /> A video shows 18 bystanders walk past the injured child lying motionless, but they do nothing to help her. In a survey taken later that year, more than 70% of those polled believed that the bystanders were afraid of getting in trouble for trying to help the little girl. As a global society intended to help each other in times of need, Good Samaritan laws prevent a chilling effect on this normal human behavior. The idea that one should fear retribution for offering assistance, and potentially saving a life, has no place in modern society.<br /><br />Question<br />1.	Do you agree we should make a law to protect people who save someone’s life? Or do you agree we should make a law called”duty to rescue”?<br />2.	Have you ever had experiences to help strangers who need to help or be helper?<br />3.	Why are people afraid to help strangers?</div>
