9/14(Sat.)Equal pay, equal work  &amp; online dating (Host:Shuman)<br /><br />Equal pay, equal work <br />Across the world, women still get paid 23 per cent less than men. Chidi King, Director of the Equality Department of the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), the main international trade union organization representing the interests of working people worldwide, and a member of UN Women and ILO’s Equal Pay Champions initiative, unpacks the issue.<br />Globally, the gender pay gap stands at 23 per cent globally. What’s behind this gap?<br />The global gender pay gap is an expression of persistent inequalities between men and women in our societies and in our places of work. The social and cultural norms that broadly cast men’s roles as decision-makers and women’s roles as carers, play a significant part—not only in terms of the type of paid work into which women are channelled—but in terms of how that work is valued and remunerated.<br />When women enter the formal labour market, their paid work and their role as workers is often seen as subsidiary or supplementary to their principle role of “homemakers”. This in turn impacts how women are paid. Even where women have equivalent or better qualifications than men, their skills are not valued the same as men's and their career progression is slower.<br />But the main underlying reason for the gender pay gap is that women tend to be concentrated in different jobs to those of men; and jobs tend to be valued along gender lines. In order to ensure “equal pay for work of equal value”, we need to address the fact that a job in the male-dominated construction sector, for example, may be of the same or similar objective value as a job in female dominated child-care sector (in terms of skill, effort, responsibility and working conditions). Yet, the job in the female-dominated child care sector will almost invariably be less well paid. The way we value different types of jobs has to change—and this has been recognized by the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention 100, dating back to 1951. <br />Question<br />1.Is it illegal to pay different wages for the same job? <br />2.Does equal pay apply to same gender? <br />3.Why do we still see pay discrepancies?<br />4.Do you have any tips to Fighting the system?<br /><br /><br />The Advantages and Disadvantages of Online Dating<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://startingoverworkshops.com/2017/07/23/online-dating-2/">https://startingoverworkshops.com/2017/ ... -dating-2/</a><!-- m --> <br />I hope you learned some new stuff in the last blog about Online Dating. If you’re not a single adult why not forward this blog to someone you care about who could benefit from these blogs?  Despite all the differing opinions there are advantages and disadvantages to online dating.<br />As a former single adult pastor I’ve seen the up and the downside of online dating of hundreds.  Today, 2 out of 5 relationships begin online and people who once were reluctant to admit they used online dating are rarer.<br />While researching this vast complicated and emotionally charged subject over the years, especially for Christians, I have discovered perhaps along with you, that there is lot of conflicting information about online dating. In the process of writing this blog I came across  article entitled “How Do I Love Thee?” in the Atlantic Monthly that is worth reading.<br />Although a very pragmatic article, it has a lot of good factual data that offers fairly objective critiques of the scientific matchmaking of eHarmony, Match.com and Chemistry.com. The article raises important questions about the data these scientists are collecting on relationships and personality types.<br />These web sites all have full time staff PhDs in the social sciences, anthropology, and psychology that are constantly polling and testing thousands of willing participants that will help people find their best possible match.<br />Of course this research and development helps these sites become successful, but is all this test tube data reliable and does it take out the mystique of romance and remove the human factor of face-to-face connection?  Remember while the data can be very helpful, it will never be infallible.  According to some there are advantages and disadvantages to online dating.<br />Advantages:<br />    • Meeting people existing outside social networks where they would otherwise never meet<br />    • Meeting more people quicker with similar core values, faith, interests, background and preferences<br />    • Offers privacy and confidentiality (turns out now this is not necessarily true)<br />    • More convenient than other ways of trying to meet people<br />    • Safer than many other conventional dating methods<br />The advantage to ‘scientific’ online dating isn’t to come up with some foolproof formula for romantic connection, but it can offer a safeguard to prevent you from making a poor choice.<br />Disadvantages:<br />    • People lie about themselves. 61% of users report concerns about members misrepresenting themselves<br />According to Lori Gottlieb, the author of the article How Do I Love Thee? says, “Women tend to lie in their profiles about their weight and their age. And men tend to lie about their height and how much hair they have. That just seems to be a given. But there are other things that people may lie about as well—and I use the word “lie” loosely. They may answer questions in a way that’s sort of fudging the truth a little bit…”<br />    • Users hide information about themselves and one cannot know for certain someone’s true character. They may not tell things about them you need to know.<br />    • Geographical distance makes physical closeness difficult, if not impossible.<br />    • Increased potential for identity theft.<br />    • The speed of the online relationship cannot ensure you’re seeing a person for who they really are and all you need to know about someone’s past experiences.<br />    • Wasted resources.  A third of all online dating users have never met anyone face to face as a result of their time, efforts and money.<br />Please know these recent blogs are not endorsements of any kind.
