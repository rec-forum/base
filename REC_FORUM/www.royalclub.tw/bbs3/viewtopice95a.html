The scientists say smokers are two times more likely to lose their vision than non-smokers. <br /><br />Everyone knows that smoking can damage the lungs and heart, but not many people know it could damage the eyesight. The scientists are from the Association of Optometrists (AOP) in the United<br />Kingdom. <br /><br />The AOP has started a campaign to raise awareness of the danger of smoking to the eyes. The campaign is called &quot;Stub it out&quot;. The word &quot;stub&quot; means put out a cigarette by pushing the end against something hard; &quot;stub it out&quot; is saying, &quot;stop smoking&quot;. The AOP said only one in five people thinks  smoking can damage the eyes.<br /><br />The AOP explained why smoking is so harmful to the eyes. Cigarette smoke gets in the eyes and causes or worsens a number of different eye problems. Cigarette smoke contains toxic chemicals that can irritate and damage the eyes. Smoke contains tiny pieces of metals like lead and copper.<br />These can get into the eyes and lead to cataracts - a condition that causes the eye lens to become cloudy. People with cataracts usually need an operation to restore their sight.<br /><br />Smoke can also increase the chance of worsening sight problems for people with diabetes. The AOP said smokers are also three times more likely to damage the eyes' muscles. The AOP has encouraged smokers to quit.<br /><br />Dicussion<br /><br />1. Why do you think people smoke?<br />2. What other dangers of smoking are there?<br />3. What can people do to look after their eyesight?<br />4. Should smoking be banned all around the world?<br />5. Should non-smokers be able to sue smokers for eye damage?<br />6. Why is it difficult for people to quit smoking?<br />7. What advice do you have for smokers?<br /><br />Article 2:Full Stop Seen as Rude in Text Messages<br /><br />Is it RUDE to use full stops in text messages? Linguist reveals why the punctuation mark is making you look 'passive aggressive'<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-7309543/Internet-linguist-reveals-using-stops-text-messages-make-look-passive-aggressive.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/arti ... ssive.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />A language expert says using a full stop to end sentences in text messages can look rude. A full stop is used in British English; in American English, this punctuation mark is called a period.<br /><br />Linguist Gretchen McCulloch says more and more people think ending messages with a full stop is rude. She said this view is most common in younger people who use instant messaging apps like Twitter and Facebook Messenger. Ms McCulloch said people prefer to send a completely new message instead of ending a sentence with a full stop. She said: &quot;If you're a young person and you're sending a message to someone, the default way to break up your thoughts is to send each thought as a new message.&quot;<br /><br />The full stop dates back around 2,300 years. It is an essential part of writing today. School teachers can put lots of comments in red ink on a student's writing if that student forgets to add the full stop at the end of his or her sentence.<br /><br />However, technology is changing the way we write. Most people now use abbreviations or acronyms in text messages. They might use the acronym 'LOL' instead of writing 'laugh out loud,' or the abbreviation 'fyi' rather than typing 'for your information'.<br /><br />Ms McCulloch says not using the full stop helps the writer save time. She also says that a full stop can make the writer look a little aggressive. Many people prefer to end a sentence with an emoji or emoticon instead of a full stop <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Discussion<br />1. Are you good at using punctuation?<br />2. Is not using a full stop rude?<br />3. Are older people better at writing?<br />4. Is it important to use punctuation in text messages?<br />5. Is an emoticon better than a full stop?<br />6. What do you think about emojis and emoticons?<br />7. Do we really need capital letters?<br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00 ~ 7:30 pm greetings &amp; free talk <br />7:30 ~ 8:15 pm guests introduced &amp; first session discussion <br />8:15 ~ 8:45 pm presentation, sharing the article &amp; other experiences <br />8:45 ~ 9:30 pm second session discussion<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />a minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
