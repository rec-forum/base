Below is all you need to know about the COVID-19 stimulus plan. <br /><br />How to Apply<br />Taiwanese citizens, spouses of Taiwanese nationals who hold a permanent resident certificate (居留證), and those in the process of applying for Taiwanese citizenship are eligible for the stimulus vouchers. <br />The stimulus program laid out by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) allows you to buy NT$3000 worth of shopping vouchers for NT$1000. The vouchers are available for pre-order starting July 1st. <br /><br />Pre-Ordering<br />Visit the “Triple Stimulus Voucher” official website (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://3000.gov.tw/">https://3000.gov.tw</a><!-- m -->) and register for the vouchers. The vouchers can also be pre-ordered in Taiwan’s four major convenience store chains and post offices. <br />For the online website and convenience stores, there will be two registration windows: From July 1 to July 7 and from Aug. 1 to Aug. 7. You can pay for your vouchers and select the pick-up location during the aforesaid dates. <br />If you want to pick up your vouchers at a post office between July 15 and Dec. 31, you will need to do it in-person. Post offices will open for two additional Saturdays to accommodate the process on July 18 and July 25.<br />Please bring your National Health Insurance (NHI), government-issued Identification Card or Alien Residence Certificate (ARC) for identification when purchasing/picking up the coupons. <br />If you wish to use credit cards, contactless smartcards, and mobile payment apps, you can register at relevant websites starting on July 1 too. <br /><br />How to Use Them<br />According to National Development Council (國家發展委員會) Minister Kung Ming-hsin (龔明鑫), the vouchers can be used to shop at selected stores, buy train tickets and pay for taxi fares in Taiwan. <br />According to MOEA’s website, those using credit cards will receive a NT$2,000 deduction of next month’s bill after spending NT$3,000. For contactless smartcards and mobile payment apps, they will receive NT$2,000 worth of credit in their account. <br /><br />Limits<br />The stimulus coupons cannot be used to pay for financial products, water and electricity bills, pre-existing fines, the National Health Insurance fee, administrative fees, electronic tickets, fitness center points, food coupons, video game points and InComm gift cards. <br />However, these coupons can be used for art exhibitions, sporting events, travel activities, and e-commerce platforms approved by the authorities. The government plans to provide recognizable identification for websites that allow vouchers use. <br />Although these coupons can be used to deduct hospital registration fees, telephone bills, gas, natural gas and cable TV service fees, it is more cost-effective to utilize consumption discounts on these fees rather than to use these coupons aimed to stimulate the economy. <br /><br />Other information<br />For socially-vulnerable groups, the government will directly transfer NTD$1000 under “stimulus vouchers” to pay for them. It will be available free to 1.2 million mid-to-low income households.<br />For more information about the stimulus vouchers, please visit (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://3000.gov.tw/">https://3000.gov.tw</a><!-- m -->)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Government receives over 4.7 million pre-orders for stimulus vouchers</span><br />07/04/2020 10:08 PM</span><br /><br />Taipei, July 4 (CNA) More than 4.7 million people in Taiwan have applied for the government-issued stimulus vouchers, since pre-ordering opened Wednesday, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Saturday.<br />As of 4 p.m. Saturday, some 4.77 million people had placed pre-orders for the NT$3,000 vouchers, either online or at convenience stores, MOEA data showed.<br />Of that number, 3.66 million people had chosen the printed version of the vouchers, while the others had opted for digital versions, according to the ministry.<br />Among those choosing the digital options, 761,738 people had linked the vouchers to their credit cards, 238,260 to stored value cards, and 107,838 to some form of mobile payment, the ministry's data showed.<br />Under the NT$50 billion (US$1.69 billion) stimulus program, Taiwan citizens and foreign spouses of citizens can pay NT$1,000 to obtain the NT$3,000 vouchers, which can be used to purchase a wide range of goods and services.<br />The initial pre-ordering period will run through July 7, and the vouchers can be used with effect from July 15, as part of the government's plan to spur domestic consumption amid the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.<br />Orders can be placed at convenience stores around Taiwan or on the website of the Small and Medium Enterprise Administration (SMEA) of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://3000.gov.tw/">https://3000.gov.tw/</a><!-- m -->.<br />A second round of pre-ordering will be held Aug. 1-7.<br /><br />Questions:<br />1. Do you pre-order the vouchers yet? What method do you use to apply? Order vouchers, credit card, smartcard or mobile payment app?    <br />2. Why do the majority of people prefer choosing the printed version of the vouchers to digital versions?<br />3. Do you think the qualification of people for vouchers and the limits to use the vouchers are reasonable?<br />4. Do you think buying NT$3000 worth of shopping vouchers for NT$1000 is good policy? Will it really stimulate economy?<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Session 2: New restrictions on U.S. visas to impact Taiwan students</span></span><br /><br />P.S. As of July, 14. Trump's government has dropped its plans to deport international students whose courses move fully online because of the coronavirus pandemic.<br /><br />TAIPEI (The China Post) — The U.S. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced on Monday a new regulation that requires foreign students to leave the U.S. should their classes be held online, forcing many Taiwanese students to return home to continue their education. <br /><br />If schools only conduct online courses, U.S. officials stated that immigration offices won’t issue visas to international students who are still abroad either.<br />According to a press release issued by the ICE, international students with non-immigrant M-1 or F-1 visas whose courses will be held entirely online cannot stay or enter the United States legally.<br />These students are recommended to transfer to schools that accept physical teaching in order to maintain their legal status. <br /><br />If schools provide a combination of face-to-face and online learning, however, students can take some online courses and stay in the U.S. as long as the school can prove that not all of their students are taking online courses.<br />Students would also need to notify the institution within ten days should they decide to change courses midway through the semester, the ICE added. <br /><br />Meanwhile, universities have been trying to find ways to safely reopen in the fall. In many major universities, students have been forced to leave campus and take classes remotely throughout the semester. <br />According to Statista, a german portal for statistics, 23,369 Taiwanese students attended school abroad in the United States for the school year of 2018-2019.<br /><br />For the most recent school year of 2019-2020, specific statistics have not been published on how many Taiwanese students are attending school in the United States because of the coronavirus forcing many students to return back to their families in Taiwan.<br />However, with the upward trend of students attending school in the States in the previous years, it’s clear that the effect of the regulations will have a rebounding effect on numerous Taiwanese students. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">University of California plans to sue federal government over new international student guidelines</span></span><br /><br />BERKELEY, Calif. - The University of California said Wednesday it plans to sue the federal government over new guidelines that bar international students from staying in the U.S. if they attend universities that only offer online courses this fall.<br />According to UC, the lawsuit will seek a temporary restraining over and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to bar Immigration and Customs Enforcement from enforcing the new order. On Monday, the Department of Homeland Security and ICE said international students will be forced to return to their home countries or transfer to another school if their school only offers online classes in the fall.<br />  <br />The policy has left many universities, including UC Berkeley, to find a balance for in-person and remote classes. UC Berkeley Associate Professor of Statistics, Fernando Perez, said the policy is problematic.<br />“My own students who are absolutely terrified because their lives are being upended,” Perez said. This is a policy that undermines one of the greatest assets the U.S. has, which is that we basically that we get to play with the all star team of the world. We have the best higher education system in the world and it is attractive to the best students from every country.”<br /><br />According to the guidance, new visas will not be given to students only taking classes online. That has prompted many professors from universities across the country to offering in-person independent study sessions. The professors have reached out to students on Twitter from universities including USC, University of Arizona, Northwestern, and Penn State.<br />Terry Hartle, with the American Council on Education, said the guidelines will result in confusion as schools look to reopen safely. American Council on Education represents university presidents.<br /><br />“There’s a great deal of unhappiness and concern about this, because we think it is a poorly designed policy, being implemented arbitrarily, and in a way that is going to dramatically complicate efforts of colleges and universities to reopen for all students,” Hartle said.<br />He went on to say that the Department of Homeland Security has imposed a deadline for schools to make a decision on reopening by July 15, but not all schools will be ready to make a decision by that time.<br /><br />“This policy is completely indifferent to the pandemic,” Hartle said. “It's completely indifferent to the impact that it will have on students who are already in the country. And in some senses it's cruel because it expects students to leave the country if their school isn't online and when they might not be able to do that. Some countries aren't accepting people from the U.S.&quot;<br />A PhD student who attends UC Berkeley spoke to KTVU on the condition that she remain anonymous. She said she is concerned because she returned to Europe after the COVID-19 outbreak to be with her grandparents. She needs to return to Berkeley to attend some classes in person in order to maintain her visa status, but she is unable to return due to the current travel ban.<br /><br />“This is putting us between a rock and a hard place because the reason we are trying to do things online is for reasons of public health and public safety,” Perez said.<br />Chancellor Carol Christ and Vice Provost for Academic Planning and Senior International Officer Lisa Alvarez-Cohen sent a message to the campus community on Tuesday. It reads in part: “We recognize the concern and anxiety these new rules have created, and we are moving quickly to ensure that we offer the proper balance of online and in-person classes so that our students can remain in the U.S. and satisfy their visa requirements, and that those students residing outside the U.S. can maintain their enrollment status.”<br /><br />Harvard and MIT announced Wednesday they had filed a similar lawsuit against the Trump administration over the new guidelines.<br /><br />P.S. As of July, 14. Trump's government has dropped its plans to deport international students whose courses move fully online because of the coronavirus pandemic.<br /><br />Questions:<br />1. What benefits will US government get from the new guidelines on change of student visas?<br />2. How will it influence US Universities? Will it decrease the number of foreign students in US?<br />3. Will U. of Ca. Berkeley win the lawsuit against US government?<br />4. Will Taiwanese student change their destinations of studying abroad, e.g. UK, Canada, or Australia etc.?<br />5. Is this an education trend of studying in on-line classes?<br />6. Trump is a fickle president, will he succeed in winning 2nd term of presidency?</div>
