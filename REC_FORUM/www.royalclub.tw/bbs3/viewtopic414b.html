Do you agree that some people are usually luckier than others? What makes you think those people have better fortune? How do you view the unfairness? <br /><br />2.	Do you think that you are a lucky person? What makes you think that way?<br /><br />3.	Among 4 principles to make your own luck as indicated in the video, which ones have you already practiced in daily life? Which ones haven’t you tried but would like to have a try?<br />Hint: (1) find more opportunities (2) listen to your gut feeling (3) expect to be lucky (4) always find the positives.<br /><br />4.

Do you make decisions based on experience, sober analysis or intuitive thinking? Does anyone outweigh others?<br /><br />2.	Do you believe in love at first sight? Do you think that love at first sight is often cured by a second look? According to a research, almost 90 percent of those deemed lucky said that they trusted their intuition when it came to their relationships. Have you ever chosen your partner based on your gut feeling? What happened?<br /><br /><br />3.	Do you think that intuitive thinking is faster than a rational approach but more prone to error? The article mentioned that “The problem with fast thinking is the existence of dozens of different cognitive biases which can lead us towards the wrong answer: we tend to be over-optimistic; we prefer simple solutions; we notice and remember information that confirms what we already think; and we favor continuing down paths in we’ve already invested time or money in.” How much do you agree with those opinions? Have you ever made right choices in career, investments or life challenges, etc. based on your own gut feelings?<br /><br />4.	The researchers suggested that “when our intuition sends us in one direction it’s worth assessing the situation more coldly. Could any of these cognitive biases be sending us astray? What are the arguments for the other option? Do we have real expertise in this area? Are we rushing into a decision just to get it over with? Could we wait to see what happens next? “ Do you think those check lists make sense?<br /><br /><br /><span style="color: #BF0000">P.S.<br />1.因聚會地點是在咖啡店內，所以有低消80元喔！<br />2.參加三次後，只要繳交1000元 (學生:500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />3.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~</span></div>
