			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Host : Ian</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Article 1 - How to Choose a Travel Partner</span><br /><a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Choose-a-Travel-Partner" class="postlink">http://www.wikihow.com/Choose-a-Travel-Partner</a><br /><br />Traveling solo gives you the freedom to create your own schedule and do as you please. But traveling with a partner has its benefits, too. For example, a travel partner can provide moral support and celebrate in the rewards of firsthand experience with unfamiliar locations and cultures. To ensure that a travel partner is one who can add value to your journey, choose someone who has similar travel preferences and personality characteristics. There are several steps you can take to find a travel partner who will enhance your journey.<br /><br />Method 1 - Picking a Compatible Travel Partner<br /><br />1<br />Look for someone with common interests. Traveling should be fun. When you are on a trip, you will want to do lots of activities that you are enjoy. Preferably, your companion will want to do the same things as you.[1]<br />Think about your travel priorities. Make a list of all of your &quot;must dos&quot;.<br />For example, maybe you are planning a trip to France. If visiting The Louvre is a priority, make sure your travel partner wants to go, too.<br />Remember that you don't have to do all of the activities together. But when you travel with someone, it is fun to do at least some things with each other.<br /><br />2<br />Consider energy levels. When you travel, there are many types of experiences that you could have. You could be very active or you might be looking for a more sedate trip. Find a travel partner who has an agenda and energy level similar to yours.[2]<br />Think about what type of trip you want to have. Are you looking forward to walking a lot? Do you plan to be doing a lot of physical activities, such as scuba diving?<br />If you anticipate being active, try to look for a friend who enjoys being active. Maybe your pal from the gym would be a good choice.<br />Likewise, if you plan to chill, take that into account. If you want to spend your days relaxing on the beach, you don't want a travel partner who will be constantly nagging you to get moving.<br /><br />3<br />Discuss financial plans. Before you travel, you should plan a budget. Figure out what items are most important to you. For example, do you want to splurge on luxury lodging and save by not doing many excursions? Get a good idea of what things will cost.[3]<br />Before traveling with a friend, make sure that you are on the same page concerning money. You don't want to be planning an expensive getaway at the same time your friend is looking for budget travel.<br />Try asking specific questions. You can say, &quot;How much do you think we should spend on a hotel each night?&quot;<br />You can also plan a budget together. Say, &quot;Let's sit down and work out how much we want to spend per day.&quot;<br /><br />4<br />Have an honest conversation. If you are thinking about traveling with a companion, take some time to have an open discussion. You should discuss your goals for the trip. You could also talk about your travel style.[4]<br />Schedule a time to sit down and talk. Try saying, &quot;I know we've talked hypothetically about traveling through Europe together. Let's have coffee this week and actually talk that through.&quot;<br />Be upfront. If there is something about you that your friend needs to know, go a head and share that.<br />For example, you might need to say, &quot;I'm a nervous flyer. Is there anything I should know about traveling with you?&quot;<br /><br />5<br />Find someone who is flexible. No matter how carefully you plan your trip, it is likely that something will go awry. Maybe it will rain on the day you planned to visit the Grand Canyon. Or you might not be able to get reservations at that French restaurant you've been dying to try.[5]<br />Choose a travel partner who can adjust. You don't want to be stuck with someone who declares the whole trip ruined if you have to adjust plans.<br />Travel with a friend who is pretty easygoing. Do you have a buddy who is willing to go out for sushi, even if you'd planned on having pizza? That person might be easy to get along with.<br />Make sure that you're flexible, too. Remember that you're on vacation to relax and have fun. Try to just go with the flow if you have to change your agenda.<br /><br />Method 2 - Meeting a New Travel Partner<br /><br />1<br />Talk to a friend of a friend. Maybe you're planning a big trip and looking for someone to go with you. It can be frustrating if none of your close friends or family can go with you. Try expanding your network.<br />Ask your friends if they know anyone who wants to travel with you. For example, maybe your friend has a cousin who has always wanted to take an Alaskan cruise, just like the one you are planning.<br />Use social media to make connections. Make a post looking for a travel partner, tagging multiple friends. That way, their friends will see your post, too.<br />Make sure to try to meet your new travel partner in person before your trip. If that's not possible, correspond by e-mail or phone and get to know one another.<br /><br />Stay at a hostel. Sometimes you just can't find someone you know to travel with you. That's okay. Traveling alone can be really fun. And there are lots of ways to meet new travel companions along the way.[6]<br />A hostel is a great place to meet new friends. These inexpensive lodgings are very common in Europe.<br />Staying at a hostel is often a communal experience. Make some reservations to stay at various hostels, and get ready to meet your fellow travelers.<br />Connect with a new group of people. If you meet some people that you get along with, ask if you can go along with them to the next city.<br /><br />3<br />Find a gap year program. If you are young, consider taking a gap year. A gap year is a year between high school and college. People often spend their gap year traveling.[7]<br />Gap year travel is very common among Europeans. It is becoming increasingly popular in the United States.<br />Search the internet for a study abroad program. Based on your interests, you will be placed with a group of like-minded travelers.<br />Try using a reputable website such as Go Overseas. They have options for short and long trips, with a variety of locations and objectives.<br /><br />4<br />Join a travel group. Don't worry if you can't find someone you know to travel with you. There are businesses that are professionals at setting you up with the travel experience of your dreams. You can use these organizations to find wonderful travel partners.[8]<br />Web sites such as Globe Trooper offer many traveler designed trips. You can use their site to meet other people who want to visit great ski resorts in Europe.<br />These sites offer a variety of trips. Make sure to look for ones planned by people who share your interests.<br />When you are traveling with a group of new people, the same rules apply as when you travel with a friend. Make sure you have the same interests, energy level, and financial plans.<br /><br />Method 3 - Making the Most of Your Trip<br /><br />1<br />Do your research. Traveling should be relaxing and enjoyable. If you want, it should also be full of adventures. Just make sure that your adventures come from things like climbing mountains, not staying in dubious lodgings. [9]<br />Before you travel, take some time to do your research. Start by reading reviews.<br />Read traveler reviews of every place you plan to stay. You want to know if other people experienced big problems like the heat not working or the doors not locking.<br />Use a site like Trip Advisor. They post multiple reviews for every aspect of traveling.[10]<br /><br />2<br />Manage your expectations. You want your vacation to be amazing. That's natural. But make sure to keep your expectations realistic.[11]<br />Try not to get upset if something goes wrong. For example, don't consider the whole trip ruined if one of your adventures gets rained out.<br />Plan to have a good time. But be ready to laugh it off if something unexpectedly goes awry.<br />Maybe you're traveling in New York, and the restaurant lost your reservation. That's disappointing, but it's also a great excuse to try a slice of famous NYC pizza.<br /><br />3<br />Disconnect from technology. Take a true time out when you are on vacation. Try not to be tethered to your phone or laptop. Avoid the urge to check your e-mail multiple times a day.[12]<br />Don't check social media multiple times a day. Try to enjoy your own experiences.<br />Focus on being in the moment. Look around at your surroundings, and find somewhere new to explore.<br />Relax and enjoy. Make an effort to forget about work and responsibilities. You're on vacation![13]<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion</span><br />1. Are you enjoying travel along or with others, why or why not? <br />2. What are the essence of a good travel partner would be like? <br />3. If you have a fight with your partner during the trip, what would you do to solve this problem?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Article 2 - 7 Ways to Get Along Better With Your Coworkers</span><br /><a href="https://www.thebalance.com/get-along-better-with-coworkers-525457" class="postlink">https://www.thebalance.com/get-along-better-with-coworkers-525457</a><br /><br />There is an excellent chance you spend more time with your coworkers than with anyone else. That includes your spouse, kids, parents or friends. If you have a good relationship with them, that may not be a bad thing, but if you don't, your time at work can be miserable. If you don't know how to get along with your coworkers, it's time you found out.<br /><br />Good workplace relationships can help you do your job better. They can make going to work every day enjoyable or, at least, tolerable. Bad ones can distract you from your duties and can turn a so-so job into a nightmare. Follow these tips to learn how to get along better with your coworkers.<br /><br />1  Respect Your Colleagues<br /><br />For any relationship to succeed, the individuals who are part of it must have—and show—respect for each other. One way to demonstrate respect is by avoiding doing things others might find offensive. For example, don't leave a mess behind, don't come to work sick and don't steal credit for someone else's work. More <br /><br />2  Steer Clear of Cringe-Worthy Topics<br /><br />You might feel so comfortable with your colleagues that you think it's ok to talk about anything at work. What you must keep in mind is that your coworkers are a captive audience. They can't leave if they don't like the topic of conversation, and they may feel awkward asking you to change it. Some controversial subject matters, politics and religion for example, could even cause arguments that might lead to discord in the workplace. Wait until you're with your friends and family to discuss them. More <br /><br /><br />3  Get Your Workplace Relationships Off to a Good Start<br /><br />There are a lot of things to stress over when you start a new job, but you may be most worried about forming relationships with your new coworkers. If you didn't get along with your colleagues at your last job, you might fret that things will be the same at this one. If you had great relationships, you could be concerned things will never be the same.<br /><br />It may not happen overnight, but you will eventually bond with everyone (or at least almost everyone) at your new job. You can get off to a good start by being friendly to your new coworkers. A warm smile goes a long way. Asking questions and accepting lunch invitations do too. More <br /><br />4  Find A Way to Get Along With Even the Most Difficult People<br /><br />You know the old saying &quot;You can choose your friends, but you can't choose your family&quot;? You could say the same about your colleagues. You are unlikely to have any control over who your coworkers are and what they are like. A few—hopefully not too many—may have some annoying qualities. Whether you work with a chatterbox, a gossip, a delegator, a complainer or a credit grabber, your life will be much easier if you find a way to get along with him. More <br /><br />5  Don't Spread Malicious Gossip<br /><br />Based on rumor or fact, gossip can get you into trouble. Resist the urge to share juicy bits of news about anyone with whom you work. When you do, it sends a message to your coworkers that you aren't trustworthy, and they will wonder if they will be your next subject.<br /><br />While you should refrain from gossiping, you should know how to make the grapevine work for you. Listen to all the news that comes your way, filter out what is blatantly false and ignore anything that isn't helpful. More <br /><br />6  Practice Good Office Etiquette<br /><br />Good manners are as important on the job as they are anywhere else. This is an important point to remember whenever you are around your coworkers. Make sure to make phone calls in a way that doesn't distract anyone who is trying to work. Keep your voice down and, if possible, have private conversations away from others.<br /><br />Take care when writing or replying to email. Always say &quot;please&quot; when making a request and don't drive your coworkers crazy by hitting &quot;reply all&quot; in a group email when only the sender needs to see your response.<br /><br />Be mindful of proper table manners when eating lunch with your coworkers. For example, avoid tending to matters of personal hygiene at the table, put your cell phone away and be polite to waitstaff. <br /><br />7  Be Kind to Your Coworkers<br /><br />Everyone has bad days. Show your coworker some kindness when he seems to be struggling. You don't have to do something extravagant. How about offering to stay late to help him work on a big project with a looming deadline or bringing her coffee and a cookie on a dreary Monday morning? It won't make your colleague's problems disappear, but it could help him feel better<br /><br />There must be random acts of kindness going on in some workplaces but you wouldn't know it by reading some of the stories people share about their colleagues' bad behavior. Very rarely do we hear tales of people who go out of their way to do something nice for those with whom they work. Is it that such acts are a rarity in the workplace or is it more likely that we, as humans, just like to complain?<br /><br />What if you could do something that would give one of your coworkers one of those rare stories to tell? Would they spread the word about your random act of kindness? How about giving it a whirl? Try doing one of these nice things for someone in your workplace.<br /><br />* Bring your coworker a cup of coffee when she looks like she needs a pick-me-up.<br />* Share your mid-afternoon snack with him or if you don't want to share, bring an extra one (everyone gets hungry a couple of hours after lunch).<br />* Buy your coworker her favorite iced cold beverage on the first warm day of the year.<br />* Celebrate Friday—or make Monday more bearable—by bringing in a treat for the entire department. Or maybe choose to do this on a rainy day to cheer everyone up.<br />* Offer to stay at work late or come in early to help a coworker with a difficult project (don't wait to be asked).<br />* Praise him for a job well done. No one can get too many compliments.<br />* Take a difficult customer off your coworker's hands by saying you're there to relieve him for lunch or a break (it doesn't have to be true).<br />* If you see someone is about to make a mistake, try to intervene to prevent it.<br />* Offer unsolicited advice, especially to a new colleague who seems to be floundering.<br />* Stop others from spreading a rumor about someone.<br />* If you see something you know your colleague will absolutely love, a book about a topic in which he's interested for example (nothing too extravagant), get it for him.<br />* Include a less experienced colleague in a meeting or on a project that can help her grow.<br />* Invite him to join your lunch group especially if he doesn't have many workplace friends.<br />* Stop by her desk to say good morning.<br />* Stop by his desk to say goodbye.<br />* Hold the (otherwise unoccupied) elevator while your colleague runs back to her desk to get something she forgot even if you're in a hurry to leave the building.<br />* Praise her to the boss who may not realize how hard she's working.<br />* Save him a trip to the office supply closet by offering to pick up his supplies when you get yours.<br />* Offer to  mentor an inexperienced coworker. Many people are too shy to ask or may not even think of it.<br />* Put your colleague's bully in her place or lend a sympathetic ear and give him advice on how to deal with one.<br />* Tell a coworker about an internal job opening for which you think she'd be perfect.<br />* Pack an extra brown bag lunch for a coworker who can't ever seem to remember to bring his own.<br />* Have an errand to run in your coworker's neighborhood after work? Offer her a ride home so she doesn't have to take the bus or train that day.<br />* Offer to relieve him or one of his undesirable tasks for a day or more (as long as you clear it with the boss).<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion</span><br />1. If you are new in the company, what would you do to get along with others? <br />2. Do you prefer to work with others? or work alone? why or why not? <br />3. If you have colleagues, would you like to befriend with them?</div>
