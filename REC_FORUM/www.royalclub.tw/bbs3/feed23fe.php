Tks to all .<br /><br />The Moon Confuses Scientists<br />The moon, how many years has it been following the earth? Perhaps before there were no humans on the earth, it was looking at the earth every day. In the past, everyone said that there was a Guanghan Palace in the moon, and there lived an ancient beauty - Chang'e, a white rabbit, and Wu Gang, who was cutting down osmanthus trees every day. However, on July 19, 1969, the U.S. Helios 11 spacecraft landed on the moon, but did not see Guanghan Palace, did not find Chang'e and White Rabbit, let alone Guishu and Wu Gang, so many people's beautiful fantasy became a scientific disappointment . However, it has been 26 years since astronauts landed on the moon. Humans' understanding of the moon has not increased. On the contrary, scientists have become more and more ignorant of the information obtained from the instruments left by the astronauts on the moon. Confused, whenever I look up at the moon at night, I have a complex emotion that is both familiar and unfamiliar, and I can't help but ask: the moon! Can you tell us the truth about you?<br /><br />In 1970, Russian scientists Alexander Scherbakov and MihKai Vasin proposed a shocking &quot;spaceship moon&quot; theory to explain the origin of the moon. They believe that the moon is not actually a natural satellite of the earth, but a star that has been transformed by some kind of intelligent creature. It is excavated and transformed into a spacecraft. It contains a lot of information about the civilization. The moon was intentionally placed on the earth. In the sky, all the mysterious discoveries of the moon are the masterpieces of the higher creatures that still live in the interior of the moon.<br /><br />Questions:<br /><br />1. At night time when you look up the moon what do you think? Do you feel fascinating  ?<br />2. What’s your comments on this  article ？<br />3. How do like it if  you get the chance to move to the Moon ?<br />4. Do you think people can face the truth of Moon if there are aliens on the Moon ?<br />5. Free conversation as you like....<br /><br /><br />P.S.<br />1.參加三次(含實體及線上會議)後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />2.請帶著開放的心與熱情來參加全英文會話聚會!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38674">Louie Wang</a> — Sat Oct 08, 2022 4:26 pm</p><hr />
