In 2016, researchers from the<br />University of Pennsylvania and Ohio State University studied call center staff working for an<br />insurance company[1].<br />They specifically looked at the mood of the call center staff throughout their working day. The threeweek study discovered something interesting. Namely, staff who started the day in a bad mood<br />usually ended the day in a bad mood. This was despite them receiving calls from positive customers<br />throughout the day.<br />Staff who started their day calm or happy finished their working day in the same upbeat emotional<br />state. Furthermore, the study found that staff with low moods had low productivity. Staff with elevated<br />moods demonstrated high productivity.<br />As you can see from the above revelations, it’s vital that you start your day well with a great morning<br />routine.<br />If you’re prone to starting off your day in a gloomy and stressed state, then you’ll be sure to benefit<br />from the suggestions below.<br />1. Wake up on Time<br />Waking up on time (or waking up early) is critical to starting your day positively and keeping your<br />sleep cycle in check. It will give you space and time to complete your morning routines, and you won’t<br />need to worry about rushing around your home[2].<br />If you often hit the snooze button, set your alarm and put your phone at least a few feet away from<br />your bed so you have to get up to turn off the alarm in the morning.<br />2. Open Your Curtains<br />One of the first things you should do upon rising is to open your bedroom curtains to boost your early<br />morning motivation.<br />The human body clock depends highly on the sun and our exposure to it. When we wake up to<br />sunlight, we will naturally feel more energized, and our body clocks will be set for the day ahead[3].<br />3. Make Your Bed<br />Remember your student days? Making your bed was probably the last thing you thought about when<br />you were stumbling out of it in the morning.<br />This habit may be okay for students, but if you want to accelerate your motivation and productivity,<br />you should definitely make your bed.<br />It takes less than a minute, and you’ll be rewarded by a tidy room and a feeling of self-satisfaction.<br />4. Enjoy a Refreshing Shower<br />I’m always amazed when people tell me that they didn’t have time to shower in the morning.<br />A shower only takes 10 minutes or so, and it’s a great way to clean your body, and the perfect way to<br />wake up motivated.<br />5. Drink a Freshly-Blended Smoothie<br />Every morning, I enjoy a freshly-blended, fruit-based smoothie. This consists of organic milk and a<br />small portion of fruit, such as bananas, mangoes, or strawberries.<br />It’s a superb way to kick-start your day with morning motivation. Not only does it taste great, but it’s<br />also full of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals.<br />6. Take a 10-Minute Walk in the Morning Sunshine<br />If you have a dog, then this will be an easy task for you.<br />However, even if you don’t own a dog, why not try walking for 10 minutes outside every morning?<br />If you’re lucky enough to live close to a park, then you could walk around the park before going to<br />work. Fresh air and exercise are an invigorating combination that will set the tone for your whole day.<br />7. Check Your To-Do List<br />Organized people tend to have to-do lists. It helps them keep track of what needs doing at home,<br />work, and beyond.<br />To-do lists can be paper-based, or you can use one of the many free apps that are available. The<br />morning time is perfect for checking your to-do list and prioritizing items for the day.<br />You may also find that you can tick off some items that you completed the previous day.<br />8. Listen to Some Upbeat Music<br />Music is a powerful mood changer. If you’re not a typical morning person, you can boost your<br />morning motivation by listening to upbeat music.<br />Simply try to choose music that makes you feel happy and lively. You could listen to this music while<br />you shower, when you’re in your kitchen, or perhaps when you’re commuting to work.<br />Here’re also some for your inspirations: 30 Inspirational Songs that Keep You Motivated for Life<br />9. Complete a Mini Workout<br />If you have a home gym, then spend 30 minutes each morning working out. This will rapidly wake you<br />up and increase your mental well-being in the long term.<br />⌄ Scroll down to continue reading article ⌄<br />Want to Increase Your Motivation?<br />Take a Look at Lifehack's Actionable Motivation On Demand Handbook<br />- A self-driven program to gain sustainable motivation that brings tangible results.<br />If you don’t have a home gym, you can still do a mini workout. For example, try doing sets of pushups and sit-ups on a yoga mat.<br />10. Review Your Goals<br />Early morning can be an excellent time for contemplation.<br />While you may want to think about trivial things, successful people often use this time to review their<br />personal goals. You can do the same.<br />For instance, if one of your goals is to start your own business, then use the morning time to come up<br />with ideas to help move you towards this goal.<br />11. Pack Some Healthy Snacks to Take to Work<br />You may have started the day with a healthy breakfast, but have you noticed how easy it is for our<br />diets to go downhill from there!<br />As soon as we arrive at college or work, we begin looking for the coffee. Not long after that, we get<br />hungry and start seeking out cakes, cookies, and chocolate.<br />Luckily, with a bit of preparation, you can avoid this situation. The trick is to pack some healthy<br />snacks, such as apples, bananas, or nuts. These healthy treats will happily keep you going until<br />lunchtime.<br />12. Declutter Part of Your Home<br />Unless your home is currently spotless and has nothing out of place, then you could spend a few<br />minutes each morning decluttering an area of your home.<br />Take your hallway, for example. This may have shoes and bags that could be tidied away in just a<br />few minutes. With this bit of productivity, your morning motivation will skyrocket.<br />13. Meditate for 5 Minutes<br />Many high achievers say that they mediate each morning. This gives them balance and poise before<br />beginning their working day[4].<br />Have you thought about trying meditation? Although there are different forms of meditation, the<br />simplest method is to just close your eyes, control your breathing, and let your thoughts settle.<br />Like most things in life, the more you practice meditation, the easier it will become for you.<br />14. Stretch Your Body<br />You may have woken up with a stiff neck, or perhaps pain in your back.<br />Stretching for just a few minutes offers quick pain relief, improved posture and enhanced energy<br />levels[5].<br />15. Read a Motivational Quote<br />If you want to boost your productivity, then make a habit of reading a motivational quote each<br />morning.<br />To get you in the mood for adopting this behavior, I’ve picked out one of my favorite quotes for you:<br />“Always do your best. What you plant now, you will harvest later.” -Og Mandino<br />And here’re more<br />16. Drink a Glass of Water<br />Hydration is essential, especially after hours of sleeping. Water can reduce calorie intake throughout<br />the day, increase mental performance, and transport all the nutrients your body needs[6].<br />Even if you’re a caffeine addict, try drinking a glass of water before you start on the hard stuff.<br />17. Create Something<br />Let’s say that you are a budding singer-songwriter. You’re not famous yet, but you want to be!<br />Before heading off to do your current job, you could spend 20 minutes or so writing lyrics for a new<br />song. Do this everyday for a week, and you’ll probably have enough lyrics for a whole album.<br />Other ideas for creating something include putting together a bouquet of flowers, working on your<br />novel, or adding the finishing touches to your latest artwork. You’ll be surprised by how much this<br />helps your early morning motivation.<br />18. Write Down Things You’re Grateful for<br />It’s all too easy to take things for granted. We need to constantly remind ourselves of things in our life<br />that we’re grateful for.<br />A beneficial and rewarding morning practice is to write a list of things that you’re currently grateful for.<br />These could be things such as your partner, your job, and your health.<br />Some people like to write a list each morning that includes everything they were grateful for from the<br />previous day. Over time, you can develop an attitude of gratitude. Moreover, gratitude is an indicator<br />of overall well-being in life[7].<br />⌄ Scroll down to continue reading article ⌄<br />Get That Goal You've Always Wanted<br />Grab a FREE Lifehack Guide to start getting what you want!<br />Reach My Goal!<br />⌄ Scroll down to continue reading article ⌄<br />19. Play With Your Pets<br />If you’re fortunate enough to have a pet, then the morning is the perfect time to have some fun with<br />them.<br />For instance, if you have a dog, they’re sure to like playing with a ball or Frisbee first thing in the<br />morning. They’ll have fun, and you will, too.<br />20. Listen to an Inspiring Podcast<br />Podcasts are a great way to listen to inspiring speakers for some morning motivation.<br />As they’re audio only, you can listen to them while making your breakfast, or even while you’re driving<br />your car.<br />Just imagine hearing expert tips on business, success, and well-being every morning. Before long,<br />this precious wisdom is bound to sink into your consciousness.<br />Here’re some podcasts recommended for you:<br />21. Plan Your Day<br />Self-help guru Alan Lakein famously said:<br />“Failing to plan, is planning to fail.”<br />Wise words indeed.<br />To be successful in life, you must learn how to make plans and set goals. You can use a few minutes<br />each morning to plan the day ahead. It’s a simple technique that offers a surprising boost to your daily<br />productivity.<br />22. Learn Something New<br />Each morning is the start of a new day. Why not tap into this fresh energy by learning something<br />new every morning?<br />This could be something like a few words of a new language, a new guitar chord, or some facts<br />related to your favorite basketball team.<br />23. Enjoy the Quiet<br />If you can get up in the morning before the majority of other people, you’ll be rewarded with peace<br />and quiet.<br />You can make use of this special time by perhaps reading a book or sitting in your garden. Let the<br />quiet sink in before you get to the chaos of the day.<br />24. Think of a Way to Help Someone Later in the Day<br />Today’s society seems riddled with a me, me, me mentality.<br />It’s important not to get caught in this self-centered trend. One way to do this is to take a few minutes<br />each morning to think of ways that you can help other people later in the day.<br />To give you an example, you may have a colleague who has a sweet tooth. You could decide to take<br />some chocolates to work that you could share with this individual.<br />25. Go for a Swim<br />If you like to swim, and there is a swimming pool nearby, then this is a wonderful way to start your<br />day with some morning motivation.<br />Swimming pools are usually quiet in the morning, so you’re likely to have loads of space for serious<br />swimming, or simply having fun!<br />26. Meet Some Friends for Breakfast<br />Until I was in my 20s, I’d never thought about going out for breakfast with friends. However, I was<br />fortunate to be introduced to this idea by a couple of American friends who were staying with me in<br />London.<br />I distinctively remember them saying, “Where shall we go for breakfast?” I was taken aback because I<br />had always just had breakfast at home.<br />I’m glad they persuaded me, though, as I loved having breakfast with them in a local café. In fact, I<br />enjoyed it so much that I now regularly meet friends for breakfast. If you haven’t tried it before, give it<br />a go!<br />27. Check Yourself in the Mirror<br />I’ve heard people say that they don’t like to look in the mirror in the morning because they’re afraid of<br />what they might see.<br />I’m guessing that they probably look miserable and tired first thing in the morning, and want to avoid<br />been reminded of this. It’s understandable, but I think mirrors are a great tool to use in the morning.<br />Instead of being afraid of them, use them to check your appearance. You can quickly check your hair<br />and makeup (for example).<br />But more importantly, you can ensure that you’re looking alert, confident, and<br />purposeful.<br />28. Follow Steve Jobs’ Advice<br />In a speech he gave at Stanford University in 2005, Steve Jobs revealed that he started each day by<br />asking the following question:<br />“If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?”<br />He went on to say that, if the answer to the question was “no” for several days, then this told him that<br />he needed to make changes in his life.<br />29. Leave Plenty of Time for Your Commute<br />Rushing to work is the cause of so much stress and anxiety. One of the problems is that most people<br />seem to leave a set amount of time for their commute but don’t allow for any delays. When they<br />encounter one, their morning motivation is destroyed.<br />The resolution is simple: always allow more time than you need.<br />30. Kiss Your Loved Ones Before You Leave the House<br />Don’t be in so much of a hurry in the morning that you forget the most valuable people in your life.<br />Whether it’s your partner or your children, be sure to hug and kiss them before heading out the door.<br />Relationships are so important, so be certain to nurture yours.<br />The Bottom Line<br />Hopefully, the above list will give you plenty of food for thought.<br />I recommend that you pick out a handful of the above suggestions, and make them a part of your<br />daily routine.<br />By building these new habits, you’ll find that your days start happier and stronger. You’ll also discover<br />that you’re more motivated and productive than ever before.<br /><br />Questions:<br />1.Hopefully, the above list will give you plenty of food for thought. Which one is good for you<br />2.Do you like Take a 10-Minute Walk in the Morning Sunshine.<br />3.Is it a good idea to Meet Some Friends for Breakfast.<br />4.Do you have goal list and you can Review Your Goals list<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Session2: 10 Benefits of Hunger – The Fifth is the Greatest Benefit <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://aboutislam.net/spirituality/10-benefits-of-hunger-the-fifth-is-the-greatest-benefit/">https://aboutislam.net/spirituality/10- ... t-benefit/</a><!-- m --> <br />Abu Hamid Al-Ghazali 02 June, 2018 <br /><br />Know that one of the most difficult desires to overcome is that of the stomach because it is built into the natural human self. <br />Hunger has been given to humans so that they may nourish their body. However, if left uncontrolled, the appetite of the stomach will become one of the mortal vices, gluttony. <br />The way to break the desire of the stomach, is to prevent it from becoming full. In other words, maintaining a state of hunger. <br /><br />10 Benefits of Hunger Hunger has ten benefits: <br />1- Purifies the Heart Hunger purifies the heart and its spiritual perception. <br />2- Softens the Heart It softens the heart and renders it more receptive to divine grace. <br />3- Humbleness It humbles the ego. <br />4- Feeling the Poor It reminds one of the sufferings of the poor <br />5- Controlling Desires It weakens passion and enables one to control their desires, which is the greatest benefit. <br />6- Fighting Laziness It reduces the need for sleep. A full stomach leads to laziness. <br />7- Saving Time It frees up time that otherwise what have ever been spent in preparing and eating food. <br />8- Health and Fitness It has health benefits. Many deceases stem from overeating. <br />9- Money It saves money. <br />10- Generosity It makes one more generous. Know that the merit of hunger does not lie in hardship just as the merit of Medicine does not lie in its bitterness. <br /><br />Questions: <br />1.Do you think Hunger really purifies the heart and its spiritual perception. <br />2.Does hungry make you feel anxiety <br />3.Do you feel hungry some time, or you alwayse have food on hand. <br />4.Many deceases stem from overeating, is it true.</div>
