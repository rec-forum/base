Sometimes these changes are clear, and other times they're fuzzy, hard to define, and part of a bigger self-evolution. But how exactly will a volunteer trip abroad affect you, the volunteer?<br /><br />I can't say exactly how it will affect and change you, but I can help you evaluate your experience (if you've already returned) or think about the impact you will make (if you haven't yet left) by sharing how volunteering in India as an English teacher in 2011 changed my life -- or rather, is still changing my life.<br /><br />1. It Introduced Me to New Interests<br />I knew I was traveling to India to teach English at a primary school, but I didn't know it would spark new interests. For example, it wasn't until I traveled to India that I realized how much I loved learning about cultures so different than my own.<br /><br />It also taught me that I wasn't interested in certain things. Although I liked interacting with my students, I discovered that I didn't enjoy being a teacher. <br /><br />Thanks to my personal experience, I became passionate about spreading the word on responsible volunteerism. Now three years later, this interest has led me to my position here at Go Overseas as their Volunteer Abroad Director where I'm actively finding ways to educate others on responsible volunteering.<br /><br />2. It Helped Me Develop New Skills<br />Working in a different environment, culture, and industry gave me the chance to develop new personal and professional skills. I developed patience and improved my cross-cultural communication skills. By working with children, I gained leadership abilities and became more comfortable with public speaking.<br /><br />Surprisingly, my passion to write grew beyond just having a personal blog, and inspired me to pursue writing for other platforms as well. It's impossible to know whether or not I would have eventually discovered and worked on developing this skill or not, but I can confidently say volunteering abroad set it into motion.<br /><br />3. It Helped Make Me More Worldly and Culturally Sensitive<br />When volunteering internationally, I worked with local coordinators, program directors, teachers, and students. Their knowledge, education, and experiences were entirely different than my own, which at first made it more difficult to relate.<br /><br />However, after spending more time interacting with the locals, I began to understand more about their culture which in turn helped build relationships and ultimately make me a more worldly and culturally aware person.<br /><br />4. It Taught Me to Appreciate the Little Things<br />I know it sounds cliché, but living in a third world country -- even for just a short trip -- truly helped me understand how much we take for granted in the United States.<br /><br />Seeing how others live with limited food, dirty drinking water, basic, thatched-huts, or easily preventable illnesses absolutely made me think twice the next time I got frustrated because my car wouldn't start or my air conditioning stopped working. In the grand scheme of things, these problems aren't that big a deal.<br />Likewise, I'm so much more appreciative of the &quot;the little things&quot; in life. I'm lucky enough to have access to health care, water, food, and good house. We tend to see these things as basics, but they're not for everyone.<br /><br />This is why, even with all the voluntourism criticism, I still believe it’s important for people to immerse themselves in an environment drastically different than their own -- whether it's as a volunteer, a student, or a gap-yearer. Immersing ourselves in different cultures can open all of our eyes to what’s really important in life.<br /><br />5. I Made an International Network of Friends<br />Although my focus was on my work in the local community, I also worked alongside a group of international volunteers and eventually became close friends. These people not only taught me about their countries, but have remained an invaluable network years after.<br /><br />Without some of the great people I met volunteering abroad, I wouldn’t know as much about the German education system, or how to make money on a working visa in Australia, or the best places to visit on a road trip in British Columbia.<br /><br />By residing with my fellow volunteers from France, Italy, Portugal, Germany, and Canada, and keeping in touch and visiting them after the volunteer project was over, these friendships have helped me understand other cultures, made me a more informed person, and extended my travel network tenfold.<br /><br />6. It Changed My Perspective on Gender and Women's Rights<br />After visiting India I learned and experienced firsthand some of the issues it's struggling with. It has a male dominated society and women are often excluded from educational or career opportunities. There were several occasions in which my male program director would direct questions or instructions at the other male volunteer, completely ignoring my presence.<br /><br />Although sexism is present throughout the world, I had never had to deal with such blatant disregard simply because I'm a woman. Putting myself in this position completely changed my perception of the issue.<br /><br />Being aware of what goes on in the world unfortunately means being exposed to negative and heart breaking stories. Volunteering abroad is a similar experience. There were plenty of wonderfully uplifting things I saw, but I also inevitably became aware of the inherent issues that exist in India and other developing countries -- especially when it came to women's rights, the impact of living in a politically unstable country, and low quality of living.<br /><br />7. It Taught Me to be More Aware of Global News<br />I've never followed the news too closely, but after living in places like India, Thailand, and Tanzania, I find myself searching for these countries in news headlines and wanting to keep up with events there.<br /><br />It’s important to me, but also socially responsible, to be aware of what's going on beyond our own borders. Volunteering abroad inspired me to be more proactive about following the news, which in turn as led me to be more concerned about certain social issues and sharing what I know.<br /><br />8. I’m Not a Superhero and Never Will Be<br />My initial vision of what volunteering abroad looked like included lots of smiles, sharing my knowledge to those in need, and making a tangible difference in people's lives.<br /><br />It wasn't until long after I left India that I began to realize how naive and irresponsible it is to think that a single volunteer can change the world.<br /><br />The major lesson I learned was: the sooner I can come to terms with the fact that the world is not perfect, the sooner I can stop trying to make it so, and the sooner I can focus on the small bit I can do.<br /><br />9. It Helped Me Accept My Flaws<br />The toughest lesson of them all, however, was admitting and accepting my own personal flaws. It sounds harsh, but if there's anything I took from my time volunteering in India, it’s that I wasn't as selfless as I first thought.<br /><br />How? The challenges of living in a developing country brought out some of my worse characteristics.<br />I found myself continually frustrated when things didn’t happen how I thought they should. The bus on the way to school took an hour instead of 30 minutes because of all the potholes. The water at all the restaurants was warm instead of refrigerated. I couldn't go for drinks with the other volunteers because women weren't allowed in bars. I let all of these differences bother me, instead of being open to adjusting to them.<br /><br />I was too self-absorbed to recognize that I wasn't in my country and that it was ridiculous to expect others to adapt to the way my country did things. It took me a long time (ok, I confess, I still struggle with it) to accept that just because something is done differently, doesn’t mean it’s wrong.<br /><br />It was scary to put myself in that position but by dealing with these challenges, instead of remaining frustrated, I learned invaluable lessons about myself, lessons that are still changing my thoughts, beliefs, and actions today.<br /><br />The Changes Don't Stop When You Come Home<br />In the end though, I don't think there is one ultimate, definable change that happens to someone in the volunteer role -- and there shouldn't be. Constantly trying to first recognize and second be open to these changes is what makes the long term positive effects from volunteering stronger and more influential.<br />I can safely say that I am not a perfectly humble, generous, understanding, patient, informed, empathetic, and changed person just because I volunteered. But I’m getting there.<br /><br />Discussions : <br />Q1. Have you ever done any volunteer work? Or have you ever heard any inspiring volunteer story?<br />Q2. Is volunteering worth the time it takes?<br />Q3. What could you do to help if you had no money?<br />Q4. What are volunteer activities that people do?<br />Q5. What things can people learn from volunteer work?<br /><br />============================================================================================<br />7 Tips for Foreign Business Travel<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.inc.com/guides/201103/7-tips-for-foreign-business-travel.html">https://www.inc.com/guides/201103/7-tip ... ravel.html</a><!-- m --><br />Maximize your time spent overseas. Proper preparation before your departure will not only make your business trip a safe one but more productive. By Carolyn M. Brown<br /> <br />Preparing for international travel is unlike planning a business trip within one's own country. There are some basic guidelines such as preparing proper documents two or three months before your departure, especially if visas and updated passports are needed (for instance an old photo may not cut it). Some countries may not require visas for tourists but may require them for business travelers. Of course, depending on the country you are visiting, you will want to consult a physician about necessary vaccinations. <br /><br />For US Travelers, a great resource is the US Department of State, says Kaufman, especially if something goes wrong in a foreign country and you need a quick evacuation. When the earthquake occurred in Japan, travelers couldn't get back into their rooms to access pertinent documents, says Donna Thomas, owner of New Zealand Travel, in Langhorne, Pennsylvania. &quot;The big lesson learned: When you go to dinner or a meeting, take your passport, don't leave it back in your hotel room. Carry contact information for your embassy with you at all times. Keep a fully charged cell phone on you,&quot; she explains. <br /><br />Besides personal safety, you also will want to prepare for your foreign business encounters. After all, you want to get maximum value for the time that is spent abroad. This means you have to be open to different values, behaviors and ways of doing business.<br /> <br />1. Prepare a well-planned itinerary. <br />A well thought out itinerary should reflect what your company hopes to accomplish. Think about your goals and relative priorities. For instance, you will want to have two or three appointments confirmed well in advance and spaced comfortably throughout the day. This will be more productive and enjoyable than a crowded agenda that forces you to rush from one meeting to the next. Your schedule should be flexible enough to allow for unexpected problems such as transportation delays and/or opportunities such as an unplanned luncheon invitation. <br /><br />Kaufman suggests leaving a copy of your itinerary with trusted colleagues, family members or close friends so that they know where you are supposed to be at all times. Also provide a family member or spouse with copies of your passport, medical insurance card, and other pertinent information. In addition, leave an emergency contact list with your travel planner. <br /><br />2. Seek information on the culture. <br />Invest some time in learning about the history, culture and customs of the countries to be visited, says Thomas. Attend cross-cultural seminars or training. Read books about that country. Brush up on the differences in negotiating styles, attitudes towards punctuality, gift-giving customs, and the proper use of names and titles (understand the importance of rank and know who the decision makers are when conducting business). <br /><br />Take the Japanese, for instance, who consider it rude to be late for a business meeting but acceptable for a social occasion. In Latin countries, being late for a business meeting is more tolerable. In the Middle East it is commonplace to engage in small talk before conducting business. The French and the British have different views about discussing business during meals, Thomas says. &quot;Do you talk about business during dinner or do you wait until after you have eaten your meal? The slightest things can really offend people,&quot; she says. <br /><br />3. Learn protocol and etiquette practices. <br />Study the general protocol and etiquette of the country or countries you're visiting. Understanding in advance how to greet your counterparts and manage appointments will be most helpful. Check normal work days and business hours. In the Middle East, for example, the workweek is Saturday to Thursday. It is not uncommon in many countries for lunch to last two to four hours. Also take into account foreign holidays. Business manners, religious customs, dietary practices, humor and acceptable dress vary widely from country to country. <br /><br />Misunderstandings over gestures and body language can cause you more than embarrassment but can lead to business complications, says Thomas. For instance, the okay sign (thumb and index fingers forming a circle with the other fingers pointing upward) is commonly used in the US. But it means zero in France and Thomas says it is a vulgar gesture in Brazil and the Philippines (like giving the middle finger is here in the States). She recommends finding a local person from the host country whom you can openly talk to and learn about customs. Or a good travel planner will know the ins and outs of the country. <br /><br />4. Learn the native tongue. <br />Business associates will appreciate any sincere attempt. Study the language or hire a translator, especially if the persons you are meeting with do not speak English or are uncomfortable speaking it. You can learn a foreign language on the go using Praxis Mobile Language Learning Networks, which provides podcasts for Chinese, Spanish, French and Italian. You can listen to and interact with language lessons with an MP3 player, iPod, mobile phone, computer for internet access, television, and CD. Colleges or universities in your area may offer traditional classroom instruction or immersion programs. Other options are audio language lessons and software programs such as those available from Rosetta Stone. Seek out someone who knows the language that can help you learn it by holding conversations. <br /><br />There may even be subtle differences in the same language, cautions Thomas. &quot;Certain words in English that we use freely could have different meanings outside the US.&quot; She cites a situation between American and British businessmen. &quot;During the meeting the Americans said, 'lets table' this, hoping to end the discussion, but the Brits kept on talking. The Americans took this as utter disregard and stormed out, not knowing that in England the expression 'let's table it' means to put it on the table for discussion.&quot;<br /><br />5. Check travel advisories. <br />Governments issue advisories about safety concerns that may affect travel to a particular country or region. Travel advisories are released for various reasons, including terrorism, natural disasters, political unrest, wars, health emergencies, and outbreaks of violent crimes against tourists. Check to see if the advisory applies to the entire country or certain areas. &quot;Know your geography,&quot; says Thomas. An incident in Okinawa may not impact someone traveling to Hiroshima. &quot;Make your decision to travel with informed knowledge,&quot; she adds. <br /><br />Have a backup plan in case something does go wrong. Find out whether your home country has an embassy or consulate in the place you are visiting. Make sure it is fully staffed and functioning. If the worst happens, you don't want to be stranded in a foreign country without an embassy to help with emergency evacuation or get in contact with your family and friends back home. Be aware of what the embassy can or cannot do. For example, if you are injured the State Department can help you get back home but the cost of medical care comes out of your pocket. <br /><br />6. Protect yourself. <br />Kaufman recommends getting travel insurance. &quot;With Road Warrior you can get a yearlong policy as opposed to a trip-by-trip basis. Insurance companies are there to help you out in a crisis such as medical evacuations,&quot; he says. Following the earthquake and Tsunami, one-way airfare out of Japan cost $5,000. So, &quot;travel insurance will help mitigate any financial loss you might incur.&quot;<br /><br />Keep in mind that different destinations pose different risks; incorporate that into your strategy for choosing business travel insurance. Do your research. Travel insurance may not cover you in all countries and in all circumstances. Most policies do not cover acts of war, riots or civil disorder. Find out what exclusions apply. <br /><br />Check with your health plan carrier to see if you need to get another policy to cover medical costs for an injury or sudden illness abroad, says Thomas. What if you need to be airlifted by helicopter and taken to the hospital, are you still covered? Look into the large travel insurance companies such as Travel Guard. <br /><br />7. Plan to stay connected. <br />A plug or adapter may be needed to charge notebooks, cell phones, and PDAs while overseas. Also, contact your cell phone provider before you leave to find out about international options for business trips, says Kaufman. You may be able to get a temporary plan while you are visiting another country. To make an international call from your cell phone, your carrier network must be compatible with that country. Your phone also must be technically capable of making international calls. <br /><br />Other options are to use Skype on your laptop or a Skype iPhone app to make international calls. You also can rent a cell phone in airport malls around the world from companies such as TripTel or online from sites such as Cellularabroad.com. <br /><br />If you are traveling to a foreign destination for more than a week or two, consider buying a local phone, suggests Kaufman. You can use that phone for making calls within the host country and it may prove to be less expensive. &quot;Some business travelers also use local SIM cards because it makes communications by mobile phones a lot easier.&quot; <br /><br />Just make sure that you have texting capability. Kaufman says text communication is a lot more reliable than voice communication because it requires less bandwidth. So, during the earthquake in Japan, phone calls weren't going through but people were able to send text messages to their loved ones.<br /><br />Discussion :<br />Q1. How do you plan and arrange your foreign business travel in general?<br />Q2. Have you encountered any cultural shock while travelling?<br />Q3. Have you ever been in a difficult situation while traveling?<br />Q4. Did you find anything of particular interest while traveling?<br />Q5. What things do you always need to take good care of while travelling?</div>
