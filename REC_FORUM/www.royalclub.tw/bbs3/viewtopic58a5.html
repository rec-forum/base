I shake all the time,&quot; Maysoon Zayid announces at the beginning of this exhilarating, hilarious talk.

In this hilarious and insightful talk, Urban takes us on a journey through YouTube binges, Wikipedia rabbit holes and bouts of staring out the window -- and encourages us to think harder about what we're really procrastinating on, before we run out of time.<br /><br />Questions:<br />1.Are you a procrastinator? Or are you a rational decision maker?<br /><br />2.Do you have any example for procrastination?<br /><br />3.Do you have any suggestions for improving procrastination?<br /><br />4.The speaker mentioned that there is no deadline for seeing your family, exercising and taking care of your healthy. So it is difficult to notice this long term kind of procrastination, do you have any solution to it?</div>
