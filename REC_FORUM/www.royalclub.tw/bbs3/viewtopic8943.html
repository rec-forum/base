I'm in a whale's mouth, and he's trying to swallow me.'&quot;<br />&quot;I thought to myself, 'OK, this is it. I'm going to die.' And I thought about my kids and my wife,&quot; he said. &quot;There was no getting out of there.&quot;<br />After what Packard estimated to be about 30 seconds in the mammal's mandibles, he said the whale surfaced quickly and spit him out.<br />&quot;All of a sudden he went up to the surface and just erupted and started shaking his head,&quot; Packard said. &quot;I just got thrown in the air, and landed in the water and I was free and I just floated there.&quot;<br />&quot;I couldn't believe it,&quot; he added. &quot;I couldn't believe I got out of that. And I'm here to tell it.&quot;<br />'A surprise to all involved'<br />Packard was pulled out of the water by a crewmate, rushed ashore, and taken to a nearby hospital. In the end, Packard said, he was &quot;all bruised up,&quot; but whole.<br />Biologist Jooke Robbins, the director of Humpback Whale Studies at Provincetown's Center for Coastal Studies, said the unusual encounter was most likely an accident.<br />&quot;We don't really see humpback whales doing anything like this normally,&quot; Robbins told CNN. &quot;I think it was a surprise to all involved.&quot;<br />Robbins said that Humpbacks often engage in so-called &quot;lunge feeding,&quot; in which a fast moving whale tries to gather a large volume of food in its mouth quickly.<br />&quot;When they do that, they don't necessarily see everything,&quot; she said.<br />She added that Packard was unlikely to have been swallowed, as, despite their massive mouths, their throats aren't large enough for a person to fit through.<br />Charles Mayo, also a marine biologist at the Center for Coastal Studies, agreed.<br />&quot;It's a little like sitting down to a really nice meal, and into your mouth flies a fly,&quot; he told CNN.<br />Mayo said his son, Josiah, is the captain on Packard's boat, responsible for tracking the diver's movements by his air bubbles. Mayo told CNN he was there when his son brought Packard ashore, and emergency services immobilized him and brought him to the hospital.<br />Mayo, like Robbins, could not recall a similar situation in which a diver ended up in a humpback's mouth.<br />Packard was in real danger, Mayo said, if not from the whale's gullet, then from the air pressure in his own lungs as the whale surfaced to spit him out.<br />&quot;If you come up to atmospheric pressure, and you've held your breath, you could develop an embolism,&quot; Mayo said.<br />&quot;He must have kept his cool,&quot; Mayo said. &quot;To get out of a situation like that you have to be a top pro.&quot;<br />&quot;The reason he's still around is because he's smart,&quot; Mayo said of Packard. &quot;He's a smart guy, he's a tough guy, and he's a lucky guy.&quot;<br /><br />Q1:Do you ever try diving?<br />Q2:How can you survive that if you are swallowed by a whale?<br />Q3:what will you do that if u really survive?<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/11/us/cape-cod-diver-eaten-by-whale/index.html">https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/11/us/c ... index.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Article2:<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Dangerous Covid variants could set back national progress against the pandemic, officials warn</span><br /><br />(CNN)With declining rates of Covid-19 infections and deaths across the US, more cities and states have lifted safety restrictions in anticipation of a better summer.<br />But officials continue to warn that those unvaccinated remain vulnerable to the virus, especially to dangerous variants which could set back national progress against the pandemic if they become more widespread.<br />Nationwide, 64% of adults have received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine and about 54% are fully vaccinated, yet the Biden administration's goal of having 70% of adults with at least one dose of vaccine by July 4 will fall short at the current pace.<br />More than a dozen states have hit that goal as of this week, according to the CDC.<br />But the number of people nationwide who have been vaccinated each week has been declining. The CDC's total of all people receiving vaccine doses increased by only 822,177 on Friday, and the average for the past seven days is just 1.05 million doses each day.<br /><br />Barriers to access along economic lines, vaccine hesitancy and misinformation have been cited as contributing factors to a slowing of vaccination rates in the US from earlier highs.<br />&quot;This kind of doubting the safety of vaccines, doubting the necessity of vaccines ... it is very, very dangerous, and a lot of people are hearing this,&quot; CNN medical analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner said.<br /><br />As officials try to quicken the rate of vaccination, recent data gives further credence that vaccines are some of the best tools to fight against variants that could otherwise exacerbate the pandemic.<br />Two doses of Pfizer/BioNTech's coronavirus vaccine appear to provide good protection against some of the worrisome new variants circulating, including the B.1.617.2 or Delta variant first seen in India, researchers reported Thursday.<br />&quot;New variants will continue to emerge as the pandemic persists,&quot; researchers said, noting there has been no evidence that variants have largely escaped such vaccine protections.<br />&quot;Therefore, increasing the proportion of the population immunized with current safe and effective authorized vaccines remains a key strategy to minimize the emergence of new variants and end the Covid-19 pandemic.&quot;<br /><br />Q1:Do you think covid 19 vaccine is safe?<br />Q2:What the side effects of the covid 19 vaccine?<br />Q3:What should I do if I have side effects of the vaccination after?<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/11/health/us-coronavirus-friday/index.html">https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/11/heal ... index.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />P.S.<br />1.參加三次後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />2.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~</div>
