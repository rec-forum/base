			<div class="content">15 totally achievable New Year’s resolutions that won’t make you feel a failure<br />1.Allow others joy<br />We moan a lot about things that don’t affect us, especially on social media. Baby updates, people excited about snow, taking photos of their lunch. I’m particularly bad for this kind of misanthropic whingeing. But does it really matter? Just scroll on and leave them to it. Let people find joy in things and you may find yourself a little happier as a result. And it’s absolutely free.<br />2. Lose Weight<br />This is a perennial favorite for many resolution makers, and it doesn’t take much to figure out why.The holiday season is a time to overeat and indulge and things might come to a head, with many people reaching their fat-gain breaking point after a New Year’s Eve buffet dinner.<br />3. Travel More<br />It’s tempting to want to get out and see more of the world, especially if you feel stuck in your rut or you haven’t been anywhere lately. This is one of the most common resolutions, just be sure to be a bit more specific on where you want to go because vague ideas rarely get done, but attainable goals are something you can work with.<br />4. Get a Health Check Up<br />If you’ve been putting off the annual check-up and it’s been awhile since you’ve been given a clean bill of health, you may want to resolve to going in for a doctor’s visit. Starting the year off without having to worry about a serious medical condition looming in the background is one way to make it great.<br />5. Stop Eating Fast Food<br />It seems like each year we learn more about just how bad fast food is for the body. If you’ve resolved to lose weight or get a six pack, you’ll definitely want to drop the fast food habit cold turkey. It can be hard because all of the fat, sugars, and chemical additives make it darn near addictive.<br />6. Validate People In My Life More<br />It’s easy to take the important people in your life for granted, especially if you see them every day. You don’t have to get all mushy every time you’re around them, but taking the time to let them know how important they are to you on an occasional basis will make you feel good and will strengthen the relationship.<br />7. Stop Judging People<br />“Judge not lest ye be judged.” It’s in the Bible, but people of all faiths and beliefs can subscribe to this one. If you’re sitting in judgment it probably represents an insecurity on your part. Spend less time worrying about others, and spend more time improving yourself.<br />8. Stop Hating Myself<br />It’s easy to be hard on yourself, and many of us are our own biggest critics. It’s possible to ease up on yourself while still holding yourself to high standards.<br />9. Find a Girlfriend/Boyfriend<br />Finding love is no easy chore, and keep in mind that many times you find that special someone when you stop looking. Perhaps it might be best to work on self-improvement so you can attract them automatically.<br />10. Get More Sleep<br />Sleep is one of the most important things you can do for your well-being, but many of us stay up into the wee hours, and wake up before we’re fully rested. Try following the circadian rhythm by getting to bed early and waking up early. You’ll notice a big improvement right away.<br />11. Start a Savings Account or IRA<br />In a turbulent economy it both more important and harder to squirrel some money away for a rainy or rainier day, or for your retirement. But even putting away a small amount of money each week or each month can add up over the long run, and can be the difference between having some cash in a pinch or having the retirement you really want.<br />12. Reconnect with an Old Friend<br />Nowadays it’s easier than ever to find old friends and strike up a new conversation with them. It often happens that two people can drift apart for no good reason, and it just takes one of them to rekindle things.<br />13. Stop Procrastinating<br />Perhaps there’s lots of things on this list that you’ve already promised yourself you’d stop or start doing, but you just haven’t gotten around to doing it. At some point you’ve got to make it your priority and make time for it.<br />14. Don’t Buy the Latest iPhone<br />Chances are the gadget you currently have works just fine, and does all it said it would when you first bought it. While it’s easy to get swept up in the craze for the latest and greatest, why not take a year off and skip a generation so you will really notice the upgrade?<br />15. Worry Less<br />This is a pretty vague goal, and since it’s putting pressure on yourself to stop doing something that’s hard to control, it’s doubly hard. Worrying about how much you worry is no solution. Instead, why not resolve yourself to get more massages, or pet your cat more.<br />37. Have More Family Fun Nights<br />With so many board games to choose from, how can you go wrong? Try Phase 10, Sequence, or the old standby of Monopoly for some serious family bonding.<br />Questions:<br />1.	Which one of the New Year’s resolution the article mentioned above is your favorite one?<br />2.	What are your New Year’s resolutions? Are they all achievable or just part of your wishful thinking?<br />3.	How would you make your goals work? <br />4.	What do you expect yourself to be in three years in terms of your career, family relationships, marriage or your bank account etc.?<br /><br /><br />First ‘space out’ competition held in Taiwan to promote stress-free lifestyle<br /><br />Contestants had to stare into space for hours without using smartphones<br />TAIPEI (Taiwan News) – The International version of &quot;space out&quot; competition was held on Sunday (Dec. 10) in Taipei with the aim of encouraging young people to practice a stress-free lifestyle, reported CNA.<br />The &quot;space out&quot; contest was invented in 2012 by South Korean visual artist Woops Yang to highlight how much people overwork their brains and how much they stand to gain by taking a break.<br />It is the first international version of the competition and in Taiwan was held at the Eslite Spectrum Songyan Store in the Taipei Songshan Cultural and Creative Park. According to the rules, contestants had to stare blankly for long hours without talking, sleeping, laughing or using smartphones.<br />Before the event began, Yang advised contestants that they should not worry about what others might be thinking during the 80-minute competition.<br />The winner, who received the most votes from audiences in the form of red dot stickers, was a 24-year-old student from Hong Kong, named Chan Kai Ho (陳棨豪). In an interview with CNA, he shared his secret of winning the competition was to &quot;find a place to look at and keep staring at it.&quot;<br />During their busy modern lives, many people are under heavy pressure to make ends meet and do not have any respite. Therefore, the organizers hope participants in the event can learn to save some time for themselves to think of what they really want in life.<br />Questions:<br />Here’s definition of spaced out from the Cambridge dictionary “Someone who is spaced out is not completely conscious of what is happening, often because of taking drugs or needing to sleep” <br />While a netizen said “spacing out is also like daydreaming most of the time when people space out means there in deep thought about something that interesting or something that might be troubling them most, people are smart when they space out but might be called dumb, because they often appear with a blank look on their face “, <br />1.	which one of the definition do you agree when the two seems quiet contradictory? What is your own definition?<br />2.	If you wanted to join the competition, what would you do to win the game (stay still longer or appear a blank face or dress funny). <br />3.	Do you do meditation? Is spaced out part of it? how about yoga? What are the difference of them? <br />4.	Do you like daydreaming? Do you agree or not that daydreaming sometimes gets people to think infinite and ambitious? Do you stop your kids from daydreaming? <br />5.	What do you do when you feel stressed-out?<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />tel: 2255-8132<br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
