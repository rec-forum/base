Session I:Japan's NHK sued over use of English words<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-23079067">https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-23079067</a><!-- m --><br /><br />A disgruntled viewer is suing Japan's national broadcaster for &quot;mental distress&quot; caused by an excessive use of words borrowed from English.<br />Hoji Takahashi, 71, is seeking 1.4 million yen ($14,300; £9,300) in damages from NHK.<br />&quot;The basis of his concern is that Japan is being too Americanised,&quot; his lawyer Mutsuo Miyata told the news agency AFP.<br /><br />English became more prevalent in Japan after World War II during the US-led occupation.<br />This was followed by a growing interest in American pop culture.<br />The country's modern vocabulary is littered with borrowed words, many of which are changed to fit the Japanese phonic structure.<br /><br />Complaint<br />Mr Takahashi, who is a member of a campaign group supporting the Japanese language, highlighted words such as &quot;toraburu&quot; (trouble), &quot;risuku&quot; (risk) and &quot;shisutemu&quot; (system) in NHK's news and entertainment programmes.<br /><br />He accused NHK of irresponsibility by refusing to use native Japanese equivalents.<br />&quot;With Japanese society increasingly Americanised, Takahashi believes that NHK, as Japan's national broadcaster, shouldn't go with the trend, but remain determined to prioritise the use of Japanese, which he thinks would go a long way toward protecting Japanese culture,&quot; Mr Miyata told the Japan Times on Wednesday.<br />Mr Takahashi filed his complaint on Tuesday with the Nagoya District Court in the central Chubu region of Japan, the newspaper said.<br /><br />NHK said it would not comment until it had studied the legal documents.<br /><br />Other examples of English words often used in Japanese include:<br />terebi (TV)<br />rajio (radio)<br />konpuraiansu (compliance)<br />koraboreeshon (collaboration)<br />dejitaru (digital)<br />taoru (towel)<br /><br />Vocabulary is also borrowed from other foreign languages. The German &quot;arbeit&quot; becomes &quot;arubaito&quot; to mean work, and the Portuguese &quot;pao&quot; is used as &quot;pan&quot; for bread.<br />Traditionalists in France and French-speaking Canada also worry about the influx of English words into their native tongue.<br />France's 1994 Toubon Law makes French compulsory in government publications, most workplaces, advertisements, parts of the media and state-funded schools.<br />However, the French parliament is debating relaxing these rules so that university courses can be taught in English.<br />Japanese words used in the English language include &quot;haiku&quot;, &quot;origami&quot; and &quot;Bonsai&quot;.<br />Other commonly used &quot;loanwords&quot; are the German &quot;kindergarten&quot;, &quot;zeitgeist&quot; and &quot;blitz&quot; as well as French terms such as &quot;faux-pas&quot;, &quot;decor&quot; and &quot;cafe&quot;.<br /><br />Questions:<br />1.Why does Japanese TV choose loanwords instead of Japanese?<br />2.What do you think of Mr Takahashi's feelings?<br />3.Are there any English loanwords in your language you love or hate?<br />4.Can loanwords help you understand more English words?<br />5.Many languages might be half English in the future. Is this good or bad?<br /><br />Session II: Parents Raising Children Vegan Should Be Prosecuted,<br />Claim Belgian Doctors<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.plantbasednews.org/post/parents-raising-children-vegan-prosecuted">https://www.plantbasednews.org/post/par ... prosecuted</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The Royal Academy of Medicine of Belgium published a legal opinion arguing that veganism is 'unsuitable for unborn children, children, teenagers, and pregnant and lactating women'.<br /><br />'Not ethical to impose on children'<br />One of the professors behind the report, Georges Casimir, says vegan parenting now qualifies as 'non-assistance to a person in danger' - a criminal offense that carries a prison sentence of up to two years.<br />Casimir claims children need 'higher requirements for protein and essential fatty acids' but that the body 'does not produce them' naturally - arguing the nutrients must be 'brought in via animal products'.<br />He added: &quot;This concept of nutrition is similar to a form of treatment that it is not ethical to impose on children.&quot;<br /><br />'Nutritionally adequate'<br />However, the American Dietetic Association state: &quot;Appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.<br />&quot;Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.&quot;<br /><br />'Ignorant codswallop!'<br />The news caused controversy amongst animal-rights organization PETA who, according to the Telegraph, said: &quot;What a load of ignorant codswallop! NHS nutritionists confirm that while a meat- and dairy-based diet is what strikes people down in adulthood – as it can lead to hardened arteries that cause stroke, brain aneurysms, and heart attacks – a well-planned vegan diet is perfect for babies and children.<br />&quot;Kids, including my own, thrive on a balanced vegan diet, but as with any dietary regime, it's the parent's responsibility to ensure their child is getting all the necessary nutrients.&quot;<br /><br />Questions:<br />1.What are the health benefits of veganism?<br />2.How healthy is your diet?<br />3.What should children eat?<br />4.Do we need to eat meat and other animal products?<br />5.Should governments be making diets a criminal offence?<br />6.Where can people get proteins from besides animal products?<br />7.How well-balanced is the food people eat in your country?<br /><br />Suggested Agenda<br />7:00 p.m. --7:30 p.m. free talk <br />7:30 p.m. --8:10 p.m. first topic discussion <br />8:10 p.m. --8:20 p.m. Presentation <br />8:20 p.m.-- 8:40 p.m. Sharing time : articles &amp; other experiences. <br />8:40 p.m.-- 9.:15 p.m. second topic discussion <br />9:15 p.m.-- 9:30 p.m. Presentation<br />speaker time : 2 minutes for each speaker<br />host time : 3 minutes<br /><br />The meeting place of Thursday:<br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第一區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=13721">morris</a> — Mon Jun 03, 2019 6:33 pm</p><hr />
