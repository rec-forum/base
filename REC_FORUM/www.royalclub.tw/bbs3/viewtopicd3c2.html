				<div class="content">Session I  Crop circle<br /><br />Crop circle, large geometric pattern of flattened crops, most often found in fields in southern England. Crop circles are said by some who have studied them to be messages from intelligent extraterrestrial life, but many have been proved to be the work of humans.<br /><br />Beginning in the late 1970s, simple crop circles began to appear regularly in the fields of Wiltshire, Oxfordshire, Somerset, and Gloucestershire in southern England. They were made at night, and over the years they became more complex, growing into large patterns of geometric forms hundreds of feet across. Some people who studied crop circles were convinced that their intricacy and the fact that the plants seemed to be bent but not broken precluded a human creator, which meant that they were being produced either by some unknown natural phenomenon or by extraterrestrials.<br /><br />In 1991 Doug Bower and Dave Chorley, of Southampton, England, confessed to having made more than 200 crop circles since the late 1970s with nothing more complex than ropes and boards. They had initially been inspired by a 1966 account of a UFO sighting near Tully, Queensland, Australia, in which a flying saucer supposedly landed in a lagoon and left behind a depressed area of reeds. As crop circles became more prominent in the media, Bower and Chorley’s patterns became more complex, and they delighted in confounding the expectations of those who studied the circles.<br /><br />Questions:<br />1.Do you think crop circle was created by the alien?  Why or why not?<br />2.Have you ever seen any alien?  Will you be afraid of them if you meet an alien?  How will you communicate with it?<br />3.Are you an alien?  Please identify yourself and we will keep the secret.<br /><br />Session II Insurance<br /><br />At the dawn of modern human history, widely dispersed groups of tightly knit kin, whom we today refer to collectively as hunter - gatherers, relied almost exclusively on clan relatedness as their only bulwark against the ever - present risk of death, debilitating injury, and starvation. For these early ancestors, the concept of risk can be thought of almost exclusively in terms of the physical persons of individuals, mitigated by the guarantee of personal and kin relationships, rather than objects and possessions. <br />The later development of agrarian/pastoral societies necessitated almost everywhere the development of the notion of private property as the agricultural revolution made possible the storage of food and hence more complex societies. The efficiency gains accruing to these new social structures enabled specialization of labor into various trades, such as merchants, warriors, and blacksmiths, each requiring tools - of - trade assets. <br />The price of this progress was that individual self-interest was no longer so closely aligned with that of the collective. Ever since, individuals have recognized their need to mitigate risks that have the potential for ruin, either as a result of the assets they hold or simply by the fact of their existence in this world. In other words, a means was required for individuals to achieve at least a primitive form of financial diversification. Because risk is nonfungible at the individual level but the outcome of loss is transferable in aggregate, individuals exposed to losses through common risks naturally formed themselves into groups to aggregate those risks, price the risk, and eventually even sell it to investors. <br />Perceptions of risk and the institutional arrangements that have developed in response closely mirror philosophical advances in society ’s stance on the sanctity of the persons of individuals. Risk is commonly understood to exist and require management at the level of the individual rather than the group. The market economy is the ultimate expression of this freedom to transact, preservation of which requires the existence of regulations such as Solvency II to protect individuals ’rights. While it is apparent that Solvency II and similar regulations are implemented by national regulators acting as agents on behalf of an international body and bestowed on organizations across an industry, the ultimate goal of such regulations is to promote a socially optimal balance between the profit motive of organizations and individuals ’rights. Article 27 of the Solvency II Directive states: The main objective of (re)insurance regulation and supervision is adequate policyholder protection. Other objectives such as financial stability and fair and stable markets should also be taken into account but should not undermine that main objective. <br /><br />Questions:<br />1.What kind of insurance have you ever bought?<br />2.Do you think insurance is useful or useless?  Why?<br />3.What do you think about the insurance agent? <br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />8:10 ~ 8:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:25 ~ 8:30pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:30 ~9:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~9:30pm Concluding remarks/feedback from newcomers<br /><br />The meeting place of Thursday:<br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第一區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
