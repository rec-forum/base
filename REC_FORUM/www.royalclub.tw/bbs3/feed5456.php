This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil.<br />Sam<br />And I’m Sam.<br />Neil<br />English has many proverbs – short and well-known phrase giving a piece of useful advice, or common sense. For example, the proverb, “Actions speak louder than words” means that what people do is more important than what they say.<br />Sam<br />And the proverb, “Don’t judge a book by its cover” advises people not to form opinions about people based on how they look.<br />Neil<br />Proverbs are found in many cultures and languages, and are often passed down through the generations to teach children lessons in life. One famous English proverb is: “An apple a day keeps the doctor away”.<br />Sam<br />In other words, eating fresh fruit is good for you. But is it really true? Can eating an apple a day actually have significant health benefits? That’s the question we’ll be discussing in this programme, and as usual, we’ll be learning some new vocabulary as well.<br />Neil<br />But before that I have a question for you, Sam. Most proverbs come from a place’s history, and England has a long history of growing apples. Over the centuries, hundreds of different apple varieties have been grown in orchards up and down the country, some with quite unusual names. So, which of the following is the name of a real type of English apple? Is it:<br />a)    a Taylor’s gold?<br />b)    a Golden pippin? or<br />c)    a Black Worcester?<br />Sam<br />I don’t know but I think it’s b) a Golden pippin. <br />Neil<br />OK, Sam. I’ll reveal the answer later in the programme. But whatever the name of the apple, new scientific research is showing that there really are health benefits to eating apples, especially with the skins on. Apple skins are full of good stuff: fibre, vitamins, and especially flavonoids - a chemical compound known to reduce blood pressure and improve brain and heart health.<br />Sam<br />No wonder then, that when Dr Michael Mosley, presenter of BBC Radio 4 programme, Just One Thing, wanted a snack to eat, he reached for an apple.<br />Dr Michael Mosley<br />It's early afternoon and I'm a bit peckish, so I'm about to grab a delicious snack that could improve my blood flow, boost my brain, and trim my waistline. This is not some exotic superfood. In fact, it's an apple.<br />Neil<br />Dr Mosley wanted something to eat because he was peckish -  a little bit hungry. He wanted something healthy, but chose an apple instead of exotic superfoods like blueberries or a banana smoothie. If you call something exotic, you mean it’s unusual and exciting, often because it comes from an unfamiliar place.<br />Sam<br />Instead, he ate the least exotic fruit I can imagine - the humble apple. But Dr Mosely thinks apples do have health benefits, and he lists them: apples improve blood flow, boost the brain, and trim the waistline – a phrase which means to keep a healthy body weight with no extra fat.<br />Neil<br />Yes, one reason apples are so good for us is that the skin is packed with flavonoids which help people lose weight, and have even been linked to a longer life. But that’s not all. It’s the fact that there are so many different ways of cooking and eating apples which makes them one of the nation’s favourite foods. Here’s Dr Mosley again explaining how he likes to eat his apples to Just One Thing on BBC Sounds.<br />Dr Michael Mosley<br />What I love about apples is they are so versatile. I've been snacking on them, grating them into my porridge, and having them sliced with full fat yoghurt as a dessert. But baked apples are one of my favourite ways to consume them. It seems an apple a day really does keep the doctor away, and also keep your heart, gut and even your waistline in good shape.<br />Sam<br />Dr Mosley eats apples in porridge,  sliced with yogurt, and even baked in the oven. He describes them as versatile – things which can be used for many different purposes, or in many different ways. What’s more, cooking or baking apples doesn’t damage those healthy flavonoids, so even the occasional apple crumble with custard can be good for you!<br />Neil<br />Apple crumble and custard! I’m not so sure that’s a way to get in good shape – a phrase meaning ‘healthy’ or ‘in good condition’.<br />Sam<br />But, Neil, it seems the old proverb is true – according to the science, an apple a day really does keep the doctor away! Right, it’s time to reveal the answer to your question.<br />Neil<br />Yes, I asked you about the strange sounding names given to some varieties of English apple.<br />Sam<br />And I said that a ‘Golden pippin’ was the name of a real apple. So, was I right?<br />Neil<br />Yes you were! Golden pippin apples were first grown in Arundel, near the south coast of England, while the other two - Black Worcester and Taylor’s gold – are actually types of English pear. Right, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned from this programme, starting with proverb – a short sentence or expression giving some well-known, traditional advice.<br />Sam<br />If you’re feeling peckish, you’re slightly hungry.<br />Neil<br />The adjective exotic describes something which is unusual and exciting, often because it comes from a faraway place.<br />Sam<br />The phrase trim the waistline means to keep your body weight healthy with no extra fat around your waistline – the area of your body above the hips.<br />Neil<br />Something which is versatile can be used for many purposes, or in many different ways.<br />Sam<br />And finally, if someone is in good shape, they’re in a good state of health. Once again, our six minutes are up. Bye for now!<br /><br />Q1. Do you like to eat apples? Why or Why not?<br />Q2. As the proverb says: An apple a day keeps the doctor away. What are your thoughts on this statement? Can eating an apple a day actually have significant health benefits?<br />Q3.How often do you eat fruit? What are your favorites? What are the health benefits of your fruits?<br />Q4. If you were peckish and wanted something healthy, what snacks would you choose?<br /><br />Session II:<br />Taiwan must make hiking safer<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2023/03/05/2003795498">https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editor ... 2003795498</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Three fatal hiking incidents were among seven that required search-and-rescue operations during the 228 Memorial Day long weekend.<br />Nenggao Cross-Ridge Historic Trail (能高越嶺古道), where one of the fatal incidents occurred, is one of Taiwan’s top 15 hiking routes for which permits are required. During the long weekend, a hiker fell down a cliff and died, only six days after a similar fatal incident on the trail.<br />The government in October 2019 eased requirements and application procedures for 81 trails. When COVID-19 curbs were imposed a year later, many people flocked to the nation’s hiking trails.<br />Data from the National Fire Agency showed that the number of search-and-rescue missions after hiking incidents increased from 231 in 2019 to 608 in 2020, the highest in a decade. Even though trails were closed for two months during the pandemic, the agency counted 528 missions in 2021 and 566 last year.<br />From 2015 to 2021, the most common reasons for emergency calls were people “having gotten lost or reported missing” (43 percent), followed by “injuries” (20 percent), “illnesses and altitude sickness” (15 percent) and “falling off cliffs” (11 percent).<br />The vast majority of incidents were reported by self-organized hiking groups, accounting for 75.6 percent in 2020 and 68 percent in 2021, followed by solo hikers, accounting for 18 percent in 2020 and 12 percent in 2021.<br />National Airborne Service Corps data showed that it deployed helicopters for search-and-rescue operations 78 times in 2019. That number rose to 166 flights in 2020, 190 in 2021 and 170 last year.<br />The National Development Council in November last year announced a five-year project to increase the efficiency of mountain rescue operations. The project is to run from next year to 2028 and have a budget of NT$740 million (US$24.2 million), including for rescue equipment upgrades and boosting rescue training.<br />Several public hearings have been held in the past two years to better prevent hiking accidents. Mountain rescue professionals, hiking guides and experienced hikers expressed their concerns and made suggestions. Many of them said that unexperienced hikers might attempt difficult ascents, such as the most famous 100 peaks among Taiwan’s 268 mountains higher than 3,000m, after seeing pictures on social media, without being properly equipped or knowing the risks. Others might underestimate seemingly easier one-day hikes or be caught off guard by rapidly changing weather, while lacking essential equipment and enough water and food. They might overestimate their stamina and skills, and make unwise decisions.<br />Many prospective hikers seek out hiking partners or groups online. Such groups, consisting of members that do not know each other well, might not react appropriately and in a coordinated manner when facing emergency situations.<br />Tour guides leading commercial hiking groups vary greatly in terms of skill and qualifications, as there is no authority that oversees the sector. There is no regulation regarding the guide-to-hiker ratio, and while the Sports Administration issues certificates for hiking guides, no formal qualification is required to organize commercial hiking trips.<br />Hikers have the responsibility to be prepared when hitting the trails, but the government must also do its part. It should not only boost search-and-rescue capabilities, but create a unified difficulty rating system for trails, work with private-sector entities to provide safety information and regulate hiking companies. It should also determine which government agency is responsible. That could be the Sports Administration, the Forestry Bureau, the Tourism Bureau or the Ministry of the Interior.<br /><br />Q1. Do you like to go hiking? Why or Why not?<br />Q2. What are your favorite hiking routes and your memorable experiences?<br />Q3. Why are so many more fatal accidents lately on the trail in Taiwan?<br />Q4. How can hiking be made safer? What should hikers be prepared for when hitting the trails?<br /><br />P.S.<br />1.參加三次(含實體及線上會議)後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />2.請帶著開放的心與熱情來參加全英文會話聚會!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=89">AndrewWang</a> — Sat Mar 11, 2023 5:10 pm</p><hr />
