The vaccine coverage rate was 21.7%, while the severity of the lockdown dropped from 71% to 56%.<br />Flight capacity shrank by 87.2%, leading Taiwan to be ranked 41st out of 53 economies in the world, lagging countries such as Nigeria, Egypt, Peru, and Mexico.<br />Other neighboring countries in Asia included Singapore ranked 8th, while Hong Kong placed 18th.<br />China secured a spot at 24, while South Korea ranked 26th.<br />The list also saw Japan at 33, Thailand at 49, Vietnam at 50, Indonesia at 51, and the Philippines and Malaysia at 52 and 53 respectively.<br />After the outbreak of a local epidemic in May this year, Taiwan dropped from the 5th to 15th place in the world.<br />In the ranking released on June 28, Taiwan ranked 44th among 53 major economies, moving up 4 places to 40th in July, and dropped another place to 41st in August.<br />Bloomberg has released the Global Resilience Rankings since 2020 and publishes the latest results at the end of each month.<br />The rankings are based on the past month’s “vaccine coverage,” “lockdown severity,” “Flight Capacity” and “Vaccinated Travel Routes” for 53 countries with economies over $200 billion in size.<br />Since the vaccination population is still low and flights have been reduced, Taiwan landed near the bottom of the ranking.<br /><br />Q1.What are your thoughts on the “Covid Resilience Ranking” compiled by Bloomberg?<br />Q2. What do you think about Taiwan landing near the bottom of the ranking?<br />Q3. The rankings are based on “vaccine coverage,” “lockdown severity,” “Flight Capacity” and “Vaccinated Travel Routes”; which items should be added and why?<br />Q4. Do you have any opinions on our government's efforts?<br /><br />Session II:<br />Four ways to get better at languages<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/34016">https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/34016</a><!-- m --><br />•	Sometimes, when we're learning a language, we can feel very frustrated.<br />•	Despite all the hours that we're putting in and all of the hard work that we're doing,<br />•	when it comes to actually speaking the language, it can sometimes come out stuttered, full of mistakes, and sound like we're not really that good.<br />•	This can lead to a lot of self-doubt.<br />•	It can lead us to ask questions like, 'Can I really learn this language?' or 'Have I perhaps reached my limit?'<br />•	The way to start speaking a language more fluently and more proficiently is just to practise <br />speaking it.<br />•	Practise, practise and practise again.<br />•	Here are some tips that you can use to get more practice at speaking the language.<br />•	So, the first one is: get a conversation partner.<br />•	You can find a lot of people who will be happy to practise languages with you online.<br />•	Or, otherwise, if you go to a meetup group or a student event, I'm sure you will find plenty of people who you can practise your languages with.<br />•	If you don't know where to find a conversation partner, the other thing you could do is start to talk to yourself, or, if you're not comfortable talking to yourself in public, just think to yourself.<br />•	Start narrating to yourself what you're doing and working out what things you're comfortable <br />describing and what things you're not yet comfortable talking about.<br />•	Then, when you go home, you'll be able to fill in those vocabulary gaps, and the next day try again.<br />•	The third thing you can do is to learn vocabulary like you want to use it.<br />•	So, instead of just learning the word for 'door', why not learn it in a phrase like 'open the door', 'close the door' or 'behind the door'.<br />•	That means that when you need to talk about things like that, you're immediately gonna have <br />phrases that you can start using.<br />•	Finally, whenever you learn a new grammar point or anything really in the language, always think <br />about how you could use this.<br />•	Imagine a scenario in which you'd use it naturally, with friends, as part of your normal life,<br />•	and then immediately you'll find that what you're learning theoretically will be much more <br />applicable to your speaking of the language.<br />•	Share your language-learning tips and experiences by leaving a comment below, and make sure <br />you check out the other videos in this series.<br /><br />Q1. What do you do when you feel very frustrated in learning a language?<br />Q2.Which tips in this article have you tried before or can you use to get more practice at speaking the language?<br />Q3. Do you have any language-learning tips or experiences of you own?<br />Q4. Have you ever reached your limit in English? How did you solve it?<br />P.S.<br />1.因疫情關係，聚會方式改為線上遠距。<br />2.參加三次後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />3.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會</div>
