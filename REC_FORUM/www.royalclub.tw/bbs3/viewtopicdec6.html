What do you think about multiple assaults against store clerks over mask-wearing?<br />Q2. How can our society have become so violent?<br />Q3. Do you know what the government does to those who endanger public safety? Will they take any action after the tragic incident?<br />Q4. While convenience store clerks contribute to epidemic prevention, how can they protect their personal safety?<br />Q5. What will you do about people who don’t wear a mask in public?<br /><br />P.S.<br />1.參加三次後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />2.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~</div>
