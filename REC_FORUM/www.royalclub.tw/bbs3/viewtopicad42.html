Lessons from the longest study on happiness </span><br /><br />Robert Waldinger<br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KkKuTCFvzI" class="postlink">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KkKuTCFvzI</a><br /><br />What keeps us happy and healthy as we go through life? If you think it's fame and money, you're not alone – but, according to psychiatrist Robert Waldinger, you're mistaken. As the director of a 75-year-old study on adult development, Waldinger has unprecedented access to data on true happiness and satisfaction. In this talk, he shares three important lessons learned from the study as well as some practical, old-as-the-hills wisdom on how to build a fulfilling, long life. <br /><br />What keeps us healthy and happy as we go through life? If you were going to invest now in your future best self, where would you put your time and your energy? There was a recent survey of millennials asking them what their most important life goals were, and over 80 percent said that a major life goal for them was to get rich. And another 50 percent of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous. <br /><br />And we're constantly told to lean in to work, to push harder and achieve more. We're given the impression that these are the things that we need to go after in order to have a good life. Pictures of entire lives, of the choices that people make and how those choices work out for them, those pictures are almost impossible to get. Most of what we know about human life we know from asking people to remember the past, and as we know, hindsight is anything but 20/20. We forget vast amounts of what happens to us in life, and sometimes memory is downright creative. <br /><br />But what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time? What if we could study people from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keeps people happy and healthy? <br /><br />We did that. The Harvard Study of Adult Development may be the longest study of adult life that's ever been done. For 75 years, we've tracked the lives of 724 men, year after year, asking about their work, their home lives, their health, and of course asking all along the way without knowing how their life stories were going to turn out. <br /><br />Studies like this are exceedingly rare. Almost all projects of this kind fall apart within a decade because too many people drop out of the study, or funding for the research dries up, or the researchers get distracted, or they die, and nobody moves the ball further down the field. But through a combination of luck and the persistence of several generations of researchers, this study has survived. About 60 of our original 724 men are still alive, still participating in the study, most of them in their 90s. And we are now beginning to study the more than 2,000 children of these men. And I'm the fourth director of the study. <br /><br />Since 1938, we've tracked the lives of two groups of men. The first group started in the study when they were sophomores at Harvard College. They all finished college during World War II, and then most went off to serve in the war. And the second group that we've followed was a group of boys from Boston's poorest neighborhoods, boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the Boston of the 1930s. Most lived in tenements, many without hot and cold running water. <br /><br />When they entered the study, all of these teenagers were interviewed. They were given medical exams. We went to their homes and we interviewed their parents. And then these teenagers grew up into adults who entered all walks of life. They became factory workers and lawyers and bricklayers and doctors, one President of the United States. Some developed alcoholism. A few developed schizophrenia. Some climbed the social ladder from the bottom all the way to the very top, and some made that journey in the opposite direction. <br /><br />The founders of this study would never in their wildest dreams have imagined that I would be standing here today, 75 years later, telling you that the study still continues. Every two years, our patient and dedicated research staff calls up our men and asks them if we can send them yet one more set of questions about their lives. <br />Many of the inner city Boston men ask us, &quot;Why do you keep wanting to study me? My life just isn't that interesting.&quot; The Harvard men never ask that question. <br /><br />To get the clearest picture of these lives, we don't just send them questionnaires. We interview them in their living rooms. We get their medical records from their doctors. We draw their blood, we scan their brains, we talk to their children. We videotape them talking with their wives about their deepest concerns. And when, about a decade ago, we finally asked the wives if they would join us as members of the study, many of the women said, &quot;You know, it's about time.&quot; <br /><br />So what have we learned? What are the lessons that come from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we've generated on these lives? Well, the lessons aren't about wealth or fame or working harder and harder. The clearest message that we get from this 75-year study is this: Good relationships keep us happier and healthier. Period. <br /><br />We've learned three big lessons about relationships. The first is that social connections are really good for us, and that loneliness kills. It turns out that people who are more socially connected to family, to friends, to community, are happier, they're physically healthier, and they live longer than people who are less well connected. And the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic. People who are more isolated than they want to be from others find that they are less happy, their health declines earlier in midlife, their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely. And the sad fact is that at any given time, more than one in five Americans will report that they're lonely. <br /><br />And we know that you can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage, so the second big lesson that we learned is that it's not just the number of friends you have, and it's not whether or not you're in a committed relationship, but it's the quality of your close relationships that matters. It turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health. High-conflict marriages, for example, without much affection, turn out to be very bad for our health, perhaps worse than getting divorced. And living in the midst of good, warm relationships is protective. <br /><br />Once we had followed our men all the way into their 80s, we wanted to look back at them at midlife and to see if we could predict who was going to grow into a happy, healthy octogenarian and who wasn't. And when we gathered together everything we knew about them at age 50, it wasn't their middle age cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old. It was how satisfied they were in their relationships. The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80. And good, close relationships seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows of getting old. Our most happily partnered men and women reported, in their 80s, that on the days when they had more physical pain, their mood stayed just as happy. But the people who were in unhappy relationships, on the days when they reported more physical pain, it was magnified by more emotional pain. <br /><br />And the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health is that good relationships don't just protect our bodies, they protect our brains. It turns out that being in a securely attached relationship to another person in your 80s is protective, that the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need, those people's memories stay sharper longer. And the people in relationships where they feel they really can't count on the other one, those are the people who experience earlier memory decline. And those good relationships, they don't have to be smooth all the time. Some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out, but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough, those arguments didn't take a toll on their memories. <br /><br />So this message, that good, close relationships are good for our health and well-being, this is wisdom that's as old as the hills. Why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore? Well, we're human. What we'd really like is a quick fix, something we can get that'll make our lives good and keep them that way. Relationships are messy and they're complicated and the hard work of tending to family and friends, it's not sexy or glamorous. It's also lifelong. It never ends. The people in our 75-year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates. Just like the millennials in that recent survey, many of our men when they were starting out as young adults really believed that fame and wealth and high achievement were what they needed to go after to have a good life. But over and over, over these 75 years, our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned in to relationships, with family, with friends, with community. <br /><br />So what about you? Let's say you're 25, or you're 40, or you're 60. What might leaning in to relationships even look like? <br />Well, the possibilities are practically endless. It might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together, long walks or date nights, or reaching out to that family member who you haven't spoken to in years, because those all-too-common family feuds take a terrible toll on the people who hold the grudges. <br /><br />I'd like to close with a quote from Mark Twain. More than a century ago, he was looking back on his life, and he wrote this: &quot;There isn't time, so brief is life, for bickerings, apologies, heart burnings, callings to account. There is only time for loving, and but an instant, so to speak, for that.&quot; <br /><br />The good life is built with good relationships. <br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions: </span><br />1.

Health Department officials withheld specifics of the death somewhere in New York City or the surrounding suburbs, citing privacy concerns.<br /><br />&quot;Influenza is a significant threat to public health, and we are strongly encouraging anyone who has not already gotten the flu vaccine to get one immediately,&quot; said Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker.<br /><br />More than 11,280 cases of influenza have been confirmed by laboratory across New York state since the season started five weeks ago. Additionally, at least 3,600 people have been hospitalized with flu as the virus' rapid spread strained hospitals and emergency departments.<br /><br />For example, NewYork-Presbyterian Medical Groups across Westchester County, as well as Queens and Brooklyn, has seen a spike in cases compared to last year. Since the start of the flu season in August 2017, the group has seen 347 flu cases, up 51 percent compared to the 230 cases during the same period last year.<br /><br />&quot;This flu seas seems to be more severe than the past six or seven years,&quot; said Dr. Sean Cloonan, infectious disease specialist with NewYork-Presbyterian Medical Group Westchester, referring to unofficial data trickling in from across the country.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">NATIONAL: Deaths and hospitalizations rise as flu season hits full swing</span><br /><br />&quot;The hospital admissions are up (at NewYork-Presbyterian) and a lot of patients in house, and so far we’ve been able to keep up but there is definitely a big spike in the volume,&quot; Cloonan said.<br /><br />Cloonan and Zucker both urged people to get the flu vaccine. They citied the fact the virus is expected to keep spreading in the coming weeks and the flu shot offers a range of protections.<br /><br />Rockland and Westchester hospitals are confident that patient care will not be negatively impacted amid a severe flu season because of a national shortage of IV bags due to hurricane related storm damage to the manufacturing plants. <br /><br />&quot;Getting vaccinated is not just about protecting yourself, it also protects people around you, including those who are more vulnerable, like babies and young children, older people, and people with certain chronic health conditions,&quot; Zucker said.<br /><br />During last year's flu season, there were 12,912 flu-related hospitalizations and eight pediatric deaths in New York, health department officials said. Over the last four years, there have been a total of 25 pediatric flu deaths statewide and an average of 10,571 flu-related hospitalizations per year.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Public-health officials offered other safety tips In addition to getting a flu shot:</span><br /><br />•Wash your hands often with soap and hot water for at least 20 seconds to protect <br />yourself from germs and avoid spreading them to others.<br />•Carry an alcohol-based hand sanitizer to use when soap and water are not <br />available. Choose a product with at least 60% alcohol.<br />•Do not cough or sneeze into your hands. Instead, cover your mouth and nose with <br />a tissue.<br />•Wear a mask to prevent spreading the virus.<br /><br />For more information about the flu, visit the health department's website.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">National outbreak</span><br /><br />With flu season now in full swing — causing widespread illness in 46 states — health officials across the country are reporting waves of misery, rising hospitalizations and some deaths, USA TODAY reported.<br /><br />It is still too soon to say just how bad this flu season will be, but there are troubling signs in some places.<br />For example, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in an update posted recently, said 13 children nationwide had died of flu so far this season. About 100 children have died in each of the past several flu seasons. <br /><br />The season got off to an early start and the number of states reporting widespread activity jumped from 36 to 46 in the last week of December, CDC said. <br /><br />The overall impact can vary greatly year to year, but flu always takes a substantial toll. CDC estimates that influenza has caused 9 million to 35 million illnesses, 140,000 to 710,000 hospitalizations and 12,000 to 56,000 deaths in the United States each year since 2010.<br /><br />In many cases, hospitalizations and deaths do not show up in official reports, for a variety of reasons — including the fact that most people with flu are never tested for it and that states are not required to report adult flu deaths.<br /><br />One reason this could be a bad season: A majority of patients tested so far carried a type of influenza virus, called H3N2, that is linked to increased hospitalizations and deaths in young children and people over age 65, according to CDC. Vaccines often are less effective against these viruses than other flu viruses.<br /><br />Still, CDC officials and other experts continue to say vaccination is the best bet, and not too late.<br />“We don’t know when it’s going to end, but we anticipate at least several more weeks of flu activity,” said Christy Sadreameli, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore.<br /><br />Cloonan, of NewYork-Presbyterian, expanded on the benefits of getting the flu vaccine and attempted to dispel any misconceptions.<br /><br />&quot;Many times the people do get the flu even if they’ve been vaccinated, but it’s important that people understand that even if you get the flu and you got the flu vaccine you got a less of a severe flu,&quot; he said.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />1. What are the symptoms of the flu? <br />2. Do you get flu vaccine during flu season or not? What's your opinion on the safety or benefits of the flu vaccine?<br />3. What should you do to protect yourself from the flu this season? In this article, public health officials offer other safety tips in addition to getting a flu shot. Do you agree with those tips or not?<br />4. When should you get vaccinated? Where can one get a flu shot?
