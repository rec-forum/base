The blanket ban was imposed in 2011 after the Fukushima nuclear disaster. On Tuesday, the Executive Yuan announced that imports from five affected Japanese prefectures will be allowed, as early as the end of this month. All food imports will have to carry proof of radioactive testing and proof of origin to enter Taiwan. <br /><br />Lo Ping-cheng<br />Executive Yuan spokesperson<br />We have decided to make some reasonable adjustments to the policies on Japanese food that have been in place for 11 years. Today’s press conference is to report on this matter to the public.<br /><br />Seated in a row of officials, Executive Yuan spokesperson Lo Ping-cheng made the announcement. Hailing a “return to science” and pledging rigorous import checks, he said Taiwan was ending its blanket ban on food imports from five Japanese prefectures, including Fukushima.<br /><br />Sheu Fuu<br />Office of Food Safety<br />Back in 2008, Taiwan set safety standards for permitted levels of atomic dust and radioactive contamination in food. After the Fukushima nuclear disaster, we amended the standards on two occasions, in 2013 and 2016. Right now, they are the strictest standards in the world. Take cesium-134 and cesium-137 as an example. Codex sets the limit for these two substances at 1,000 becquerels per kilogram of food. Canada, the EU and the U.S. all allow for more than 1,000 becquerels per kilogram. In Taiwan, the maximum permitted is 100 becquerels per kilogram. That’s 10 times stricter than the international standard.<br /><br />The official stressed that Taiwan would not allow the import of radioactive food. Another said that the government would launch three complementary measures alongside strict testing protocols.<br /><br />Wu Shou-mei<br />Food and Drug Administration<br />Instead of banning imports from certain areas, we will only ban certain high-risk products. All products that have been banned from circulation in Japan will not be allowed to be imported to Taiwan. Products such as wild animal meat, mushrooms, and koshiabura will not be allowed in. Food products from Fukushima and the other four prefectures will be required to provide two documents upon entering Taiwan: proof of radioactive testing and proof of origin. Every single food product shipment from the five prefectures that reaches Taiwan’s borders will be inspected. <br /><br />Chen Shih-chung<br />Health minister<br />We will have more restrictions on the types of food products, double documentation checks and inspections on every shipment that arrives in Taiwan. There will also be stricter spot checks for nine main kinds of food products. In general, products that are cleared for distribution in Japan have been tested for safety. So that’s an assurance. <br /><br />The new regulations could enter effect as early as the end of February. Minister without Portfolio John Deng says the lifting of the blanket ban could help Taiwan’s bid to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. He said it could pave the way for greater engagement with the international community.<br /><br /><br />Q1. Do you like Japanese food products? If yes, what is your favorite food product? If not, why not?<br />Q2. Do you agree with the lifting of the ban on Japanese food imports from Fukushima ? Why or why not?<br />Q3. Is it the right time to end the Fukushima food ban? Why? If not, when is the proper time?<br />Q4. Food products from Fukushima and the other four neighboring prefectures will be required to provide two documents upon entering Taiwan: proof of radioactive testing and proof of origin. Every single food product shipment from the five prefectures that reaches Taiwan’s borders will be inspected. Do you think it is safe? If it is safe, will you try them? If not, how can you protect yourself?<br />Q5. Do you think the lifting of the blanket ban could help Taiwan’s bid to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership?<br />1.參加三次後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />2.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=89">AndrewWang</a> — Wed Feb 16, 2022 9:39 pm</p><hr />
