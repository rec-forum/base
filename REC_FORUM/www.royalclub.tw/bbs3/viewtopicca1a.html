			<div class="content">3/16(Sat.)CES 2019: Can breath-sniffing gadgets improve your diet?/Vodafone: Huawei ban will set back 5G (Host: Danny Lin)<br /><br /><br />Article I: CES 2019: Can breath-sniffing gadgets improve your diet?<br />Link: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-46804788">https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-46804788</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br />Two gadgets that analyse the gases in people's breath in an effort to reveal how they should improve their diet are being showcased at the CES tech show in Las Vegas.<br />Lumen and FoodMarble are both pocket-sized devices that users blow into.<br />They pair smartphone apps that tell people things like how well they are digesting food or burning calories.<br />But one expert said such technology has yet to be properly validated by scientists.<br />Lumen has raised almost $2m (£1.57m) on the crowdfunding site Indiegogo. It has designed an inhaler-shaped product that measures carbon dioxide levels in the user's breath.<br />The firm says this provides a way of monitoring a person's metabolism - the chemical processes that, among other things, convert food into energy.<br />&quot;You don't need to guess how much sugar was in that kung pao chicken or how many calories you did on that run,&quot; explained founder Dror Cedar.<br />Instead, he told the BBC, the app simply explains whether the user is burning carbs or fat. It then suggests recipes that help burn fat and, over time, Lumen learns what diet is most appropriate for each user.<br />Lumen has been trialled by &quot;hundreds&quot; of users in the US, according to Mr Cedar.<br />However, studies measuring the effectiveness of the product have not yet been peer-reviewed.<br />It will go on sale for $299 (£235) this summer, though people who pre-order will pay $250. The app might charge a subscription fee in the future, but it will be free for everyone during its first year.<br /><br />Conversely, FoodMarble measures hydrogen levels in an attempt to make deductions about a person's digestive health. It was released in December. The firm has racked up nearly $1 million in pre-ordered devices, which have now been shipped.<br />Founder Lisa Ruttledge told the BBC that hydrogen in the breath can be a sign that someone is having trouble digesting a recent meal.<br />&quot;That's happening because there's fermentation happening in your gut and some hydrogen created in that process is exhaled,&quot; she said.<br />The idea is to help people who experience bloating, abdominal pain and other gastrointestinal symptoms. Through revealing foods that result in hydrogen production, FoodMarble could help them tailor healthier diets.<br />However, although such tests are sometimes used by doctors and dieticians, some question whether they are accurate.<br />&quot;There is only limited scientific research showing that these validated tests carried out in a hospital environment can tell you what foods you are sensitive to,&quot; said Kevin Whelan, a professor of diatetics at King's College London.<br />This is because various factors can influence breath results - including the time taken for a meal to be digested, which is not always the same.<br />&quot;Portable, user-driven machines that test breath gas have never been used in scientific studies to show what foods people may be sensitive to,&quot; he added.<br />Ruttledge said that one of her firm's goals was to have FoodMarble become the first such device to be evaluated in a scientific study.<br /><br /> Discussion<br />1. Does this magical device appeal to you? Why? Why not?<br />2. The stomach is the most important organ of the human body. Have you ever had related diseases? Can you share your story? Do you think it is a food problem or something else? If not, please answer the next question?<br />3. Please share your health tips. (How to prevent stomach problems)<br /><br /><br />Article II : Vodafone: Huawei ban will set back 5G<br />Link: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47482140">https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47482140</a><!-- m --><br /><br />For some time, mobile operators have been briefing reporters in private that a complete ban on using Huawei equipment would be seriously damaging to the UK's 5G future.<br />But on Thursday morning, Vodafone came out with a stark warning in public: stop us from using Huawei gear and 5G will be delayed, at huge cost to us and the UK.<br />The government's Supply Chain Review is currently examining whether the controversial Chinese company should play a part in the rollout of super-fast 5G, amid security concerns and US pressure for a complete ban.<br />But Vodafone's chief technology officer, Scott Petty, has now said a ban would require his company to strip Huawei equipment out of its existing 4G network.<br />&quot;The cost of doing that runs into the hundreds of millions and will dramatically affect our 5G business case,&quot; he said.<br />&quot;We would have to slow down the deployment of 5G very significantly.&quot;<br /><br />What are countries worried about?<br />There are fears that China is using Huawei as a proxy so it can spy on rival nations and scoop up useful information.<br />And its products are regularly subjected to security testing by the UK's GCHQ intelligence agency.<br />Huawei, however, is keen to portray itself as a private company owned by its employees, with no ties to the Chinese government beyond those of a law-abiding taxpayer.<br />But critics question how free any major Chinese business can be from Beijing's influence.<br />And they point out Huawei's media-shy founder, Ren Zhengfei, was a former engineer in the country's army and joined the Communist Party in 1978.<br />What's going on with Huawei?<br />Mr Petty said the UK was a leader in 5G readiness and would fall behind if Huawei was banned.<br />He stressed that Huawei equipment was not being used in sensitive parts of the 5G network, which Vodafone plans to start rolling out later this year.<br />And its policy had been framed by advice from the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).<br />Vodafone's general counsel, Helen Lamprell, said there was no evidence that Huawei's equipment posed a security threat.<br />&quot;Huge impact to the government's ambition to be a leader in 5G, huge cost to the industry... for what?&quot; she asked.<br />&quot;If there's evidence, we would love to see it - but so far we haven't seen any evidence.&quot;<br />Vodafone is using the US firm Cisco at the core of its 5G network, the most sensitive area, and equipment from Sweden's Ericsson elsewhere.<br />Huawei's equipment is just being used at the radio masts, which Vodafone says is a very low risk area: hacking any individual mast would not allow access to the wider network.<br />Vodafone also joined calls for all telecoms equipment-makers to undergo the same kind of scrutiny as Huawei.<br />&quot;Huawei are subject to a lot of scrutiny which we think is great,&quot; Ms Lamprell said. &quot;But they're not the only vendor and the same engineering issues apply everywhere.&quot;<br />Roaming charges<br />Ms Lamprell also refused to rule out the return of roaming charges in the event of the UK leaving the European Union without a withdrawal agreement in place.<br />Vodafone would far prefer to maintain the status quo for travellers, she said, but could not be sure what European mobile companies would charge after Brexit to handle calls from UK travellers.<br />&quot;What we have to face is: are we going to get a massive bill coming back in the other direction that we can't absorb?&quot; Ms Lamprell said.<br />Vodafone also revealed that all the mobile operators wanted the limit on phone-mast height increased from 25m (82ft) to 50m.<br />The mobile operators are under pressure from the government to improve coverage in remote rural areas.<br /><br /><br /><br />Discussion<br />1. Information security and cheap internet, which one do you value?<br />2. Why? Why not another one?<br />3. Are you afraid of the Chinese-made equipment stealing your information?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:25pm discussion session <br />8:25 ~ 8:30pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:30 ~9:30pm discussion session<br />(Session III)<br />9:30 pm Free talk<br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
