			<div class="content">4/18(Sat.) NTH Room: South Korea’s New Scandal &amp; Five ways to strengthen your relationship (Host:Shuman)<br /><br />NTH Room: South Korea’s New Scandal<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.koreaboo.com/news/victim-telegram-nth-room-case-speaks-horrors-faced-middle-school-student/">https://www.koreaboo.com/news/victim-te ... l-student/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The Telegram Nth Room case has taken South Korea by storm, with Cho Joo Bin revealed as one of the main perpetrators. The specific details on what the girls were involved in the case are gruesome, and should not be read by those who may feel uncomfortable.<br /><br />One of the victims, who was a minor at the time of her involvement in the case, spoke up on CBS radio show Kim Hyun Jung‘s News Show earlier today. She shared her entire story in a 13 minute long interview, from how she was tricked to what she wishes on Cho Joo Bin. Here is the entire interview.<br /><br />Kim Hyun Jung: The interview I am about to conduct is about the Nth Room case, with a victim of the case. I introduced the case yesterday but in short, the operators would entice women to work part-time for them, gather their personal information, and get them to take naked videos of themselves. Then they would threaten the women to film cruel and bizarre videos. There were videos that went beyond nudity, and moved towards self-inflicted harm on their own bodies. There were videos of others purposely being sent to rape the women. There were so many bizarre things, we can’t even mention them on the show.<br /><br />Kim Hyun Jung: The room where these videos were uploaded was called the Doctor’s room, and the operator was known as Baksa (Doctor). Members who entered the room were required to pay at least ₩250,000 KRW ($199.07 USD) and up to ₩1,550,000 million KRW ($1,234.20 USD) to watch the videos. There have been 74 victims identified by police so far, but they have yet to tell their stories to the public. But the woman I am about to interview has decided to tell the world her story. She decided to do the interview because she thought she should come forward and make it public. This ordeal happened to her when she was a minor, back in 2018. Let’s meet her now. Please understand that her voice is being modified. Are you ready?<br />Questions:<br />1.Have you ever hear the people be sneaked photos?<br />2.How can we get rid of the threaten? <br />3. What is wrong on the society? (according to the article, the members on the group are up to 260,000 people.)<br /><br /><br />Five ways to strengthen your relationship <br /><br />■ Be appreciative, daily<br />Sarah Calvert, a relationship therapist in London, says: “Starting from a place of appreciation is always of benefit, and can help solve more difficult conversations. It’s easy to focus on what is lacking, so I invite people to think about what they appreciate about the other person on a daily basis. Find one thing each day and tell them.” This could be anything from something they do, or a quality that they have to the way they are looking. “Actively seeking out things to appreciate helps them feel valued,” says Calvert, and when your partner better understands what you appreciate about them, they’ll probably start doing those things a bit more.<br /><br />■ Don’t try to change your partner<br />“This is the person you have chosen, and they are who they are. You can’t change somebody else,” says Dee Holmes, a senior practice consultant for Relate. This can even come down to not sweating the small stuff. “We all do things that irritate our partners,” says Holmes. “Does this really need addressing or should you accept that’s just what they do?” Respect and celebrate each other’s individuality. While couple time is important, says Holmes, “you’ve got to allow someone that space to still see their friends and do their own things.” After all, if you stopped them from pursuing their interests and doing all those things that makes them them, she warns, “they’re not going to be the person you got together with.”<br /><br />■ Avoid assumptions<br /><br />“It can be quite easy to not say the obvious things, because you assume the other person knows,” says Holmes. It can be just as easy to erroneously assume you understand them. If your partner says they don’t want to go out tonight after all, says Holmes, you might feel cheated by their backtracking, without considering what caused their change of heart. Perhaps something is troubling them. Try some active listening, suggests Calvert. “Make an effort to be fully present, and really learn what is going on for that person, rather than just hearing the words.”<br /><br />■ Brush up on your communication skills<br />This starts with being in touch with your own feelings, says Calvert. “Otherwise, you won’t be able to say what you need and what you want. Good communication fosters emotional intimacy, which can lead to greater feelings of fulfillment, understanding, trust and safety.” She suggests being more mindful of the language and the tone you use. “Often people say things [to their partner] that sound really harsh, not in a way in which they would address anyone else,” she says. When responding defensively, they often don’t even say what they really mean. She suggests asking yourself: “If you were listening to this conversation, how would it make you feel?”<br /><br />■ Discover what makes your partner feel loved<br />“Some people feel loved through their partner’s actions, anything from bringing a cup of tea for them in bed to upgrading their technology,” says Calvert. Some need affirming words, to be told that they’re loved. For others, physical contact is more significant: intimacy, sex, holding hands. Maybe it’s quality time, with your full attention, or perhaps gifts hold greater meaning for your partner.<br /><br />(The Guardian)<br />Questions<br />1. What tips are given in this article to improve a relationship?<br />2. Could these tips also be used to improve your relationships with friends and family?<br />3. We often say harsh things to the people who love us the most. Why do you think that is? What could be done to avoid it, according to the article?<br />4.
