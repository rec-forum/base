			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Session I</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Chinese Versus Western Superstitions</span><br /><br /><a href="http://laowaiblog.com/chinese-superstitions/" class="postlink">http://laowaiblog.com/chinese-superstitions/</a><br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic"><span style="font-weight: bold">Chinese Superstitions are very different from Western ones. Dr. Caryn Voskuil explains how these differences reflect in the culture<br /></span></span><br />I arrived in Beijing during the spring festival this year. The taxi dropped me off at my apartment, and though it wasn’t even dark yet, I decided to lie down and rest. As soon as the sun set, however, explosives began to go off all over the city. Just outside my window, firecrackers, bottle rockets and various other noisemakers were detonated for hours on end, night after night. The noise was unlike anything I’d ever heard before, both in volume and in duration! My dog and I were at first surprised, then shocked, and finally just plain miserable. My Chinese friends informed me that the purpose of the rockets (and the noise) was to ward off bad spirits and welcome in a prosperous New Year. Likewise, fireworks are set off during weddings and other celebrations in China to chase away any angry spirits that might try to ‘crash’ the party like a drunken neighbor from the world beyond. Hmmmmm…Was this the legendary Chinese ‘Superstitiousness’ I’d heard so much about? Like those of us in the West, the Chinese have a variety of beliefs, and many of such Chinese Superstitions are a mystery to newcomers here in the East.<br /><br />In the American Heritage Dictionary, a superstition is defined as “A belief, practice, or rite irrationally maintained by ignorance of the laws of nature or by faith in magic or chance.” Princeton’s WordNet defines a superstition as “an irrational belief arising from ignorance or fear.” From these definitions we can clearly see that Westerners are not impervious to superstition. For instance, most Westerners share a distaste for the number thirteen. The number thirteen is associated with bad luck, and although there is no rational reason to make this association, scores of people in the west avoid getting married on the 13th day of the month or living in places that are numbered ‘13’. They expect dark clouds to follow them on Friday the 13th, and many hotels do not even have a 13th floor! (that is, they do not NUMBER the 13th floor as such).<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Chinese Superstitions VS Western Superstitions</span><br /><br />In the west, walking under a ladder, stepping on a crack, and letting a black cat cross one’s path are all seen (irrationally) as unlucky, and individuals have their own unique superstitions as well. Some athletes wear the same socks or jersey repeatedly to ensure a continued winning streak. Many otherwise rational people have a lucky pen, tie, or other such surrogate ‘rabbit’s foot’ without which they feel exposed to the ravages of fate.<br /><br />Brides wear white, mourners wear black, and loved ones tie yellow ribbons around trees to bring their friends and family members back into the fold. In the west if you knock on wood, throw salt over your shoulder, or make a wish and blow out the candles, you will likely feel that you have averted disaster or compelled the future, to some small degree, to yield to your will.<br /><br />In the land of ‘wedding rockets’ and explosive New Year’s celebrations, superstitions are also abound, but they take on a different and distinctly eastern cultural tone. For example, while the number thirteen holds no ill associations, the number four is universally spurned in China because the character ‘四’ (four) is a homonym for the character ‘死’ which means ‘death’. For this reason, many Chinese do not want an address that includes the number ‘4’, they avoid celebrating events on or making important plans during dates that contain the number ‘4’, and they eschew cell phone numbers, license plates, and other personal items that contain the number ‘4’. The number eight, by contrast, is considered a very lucky number, because the Chinese word for ‘8’ is a homonym for ‘prosperity’. This is one of the reasons that the Olympic Games were scheduled to start on August 8th – or 8/8/2008. The numbers 9 is also considered lucky – you will notice in China that ancient Chinese gates (such as those found in the Forbidden City) have 81 studs on them (or, 9×9).<br /><br />In direct opposition to western superstitious beliefs, the color white in China is associated with mourning and is therefore considered unlucky, while weddings have traditionally been associated with the color red (although today this is changing). Red is generally considered an auspicious color, while in the west it is more often associated with passion or even danger.<br /><br />According to the article Everyday Chinese Superstitions (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/">http://www.associatedcontent.com</a><!-- m -->), if a baby cries when no one is in the room, a ghost is believed to be present. Clipping one’s toenails or fingernails at night will invite ghosts, and dogs are believed to have the unique ability to see ghosts. Soup noodles are never to be cut, as they represent longevity and, while turtles also represent longevity, keeping one as a pet can cause adversely affect your business.<br /><br />One person’s superstition is another person’s firmly-held belief. While many Chinese superstitions may seem odd to westerners, remember that some of the religious beliefs and practices of the majority of Americans and scores of Europeans also neatly fit into the definition of ‘superstition’ and seem highly unusual to many of our friends in the East. We must respect the beliefs of others if we hope to have them respect our own, particularly when those beliefs defy scientific or logical proof. Through education, understanding and tolerance, we can all better appreciate the unique qualities of our own national cultures and those of our neighbors in this ever-shrinking global community.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />1.	What’s the difference between Chinese and Western superstitions? <br />2.	Do you believe in superstitions? Are you superstitious? Why or why not? <br />3.	What are you afraid of? Why? Both tangible ( for example: snake, spider..) and intangible (being alone, failure…) <br />4.	How do you deal with your fears? <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Session II</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">11 Signs You Are a Perfectionist</span><br /><br /><a href="https://personalexcellence.co/blog/perfectionism/" class="postlink">https://personalexcellence.co/blog/perfectionism/</a><br /><br />Are you a <span style="font-weight: bold">perfectionist</span>? Do you often seek to achieve a perfect standard in your work? Do you feel a need to perfect every single thing you do, even at the expense of your health and well-being?<br /><br />A perfectionist is a person who refuses to accept any standard short of perfection. In psychology, perfectionism is a personality trait characterized by<span style="font-weight: bold"> “a person’s striving for flawlessness and setting excessively high performance standards</span>, accompanied by<span style="font-weight: bold"> overly critical self-evaluations and concerns regarding others’ evaluations</span>.”[1] To a perfectionist, anything that’s less than perfect is unacceptable.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Are You a Perfectionist?</span><br /><br />To help you assess your level of perfectionism, here are 11 signs of a perfectionist I’ve identified:<br /><br />1.	There is<span style="font-weight: bold"> no room for mistakes</span>. Whenever you see an error, you’re the first to jump on it and correct it.<br /><br />2.	You have a<span style="font-weight: bold"> very specific manner in which things should be done.</span> Many times, people don’t get you because you’re so specific about how things get done. As long as something is out of place or doesn’t conform to your approach, it’ll not be acceptable. Because of that, you often find it very hard to find the right people to work with; some may find it hard to work with you altogether.<br /><br />3.	You have an <span style="font-weight: bold">all-or-nothing approach</span>. It’s either you do everything well, or you don’t do it at all. Everything in between is a no-go.<br /><br />4.	It’s <span style="font-weight: bold">all about the end result</span>. You don’t care what happens in between or what it takes to achieve the goal. You just want to ensure that the end result is attained; otherwise you’d feel annoyed, devastated.<br /><br />5.	You are <span style="font-weight: bold">extremely hard on yourself</span>. Whenever something goes wrong, you become really hard on yourself. It doesn’t matter if it’s due to your fault or just one small thing — you’re always quick to beat yourself up and feel extremely bad about a mistake for a long, long while.<br /><br />6.	You <span style="font-weight: bold">become depressed when you don’t achieve your goals.</span> You often mull over outcomes that don’t turn out as envisioned. You keep wondering “What if?” Most importantly, you feel that everything must be your fault if you don’t achieve that perfect, desired standard (see #5).<br /><br />7.	You have <span style="font-weight: bold">extremely high standards</span>. Whatever you set your mind to do, you will have high targets. Sometimes, these targets stress you endlessly. You may end up breaking a neck just to reach them. At one point, you become held back by these standards as you procrastinate and stop working on your goals out of fear that you can’t reach them.<br /><br />8.	<span style="font-weight: bold">Success is never enough</span>. Whatever you do, there’s always a greater height to aim for. Even when you achieve X, you want 2X. Even when you achieve 2X, you want 5X. Beyond this desire for betterment, many times you’re just not happy if you don’t go for a higher, bigger goal. You are rarely content with status quo and you keep wanting to see more and better things.<br /><br />9.	You <span style="font-weight: bold">procrastinate just to do something at the “right” moment</span>. You are constantly waiting for the “right” moment to work on your goals. You only want to start when you are “ready,” so as to deliver your best quality of work. However, this state of “readiness” never seems to come sometimes. Sometimes, it never comes as you perpetually wait just to get something done.<br /><br />10.	You <span style="font-weight: bold">constantly spot mistakes when others don’t see any.</span> While this can simply mean that you’re<br /> just very detail-oriented, perfectionists often spot mistakes, issues, from a mile away. Sometimes these mistakes are real. Sometimes they seem self-imagined.<br /><br />11.	You often <span style="font-weight: bold">spend copious amounts of time just to perfect something</span>. Perfection is the end goal. It’s not uncommon for you to sacrifice your sleep, personal time, and well-being, just to bring your work to the highest level. To you, it is all part of achieving your goal.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />1.	Are you a perfectionist? Out of the 11 traits above, how many apply to you?<br />2.	Is perfectionism helping or harming you? Explain your reasoning.<br />3.	What are the benefits and harms of perfectionism? Explain your answer. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Agenda</span><br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />8:10 ~ 8:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:25 ~ 8:30pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:30 ~9:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~9:30pm Concluding remarks/feedback from newcomers<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #0000FF">The meeting place of Thursday:<br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第一區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文<br /></span></span></div>
