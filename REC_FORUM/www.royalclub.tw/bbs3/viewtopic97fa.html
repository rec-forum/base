I'm Alice…<br /><br />Neil<br />And I'm Neil. So, Alice, what do you see when you look at me?<br /><br />Alice<br />Well, male, Caucasian, early 40s, short auburn hair, bushy eyebrows, thin lips... <br /><br />Neil<br />OK. So that's how you see me? It sounds like a police report, and I'm not sure I like your observation about thin lips. Caucasian means white skinned and European, by the way.<br /><br />Alice<br />And today the show is about identity – who or what a person is. And the way people see us forms part of our sense of identity, while another part comes from our ethnic – or racial – identity. So my question for you today, Neil, is:  What percentage of the UK population describe themselves as ethnically mixed? Is it …<br />a) 0.9%?<br />b) 5.9%?<br />Or c) 9%?<br /><br />Neil<br />OK… I think that it's a) 0.9%.<br /><br />Alice<br />Well, we'll find out if you got the answer right or wrong later on in the show. Now, Neil, you are, of course, many more things than my physical description of you!<br /><br />Neil<br />I'm glad to hear that. And it's true, that until you actually hear somebody speak, there are lots of things you can't know about them. For example, which country they're from, what language they speak…<br /><br />Alice<br />Yes. So looking at me, what would you say, Neil? <br /><br />Neil<br />I would say Alice that you're a typical English rose.<br /><br />Alice<br />Thanks, Neil – and English rose describes an attractive girl with a pale delicate complexion – or skin colour – but you can't actually tell where a person is from by the way they look.<br /><br />Neil<br />Yes, I suppose you're right. I have a friend who also looks very English like you, but she's a real ethnic mix. Her dad is German and her mum is Brazilian!<br /><br />Alice<br />Well, let's hear from New York City actress and playwright, Sarah Jones, talking about her complicated ethnicity.<br /><br />INSERT<br />Sarah Jones, actress and playwright, New York City<br />My family on my dad's side, my grandparents, are from the South. There's some Caribbean in there, black Americans from the South and the Caribbean, and then on my mother's side there are people from the Caribbean, from Ireland but you know Irish American, German American. People would ask me if I was adopted when they saw my mother's white skin - she's actually mixed but she's white from a distance, and I'm black from a distance.<br /><br />Neil<br />Sarah Jones there. Well, Sarah has family from all over the world! I suppose the United States - and New York City, especially - is a real melting pot.<br /><br />Alice<br />That's right. And melting pot describes a society made from people of different countries who live together and create a new shared culture.<br /><br />Neil<br />And people think Sarah is adopted – or raised by parents who aren't biologically hers – because she looks so different to her mum.<br /><br />Alice<br />But I expect Sarah sees herself as American. New York is where she was born and raised.<br /><br />Neil<br />That's right. But her grandparents weren't. Do you think you change when you go and live in another country with people different to you?<br /><br />Alice<br />Yes, I do. My neighbours are Turkish but they've lived in England for 45 years so they’ve integrated into our culture. They enjoy English things like… our TV soap operas, cooking turkey at Christmas, and drinking tea with milk.<br /><br />Neil<br />And to integrate means to join a group of people, and often involves changing your habits and customs.<br /><br />Alice<br />Yes. OK. So, Neil, to what extent does the way other people see us, actually change us? Let's listen to Julian Baggini, a writer and philosopher here in the UK and find out what he thinks.<br /><br />INSERT<br />Julian Baggini, writer and philosopher, UK<br />It seems very evident that our sense of self isn't something that comes entirely from within. And of course we're affected by the way other people see us. And that's one of the most formative things in creating our sense of identity. I mean, I think it's kind of a two-way process that's ongoing. Our sense of who we are is always a response in part to how other people see us.<br /><br />Neil<br />So Julian Baggini believes the way other people see us is formative in creating our sense of identity – or who we are. And formative means important for the development of something.<br /><br />Alice<br />So if enough people see you as an English rose, you might start to see yourself as an English rose, even if you aren't ethnically English.<br /><br />Neil<br />I'm not so sure. The friend I talked about earlier, she comes across as much more Brazilian than English in the way she behaves. She doesn't have the famous English reserve – but you'd never know it by looking at her.<br /><br />Alice<br />And reserve means hiding what you're thinking or feeling. I think I'm guilty of English reserve. How about you, Neil?<br /><br />Neil<br />No, I think I wear my heart on my sleeve, Alice – which means I make my feelings clear. OK, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question.<br /><br />Alice<br />Okey-dokey, fair enough. I asked you: What percentage of the UK population described themselves as ethnically mixed? Is it … a) 0.9%, b) 5.9% or c) 9%?<br /><br />Neil<br />I said a) 0.9%.<br /><br />Alice<br />Yes. And you were on the money today, Neil! Well done! According to a survey conducted by the BBC in 2011, when asked about their own ethnic origins, 0.9% of the UK population said they were mixed race, although it's thought that the real figure is 2% or more. Now, could you remind us of the words we heard today, Neil?<br /><br />Neil<br />Sure. They are:<br />Caucasian<br />identity<br />ethnic<br />English rose<br />complexion<br />melting pot<br />adopted<br />integrate<br />formative<br />reserve<br />wear your heart on your sleeve <br /><br />Alice<br />And that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

Can you actually tell where a person is from by the way they look?<br />Q2. Each one looks at his or her partner at the table and then gives a feature or non-physical description of their partners. What do you observe about him or her?<br />Q3. Do others see you as you see yourself? Are you affected by the way other people see you?<br />Q4. What are your distinct identities? How would you describe yourself?<br />Q5. How can appearances be deceptive?<br /><br />Session II:<br />What Not To Do When Watching Your Holiday Movies<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.eslpod.com/eslpod_blog/2018/12/11/what-not-to-do-when-watching-your-holiday-movies/">https://www.eslpod.com/eslpod_blog/2018 ... ay-movies/</a><!-- m --><br />Most Americans get a vacation over the holidays (Christmas and Hanukah), anywhere from a few days to two weeks. So with extra time on their hands (extra time with nothing to do), many of us go to the movie theaters to watch the latest releases (the most recent movies).<br /><br />Sometimes the behavior (the way that one acts) of other people can ruin (make something not as good) the experience of going to see a movie in a movie theater.<br /><br />In the United States, most people expect certain etiquette (polite ways of behaving and interacting with other people) to be followed in a movie theater. Of course, many of these “rules” are the same in other countries.<br /><br />In general, it is rude (not polite or nice) to talk loudly while a movie is playing, because this might distract other people or make it difficult for them to concentrate on the movie.<br /><br />It is also rude to crinkle (move something in one’s hands so that it makes a loud noise) food wrappers (the paper and plastic that food is packaged in) so that other people can’t hear the movie.<br /><br />Cell phones should be turned off for the same reason.<br /><br />It is also rude to block (not let something be seen) other people’s view. For example, movie watchers generally avoid wearing tall hats!<br /><br />If the theater isn’t full and there are many empty seats, it would be rude to sit directly in front of another person. It is always better to sit slightly to the side in the next row (a group of seats in one straight line).<br /><br />Movie theater etiquette requires that people do not stand up and move around the theater more than necessary.<br /><br />If a moviegoer (someone in a theater to watch a movie) has to get up to go to the bathroom, they should stand up, hunch over (slightly bend one’s knees, back, and neck so that one is not as tall as usual) and quietly say “Excuse me!” while waiting for other people in the row to stand up.<br /><br />When that person returns to the row, it’s best to wait for a dull (unexciting) moment in the movie before going back to his or her seat. Otherwise (if you don’t), everyone could miss the exciting action!<br /><br />Q1. What will you do with extra time on your hands over holidays?<br />Q2. Will you go to the movie theaters to watch the latest releases? Why or why not? <br />Q3. Have you had any bad or unforgettable experience of going to see a movie in a movie theater? <br />Q4. What etiquettes should be followed in a movie theater?<br />Q5. What behavior of other people in the theater really bothers you?<br />Q6. What do you like to do when watching a movie in the movie theater?<br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />8:10 ~ 8:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:25 ~ 8:30pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:30 ~9:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~9:30pm Concluding remarks/feedback from newcomers<br /><br />The meeting place of Thursday:<br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第一區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
