Do you agree that social activities will make people live longer?<br />2.	How to make friends with someone who's extremist?<br />3.	How to improve elders living quality?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Session II: How to Plan a Travel Itinerary</span><br /><a href="http://traveltips.usatoday.com/plan-travel-itinerary-27657.html" class="postlink">http://traveltips.usatoday.com/plan-travel-itinerary-27657.html</a><br /><br />Before you travel, creating a document that outlines where you'll go, when you'll arrive and how you'll get there -- an itinerary -- is a common way to ensure that your travels go smoothly after you embark. Itineraries don't have to be binding, but they allow you to represent the proposed trajectory of your trip tangibly, which makes it easier to make last-minute changes that don't affect the overall course of your travels. Planning a basic itinerary is simple to do but requires some time and concentration.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">STEP 1</span><br />Make an ideal outline of all the places you'd like to visit and arrange them in a sequence that makes sense with the local or regional geography. If you're traveling to India, for example, and want to visit the southeastern city of Kolkata, the southwestern city of Mumbai, the northeastern city of Agra, the northern city of Delhi and the northwest city of Jaipur, plan to travel between adjacent cities -- Mumbai to Kolkata or Delhi to Jaipur, for example -- rather than making long hops across the country, which will not only cause you to &quot;backtrack&quot; in your travels, but also cost more.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><br />STEP 2</span><br />Notate ideal travel and accommodation options on your itinerary, even if you don't end up using them. If you're traveling in Europe, download a European rail timetable and make note of two to three trains that run between cities as options to take between them. Make a list of possible hotel options in a given city, either from a travel guide like Lonely Planet or Rough Guides or from online resources like Trip Advisor or Orbitz.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">STEP 3</span><br />Book transport and accommodation in advance whenever your plans are set. If you're traveling internationally, for example, book a round-trip ticket to and from the foreign country before you depart. If, on the other hand, you're traveling to Thailand and know your visa runs out after 30 days, book a train to a neighboring county in advance to avoid paying a penalty.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><br />STEP 4</span><br />Plan for activities within cities and regions whenever possible, again keeping in mind that these may be subject to change -- plan alternates accordingly. Plan activities with the arrangement of your city and region in mind, as well as the time you'll need for an activity. The Palace of Versailles in France, for example, is about 17 miles from the center of Paris and requires not only time to get there and away, but to explore the massive extent of the palace. Plan to visit attractions within the city, such as the Eiffel Tower and Jardin de Luxembourg, on a different day.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">STEP 5</span><br />Remember that itineraries are often tentative and understand that your plans can change -- and they probably will. Use your itinerary not as a fixed representation of where you'll be or what you've been doing at any given time -- and how you'll get there -- but as a means of helping you make abstract travel plans concrete.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />1.
