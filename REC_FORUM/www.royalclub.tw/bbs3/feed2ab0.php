Session1: Here’s what your star sign says about your personality<br /><br />How well does your star sign reflect your personality? Find out here<br /><br />Do you believe in horoscopes? Whether you’re committed to the zodiac like Beyonce, or you think it’s codswallop like Chrissy Teigen, there’s no denying it’s a massive industry.<br /><br />Every day, people fawn over the horoscope pages in magazines and online to find out what’s in store for them over the coming months. Some of us just read them for fun, while others avoid them at all costs.<br /><br />Either way, you can't check your horoscope without first knowing your star sign. Each sign is said to represent a certain type of personality; for example, your traits and characteristics are defined by whether you're a Virgo or a Libra. But does your star sign represent you? Find out below.<br /><br />Aries, 21 March – 20 April<br />Element: Fire<br />Symbol: The Ram<br />Famous Aries: Reese Witherspoon, Jessica Chastain and Mariah Carey<br /><br />Aries are passionate, confident, determined and enthusiastic about everything they do. They’re comfortable taking leadership roles and are happy to take risks in order to achieve their goals. However, Aries tend to get impatient easily, and they can be short-tempered (even aggressive) if things don’t go their way. They don’t like laziness in others and get irritated when they're delayed.<br /><br /><br /><br />Taurus, 21 April – 21 May<br />Element: Earth<br />Symbol: The bull<br />Famous Taureans: Barbra Streisand, Renée Zellweger and Queen Elizabeth II<br /><br />A Taurus is said to be reliable, practical and patient. They like to work with their hands and will spend as much time on any given task as is necessary. They make very trustworthy employees and reliable friends. However, Taureans tends to be stubborn; they stick to their own way of thinking and are reluctant to move away from that. They don’t like sudden changes or being put on the spot.<br /><br /><br /><br />Gemini, 22 May – 21 June<br />Element: Air<br />Symbol: Twins<br />Famous Geminis: Nicole Kidman, Venus Williams and Helena Bonham Carter<br /><br />Gemini’s make very loyal friends. They’re happy to chat with almost anyone they meet and they're affectionate by nature. Geminis are curious and open-minded, making them particularly good writers and artists. However, they can be indecisive and inconsistent. Gemini’s like their lives to be varied; they dislike repetition and routine, preferring to adapt to different people and environments.<br /><br /><br /><br />Cancer, 22 June – 22 July<br />Element: Water<br />Symbol: Crab<br />Famous Cancers: Princess Diana, Nelson Mandela and Meryl Streep<br /><br />People born under the Cancer star sign are highly emotional; this can be both a positive and a negative thing. On the plus side, they are loyal and sympathetic. They’re caring and they empathise with people going through hard times. But, they can also be moody. Cancers lack patience and can occasionally be selfish. If stressed, they relax most when near (or in) water.<br /><br /><br /><br />Leo, 23 July – 22 August<br />Element: Fire<br />Symbol: Lion<br />Famous Leos: Jennifer Lopez, Madonna and Sandra Bullock<br /><br />Leos love the limelight. They’re born for stardom and made for the stage. Leos are creative and funny, and what’s more, they ooze passion. They love the theatre, having fun with friends and expensive things. Like everyone though, Leos have their downsides. As they love to be the centre of attention, a Leo can’t stand being ignored.<br /><br /><br /><br />Virgo, 23 August – 23 September<br />Element: Earth<br />Symbol: Young maiden<br />Famous Virgos: Mother Teresa, Beyonce, Amy Winehouse<br /><br />Virgos pay huge attention to detail; making them analytical, hardworking and well-organised. This can be their downfall, though. Virgos are often overly critical of themselves, putting themselves under huge pressure to achieve the best results possible. That being said, Virgos also have big hearts. They are loyal and empathetic, making them good nurses and caregivers (though careers in writing are common among this star sign too).<br /><br /><br /><br />Libra, 24 September – 23 October<br />Element: Air<br />Symbol: Scales<br />Famous Libras: Serena Williams, Julie Andrews and Susan Sarandon<br /><br />Anyone born under the Libra star sign is said to be a people-person. They’re social, outgoing and hate to be alone. They value individuality and are proud to be themselves. Libras value intellect and like to be stimulated by thoughtful conversations. They’re fair-minded and gentle, and they will avoid conflict at all costs.<br /><br /><br /><br />Scorpio, 24 October – 22 November<br />Element: Water<br />Symbol: Scorpion<br />Famous Scorpios: Julia Roberts, Winona Ryder and Anne Hathaway<br /><br />Scorpios make good leaders. They care about facts and asserting the truth, all the while being resourceful and passionate. They’re trustworthy and will keep a secret when asked. However, this secretive nature can sometimes be seen as a bad thing. Scorpios are also prone to jealousy, which can be harmful to their relationships.<br /><br /><br /><br />Sagittarius, 23 November – 21 December<br />Element: Fire<br />Symbol: Archer<br />Famous Sagittarians: Tina Turner, Jane Fonda and Taylor Swift<br /><br />Sagittarians are open-minded and have a great sense of humour. They love to travel and are enthusiastic about exploring new places with new people. What's more, they’re doers; when they have an idea, they set about making it happen (although they do have a tendency to make promises they can't keep). People born under this sign hate clingy people. They prefer to be free and independent, rather than have others hold them back.<br /><br /><br /><br />Capricorn, 22 December – 20 January<br />Element: Earth<br />Symbol: Goat<br />Famous Capricorns: Kate Middleton, Kate Moss and January Jones<br /><br />Capricorns are responsible and disciplined. They excel in management roles because of their ability to make plans and follow through with them. They’re not the type of person to dilly-dally when deciding where to eat. They have great self-control, which is good, but it can sometimes make them appear stand-offish. Capricorns enjoy music and value their family above all else.<br /><br /><br /><br />Aquarius, January 20 – February 18<br />Element: Air<br />Symbol: Water-bearer<br />Famous Aquarians: Oprah Winfrey, Jennifer Aniston and Sheryl Crow<br /><br />Aquarius-born people are deep thinkers and are always happy to help others. They enjoy meaningful conversations, as well as carrying out humanitarian work. They are often perceived as shy, but they're outgoing when they need to be. Aquarians thrive within a community setting and they care deeply for people, from all walks of life.<br /><br /><br /><br />Pisces, 20 February – 20 March<br />Element: Water<br />Symbol: Fish<br />Famous Pisces: Elizabeth Taylor, Rihanna and Albert Einstein<br /><br />Pisces are kind and caring. They’ll do anything to make someone else’s life easier, demonstrating compassion and wisdom as they go. They enjoy musicals and romance, though they are prone to avoiding reality. While they’re overly-trusting and can be taken advantage of easily, Pisces are also very forgiving.<br /><br />Questions:<br />1.Do you believe horoscopes? <br />2.Do your personalities match the features article describing?<br />3.Do you believe Chinese zodiac or blood type to describe personality?<br />4.Is your horoscope compatible with your lover's or partner's?<br />5.Does your horoscope influence your life, decision, or fate?<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Session2: Apple's announcement of iphone 12<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Questions:<br />1.Do you like iphone 12?
