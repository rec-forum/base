Good health can also bring more wealth your way by helping you save money.<br />“Getting personally and financially fit are really similar,” says JT, a pseudonym for the founder of a personal finance blog. “Your calorie intake is like your spending. Eat fewer calories than you use, and you lose weight. Spend less money than you make, and you save.”<br />Making certain lifestyle changes that will save you money could be a smart move if you’re working toward a financial goal, like saving up for retirement, planning for a large purchase, building up your emergency fund or cutting back on spending. You can set aside any extra cash you save from getting healthy for the future.<br />But does that mean you have to completely overhaul your daily routine? Nope. Not at all. Here are five ways to save money without drastically changing your lifestyle:<br />1. Get moving                                               <br />Exercising can lead to better health, and it’s one of the easiest lifestyle changes to make if you want to save more money.<br />Kelan Kline, who co-founded a personal finance blog with his wife Brittany, set a goal in the fall of 2016 to lose 40 pounds by the beginning of the following summer. To merge his passion for frugality with a desire to stay fit, he aimed to lose weight while spending as little money as possible.<br />Instead of paying for a monthly gym membership at a private club, he and his wife got a yearly membership to the gym at their local college for just $45. They also turned to the great outdoors for exercise, choosing to bike, swim, hike and walk to stay active.<br />“The beauty of working out is you can literally do it anywhere,” Kline says, and it doesn’t have to cost a fortune.<br />“Getting personally and financially fit are really similar. Your calorie intake is like your spending. Eat fewer calories than you use, and you lose weight. Spend less money than you make, and you save.”<br />– JT, founder of a personal finance blog<br />2. Ditch one bad habit<br />When you’re looking for ways to save money without drastically changing your lifestyle, try getting rid of one thing that may be hurting your health and your wallet.<br />Michelle Clardie, founder of a personal finance blog focused on helping young women hone their money management skills, says smokers might consider kicking the habit. This is a great example of a lifestyle change that will save you money.<br />Assume you spend $7 a day on cigarettes. By going cold turkey, you could save $2,555 a year, Clardie says. And, if your insurance costs were to decrease by $100 a month as a result, you could add another $1,200 to your savings. With that money alone, you’d be more than halfway to fully funding an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) for the year. For 2021, the annual contribution limit for both traditional and Roth IRAs is $6,000, with an extra $1,000 allowed for savers 50 and older.<br />Other lifestyle changes to make if you want to save more money might include cutting out soda and alcohol, or dialing back on how often you consume them. Both could make you healthier while also leaving you more money to add to your savings.<br />3. Skip dinner out<br />Eating out can be a serious budget buster. Aside from draining your wallet, it’s easy to pack on the pounds if you’re not mindful of what you’re eating at your favorite restaurants.<br />Anna Dunn Tabke, principal at an investment firm based in Atlanta, recommends meal planning when making lifestyle changes that will save you money. It can take some getting used to, she says, but it’s worth it—both for your health and your finances.<br />“When we started meal planning, it would take us over an hour on Sunday to go through cookbooks and pick meals,” she says. “Now that we’ve been doing it for a few months, it only takes us 10 to 20 minutes and has saved us about 10 percent off our monthly grocery bill.”<br />If you’re spending $200 a month eating out, cooking at home can be a great way to save money without drastically changing your lifestyle. If you were to eliminate such spending entirely, you would have another $2,400 a year that you could funnel into a retirement account, emergency fund or high-yield savings account, for example. Even if you were to cut back on meals by a third, that would free up $800 a year for your savings.<br />4. Eat fresh<br />Cooking at home is a lifestyle change that will save you money, but to reap the most health benefits, it’s important to choose the right ingredients. That means steering clear of processed foods in favor of fresh alternatives. The assumption that going organic means going broke is not necessarily the case.<br />“A lot of people think that eating healthy costs a bunch of money,” Kline says. “The reality is you can eat well on a budget.” Reports have found that while some organic items may be more expensive, others may be priced the same or less than their non-organic counterparts. It all hinges on what you buy, where you shop and what’s on sale at any given time.<br />Clardie says if you’re looking for a healthy lifestyle change that will save you money, it’s all about choices. That might mean splurging for organic versions of the “dirty dozen”—produce that can be heavy with chemicals when grown conventionally. This list includes celery, peaches, strawberries, apples, nectarines, sweet bell peppers, spinach, cherries and grapes. You can opt to purchase non-organic (and less expensive) versions of the “clean 15,” produce with little or no trace of pesticides and therefore safe to consume even when not grown organically. This list includes onions, avocados, mangos, cabbage, eggplant and grapefruit.<br />Eating fresh—and tracking your calories while you’re at it—are two relatively low-key lifestyle changes that will save you money and give your health a boost.<br />“A lot of people think that eating healthy costs a bunch of money. The reality is you can eat well on a budget.”<br />– Kelan Kline, co-founder of a personal finance blog<br />5. Take advantage of employee health benefits<br />Other ways to save money without drastically changing your lifestyle might be right under your nose if you have certain health benefits through your job. A health and wellness program, for example, could help you slim down and spend less.<br />Wellness programs are designed to offer workers incentives to get and stay healthy. Yours might feature benefits like a discounted gym membership, rewards for reaching certain health goals and programs to help you quit smoking or lose weight.<br />A Health Savings Account (HSA) is another benefit you don’t want to overlook if you’re considering lifestyle changes to make if you want to save more money. These accounts, which are linked to high-deductible health insurance plans, allow you to save money for future health care expenses in a tax-advantaged way.<br />For 2021, for example, you can save up to $3,600 in an HSA if you have individual coverage, or up to $7,200 if you have family coverage. You can then use those funds to pay for medical expenses as the need arises and, unlike a Flexible Spending Account, the money rolls over from year to year. Your contributions are also tax-deductible, which reduces your taxable income for the year, potentially reducing your tax bill or boosting your refund.<br />If your lifestyle changes keep you healthy, your HSA can double as a retirement account down the line. After age 65 or Medicare eligibility, you can tap this money without penalty for any reason. You’ll just pay income tax on withdrawals that aren’t used for health care.<br />Start small when making lifestyle changes that will save you money<br />Knowing what lifestyle changes to make if you want to save more money is important if you’re working toward a financial goal. You don’t necessarily have to make all the changes outlined here, however. Adopting just one or two of these lifestyle changes that will save you money could make a positive difference in your physical and financial health over the long term.<br />1.

You ask them, by a show of hands, how many people have complaints about their jobs. Almost all of them raise their hands. The top complaint? Most likely it has something to do with money.<br />With cost-of-living expenses going up, living on a starting salary is harder than ever -- especially if you're trying to make your way in a big city like New York, San Francisco or Chicago. But everyone has to begin somewhere, and starting salaries are all part of the journey (or so you keep telling yourself).<br />The problem is: How do you afford all of the expenses in your life while making what you're getting paid?  For many people, the answer is finding a second job. If you aren't sure whether that's the right option for you, take a look at these questions to ask yourself when considering whether to find a second source of income:<br />What's Your Financial Situation?<br />Again, one of the most common reasons people begin to look for second jobs is to make a little extra cash. Part-time jobs are a good way to supplement income or even come up with a little extra spending money.<br />However, second jobs are not without their disadvantages, especially in the long-term (more on that later). That said, it's a good idea to ask yourself how long you would have to work a second job to get back on track financially and whether you could solve your money woes by sticking to a strict budget instead.<br />If you need extra money for a specific expense in the future-- say, you're moving to a new apartment and need to save up for movers, deposits, fees, and everything else involved-- getting a second job for the short-term may be your best option. However, it's a good idea to give yourself a tentative time frame. That way, you can develop a budget for the months you're making extra money and look forward to the days of freedom in your not-so-far future.<br />PROMOTED<br />How's Your Overall Job Security?<br />Another reason getting a second job may benefit you? If you're worried about your job security at your current one. For many young people, even a few weeks of not working after losing a job and before finding another one can be the difference between on-time rent payments and an angry landlord. For that reason, it's important to have a backup plan if you think you may be without a job in the near future.<br />Could You Benefit?<br />Whether you're looking to save money, get discounts, or further your career, second jobs can have a lot of benefits. If you love clothes, for example, a retail job that offers employee discounts may help you fund this obsession without overspending.<br />But that's not the only way you can benefit from picking up extra work. If you can find a part-time gig in your industry, it may provide you with opportunities to network and gain valuable skills and insight.<br />Are You Interested in Another Industry?<br />Or, if you aren't crazy about the industry you're working in, a second job could allow you to gain experience in a different type of career altogether. Like your college internships, part-time opportunities may allow you to explore options you hadn't considered before or find your calling in an industry you aren't completely familiar with.<br />Will It Be Too Much?<br />Second jobs can certainly be beneficial for your life and career, but what about their drawbacks? A major one you should keep in mind if you're considering picking up extra work is burnout.<br />Many people find themselves exhausted physically and mentally after working two jobs for more than a couple of months, and this can take a huge toll on your body and your mind. That's why it's a good idea to consider a short-term second job.<br />Will It Interfere?<br />Another potential negative: Sometimes second jobs are demanding enough that they actually start to interfere with the work you're accomplishing at your main job. In other words, the time you spend and the energy you dedicate somewhere else could mean you're taking less time and spending less energy where it counts the most.<br />Even if you decide to take a second job, keep this in mind, and make sure you're putting enough into the job that will advance your career the most.<br />What's Your Priority?<br />So, all that said, what's the verdict? Is a second job the right choice for you? To make the decision, you must prioritize. Would you rather make extra money while splitting your focus and potentially burning out? Or, is putting yourself on a tight budget, living a bit more frugally than you're used to, but having free time to unwind and let loose a better option for you?<br />Living on a starting salary isn't easy, but remember: Whether you decide to get a second job for now or develop a budget that helps you spend less, it won't last forever!<br />Rent.com<br />Follow<br />Rent.com is a leading rental listing website dedicated to giving renters a convenient way to find the perfect place to li<br />Questions<br />1 Is it worth having a second job?<br />2 What is your regular job? If you want to have a side hustle, which kind of jobs do you prefer?<br />3 What are the pros and cons of working a second job?                      <br />4 Do you pay more tax if you have two jobs?<br /><br />P.S.<br />1.因聚會地點是在咖啡店內，所以有低消80元喔。<br />2.參加三次後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />3.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~</div>
