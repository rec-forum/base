			<div class="content">6/22(Sat.)10 Modern Manner Mistakes | Bad Etiquette That KILLS First Impressions/Japan’s Rent-a-Family Industry(Host:Amy)<br /><br /><br />Article 1: 10 Modern Manner Mistakes | Bad Etiquette That KILLS First Impressions<br />   <br />1. Making Your Phone More Important Than People<br /><br />In this day and age, we’re so immersed in instant connectivity that it affects our face-to-face communication. It sadly looks like many of us give our phones (or other gadgets) priority over people in our presence. The worst part is when you’re in the middle of a conversation and you hear your phone ring. There are times it’s some random call from a company trying to sell you something – but you get the urge to answer anyway. So I suggest that you set the phone to silent mode (or even turn it off) whenever you’re engaging with someone for a while. Of course, there’s an exception if you’re legitimately expecting a call – work-related matters, family emergencies, your pregnant wife is due, etc. Remember to politely excuse yourself, keep the call brief and join back in if there’s nothing urgent. The last thing you want is to put the current conversation on hold for another one that takes just as long.But in all other cases when you interact with family or friends, they deserve your full attention. Check out this powerful speech on YouTube that sums up the downsides of modern technology – how it has made us “more selfish and separate than ever” in a way. So learn to put aside and not think about your phone or Facebook. You’re not meant to live FOR them.<br /><br /><br />2. Saying Something Online That You Wouldn’t Say In Person<br /><br />You might think of the World Wide Web as an alternate reality, but it’s just a platform to expose yourself to the real world – and masses of REAL people. Don’t be naïve to think whatever you post online won’t come back to bite you. Back in 2013, a woman who was head of corporate communications for a New York-based Internet company (of all things!) put out a racist Tweet about AIDS before flying to South Africa for vacation. It only took the span of that 11-hour flight for her “joke” to go viral and turn her into a notorious public figure. She came back home and was fired.Granted, that’s a pretty extreme example. Most of you wouldn’t think to do something like that. But the message there is clear: once someone else sees what you post, there’s no taking it back. It doesn't have to be in social media – it can be any email or text that you don’t write carefully.Here’s the golden rule about communicating with your device – always ask if it’s something you’d have the courage to say face-to-face. That rules out hateful or derogatory posts. That means when you discuss sensitive issues, you have to choose your words wisely.Just take a look at this past presidential election and all the fights it caused online. People were unfriending each other – and that obviously affected their relationships offline. So always triple-check whatever you’re about to post (and try saying it out loud).<br /><br /><br /> 3. Not Practicing Good Manners At Home<br /><br />People underestimate how much influence their habits at home have. If you’re not making an effort to stop picking your nose at home, you’re likely to unknowingly do it in public. I, unfortunately, know people who do – and I don’t like shaking their hands!<br /><br /><br />4. Not Being Punctual<br /><br />My time in the Marine Corps has taught me the value of punctuality. Yes, it’s a good habit on its own and it lessens those stressful mornings when you’re in a rush. But it’s not primarily for you – but for the other person. The truth is when you’re late, you’re wasting someone else’s time. That person has done their part to meet you at a time you both agreed on. So even if it’s unintentional – making them wait is like ripping them off. You’re not robbing them of cash but of something more valuable… their time. I recommend being 10 to 15 minutes early to anything. That being said, if it turns out you have to be late – always have the courtesy to call or text the other person. The sooner they know about it, the better. Otherwise, it’s only going to hurt your reputation in the long run. <br /><br /><br />5. Not Having Situational Awareness<br /><br />As big as the world is, we should still have an awareness of everything around us. Especially when we see people who clearly need help – an old woman carrying a bunch of grocery bags, or a new guy in town who looks a little lost. It’s in our nature to help out. When it comes to situational awareness, there’s no more dramatic example than when Peter Parker’s uncle died in the 2002 Spider-Man film. It’s a tragic scene – one minute Peter lets a criminal escape out of revenge, and the next minute that criminal shoots his uncle. The line “I missed the part where that’s my problem” couldn’t have been more ironic. But that was Peter’s turning point. He realized he had a responsibility that was bigger than himself. And like him, we all share a responsibility for our environment. Making someone’s (particularly a stranger’s) life easier out of kindness – that’s the sign of a true, well-mannered gentleman.<br /><br /><br />6. Not Showing Respect At Work<br /><br />It’s easy to have just graduated from a top university and feel like a force to be reckoned with. But reality check – it’s completely different when you start working. It doesn’t matter how many A+ grades or achievements you’ve had. It’s not the time and place for your ego. You’re starting from the bottom. You don’t know everything and a lot of what you learned in school won’t matter for now. So respect your managers and colleagues despite their backgrounds. They’re the ones with the experience. And don’t try to act silly in front of the boss! Anne Hathaway’s character in The Devil Wears Prada chuckled during a meeting and called the fashion world “stuff” – only to be roasted by Meryl Streep. Don't risk making jokes when you’re new. If your coworkers think you’re not serious, they won’t listen to you or even want to work with you. Know your place.<br /><br /><br />7. Constantly Interrupting<br /><br />This goes in line with being respectful at work (and even everywhere else). You shouldn’t walk into a room and start spouting things while other people are talking. You shouldn’t jump in or cut them off when they’re trying to explain something.It’s especially crucial to control your mouth in the office. By interrupting a colleague – you act like you fully understand them before they even finish. You might throw comments without the whole context in mind. And that can lead them to view you as someone arrogant or domineering. Remember – we each have 2 ears and 1 mouth. So that probably means we should listen more than we talk, and listen a lot before we talk.<br /><br /><br />8. Overusing Foul Language<br /><br />Curse words may sound cool in rap songs or make great punchlines in movies. But don’t overuse them. You know how the F-word can serve as an adverb (like f—ing stupid or f—ing cold)? If you use it every other sentence in a conversation, you’ll end up turning people off. Those who have that habit are seen as classless or uneducated. And it can be uncomfortable for those who don’t hear that kind of language often. So you have to treat curse words as “special” words – they shouldn’t be abused and should only be spoken to emphasize something (not everything!).<br /><br /><br />9. Having No Patience<br /><br />This one has a lot to do with empathy – as in putting yourself in other people's shoes. Maybe you’re a workaholic, and that’s perfectly fine. You have the drive to make great things happen but you also rely on the help of others. It’s very likely that those guys at home face different situations. They may have kids or obligations that don’t allow them to be as quick to respond as you’d like. That’s why you need to understand them and find a way to compromise. If they can’t email you back by 8 p.m. on a given day, ask yourself if it’s a really big deal. It might turn out that 10 p.m. works better for them – and you actually don’t mind. Those little acts of patience make a huge difference in your professional and personal relationships.<br />10. Not Making Introductions -Lastly, don’t downgrade the value of introductions. I notice men who’ve been speaking to one person for a couple of minutes, while their good friend is just idly standing beside them. It’s clear that the two don’t know each other – so it’s up to the mutual guy to make a quick introduction and mention names. Learn to be the “cool” one and take this initiative. That’s how you make everyone comfortable in these types of situations. And you’ll end up being thanked for an enjoyable event – or even new friendships formed.<br /><br /><br />Discussion:<br />1.	Many of us give our phones priority over people in our presence while the phones are ringing. How about you ?<br />2.	Some of manner mistakes are easily ignored by us. Do you think that you probably have some manner mistakes?<br />3.	Do you think that empathy - “Putting yourself in other people’s shoes” is important to make a huge difference in personal relationship ?<br />4.	We each have 2 ears and 1 mouth so that probably means we should listen more than we talk and listen a lot before we talk . What is your opinion?<br /><br />////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////<br /><br />Article2 : Japan’s Rent-a-Family Industry<br /><br /><br />People who are short on relatives can hire a husband, a mother, a grandson. The resulting relationships can be more real than you’d expect. By Elif Batuman, April 23, 2018<br /><br />Two years ago, Kazushige Nishida, a Tokyo salaryman in his sixties, started renting a part-time wife and daughter. His real wife had recently died. Six months before that, their daughter, who was twenty-two, had left home after an argument and never returned. “I thought I was a strong person,” Nishida told me, when we met one night in February, at a restaurant near a train station in the suburbs. “But when you end up alone you feel very lonely.” Tall and slightly stooped, Nishida was wearing a suit and a gray tie. He had a deep voice and a gentle, self-deprecating demeanor. Of course, he said, he still went to work every day, in the sales division of a manufacturing company, and he had friends with whom he could go out for drinks or play golf. But at night he was completely alone. He thought he would feel better over time. Instead, he felt worse. He tried going to hostess clubs. Talking to the ladies was fun, but at the end of the night you were alone again, feeling stupid for having spent so much money. Then he remembered a television program he had seen, about a company called Family Romance, one of a number of agencies in Japan that rent out replacement relatives. One client, an elderly woman, had spoken enthusiastically about going shopping with her rental grandchild. “The grandchild was just a rental, but the woman was still really happy,” Nishida recalled.<br />Nishida contacted Family Romance and placed an order for a wife and a daughter to join him for dinner. On the order form, he noted his daughter’s age, and his wife’s physique: five feet tall and a little plump. The cost was forty thousand yen, about three hundred and seventy dollars. The first meeting took place at a café. The rental daughter was more fashionable than Nishida’s real daughter—he used the English word “sharp”—but the wife immediately impressed him as “an ordinary, generic middle-aged woman.” He added, “Unlike, for example, Ms. Matsumoto”—he nodded toward my interpreter, Chie Matsumoto—“who might look like a career woman.” Chie, a journalist, teacher, and activist, who has spiky salt-and-pepper hair and wears plastic-framed glasses, laughed as she translated this qualification. The wife asked Nishida for details about how she and the daughter should act. Nishida demonstrated the characteristic toss of the head with which his late wife had rearranged her hair, and his daughter’s playful way of poking him in the ribs. Then the women started acting. The rental wife called him Kazu, just as his real wife had, and tossed her head to shake back her hair. The rental daughter playfully poked him in the ribs. An observer would have taken them for a real family. Nishida booked a second meeting. This time, the wife and daughter came to his house. The wife cooked okonomiyaki, a kind of pancake that Nishida’s late wife had made,  while Nishida chatted with the daughter. Then they ate dinner together and watched television. More family dinners followed, usually at Nishida’s house, though one time they went out for monjayaki, another variety of pancake beloved by the late Mrs. Nishida. It hadn’t been a fancy meal, and Nishida wondered whether he should have taken the women, who were, after all, his guests, to a nicer place. Then again, in real life, the Nishidas hadn’t gone to any of those nicer places. Before another meeting, it occurred to Nishida to send Family Romance a copy of his house key. When he came home from work that night, the lights were on, the house was warm, and a wife and daughter were there to say, “Welcome home.” “That was very nice,” Nishida recalled, smiling slightly. He said he didn’t miss the women when they left—not with any sense of urgency or longing. But he did think, “It would be nice to spend some time like that with them again.”<br />Nishida said that, although he still calls them by the names of his wife and daughter, and the meetings still take the form of family dinners, the women have, to some extent, stopped acting and “turned into their own selves.” The rental wife sometimes “breaks out of the shell of the rental family” enough to complain about her real husband, and Nishida gives her advice. With this loosening of the roles, he realized that he, too, had been acting, playing the part of “a good husband and father,” trying not to seem too miserable, telling his daughter how to hold her rice bowl. Now he felt lighter, able for the first time to talk about his real daughter, about how shocked he had been when she announced her decision to move in with a boyfriend he had never met, and how they had argued and broken off contact. On the subject of the real daughter, the rental daughter had a lot to say: as someone in her early twenties, she could tell that Nishida hadn’t spoken correctly, or expressed himself in the right way. He’d made it hard for his daughter to apologize and it was up to him to create an opening. “Your daughter is waiting for you to call her,” she told him. To me, this sentence had the eerie ring of something uttered at a séance. Nishida himself seemed uncertain about how and for whom the rental daughter had spoken. “She was acting as a rental daughter, but at the same time she was telling me how she felt as a real daughter,” he said. “And yet, if it was a real father-daughter relationship, maybe she wouldn’t have spoken this honestly.” Eventually, Nishida called his daughter—something he says he wouldn’t have done if the rental substitute hadn’t helped him see her point of view. It took a few tries to get through, but they were eventually able to talk. One day, he came home from work to find fresh flowers for his wife on the family altar, and he understood that his daughter had been at the house while he was gone. “I’ve been telling her to come home,” he said carefully, folding and refolding a hand towel that the waitress had brought him. “I’m hoping to meet her again soon.”  <br /><br /><br />Discussion<br />1.	Do you agree that money talks? It can buy everything, even “LOVE”.<br />2.	Are you willing to spend money on renting part-time relatives, such as wife/husband or daughters/sons, if it is necessary ?<br />3.

What’s your opinions about - “Women get marriage to a younger men” ?<br />4.
