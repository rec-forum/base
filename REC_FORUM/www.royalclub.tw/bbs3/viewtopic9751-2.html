Meaning, though, is deeper,&quot; Smith said.<br /><br />Citing psychologist Martin Seligman, she pointed out that &quot;meaning comes from belonging to and serving something beyond yourself and from developing the best within you.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Everyone said the path to happiness was success, so I searched for that ideal job, that perfect boyfriend, that beautiful apartment,&quot; Smith said, a topic she elaborates on in her recently published book &quot;The Power of Meaning.&quot; <br /><br />But what Smith found was that by chasing happiness, she felt &quot;anxious and adrift,&quot; which scientific research has proven to be normal.<br /><br />This feeling was explored in a 2011 study titled &quot;Can seeking happiness make people unhappy? Paradoxical effects of valuing happiness&quot; published by the American Psychological Association.<br /><br />Researchers found that chasing happiness can be self-defeating, &quot;because the more people value happiness, the more likely they will feel disappointed.&quot; <br />&quot;Even though life is getting objectively better by nearly every conceivable standard, more people feel hopeless, depressed and alone,&quot; Smith said.<br /><br />But when it comes to those who pursue meaning and find it, Smith said they are &quot;more resilient, they do better in school and at work and they even live longer.&quot; <br /><br />To find out how people can live more meaningful lives, Smith spent five years interviewing hundreds of people and sorted through psychology, neuroscience and philosophy research.<br /><br />For those who may not know where to start to live a more meaningful life, Smith details these <span style="font-weight: bold">four pillars </span>to help set you on a more fulfilling path.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Value others and find people who value you</span><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">The first pillar of meaning is &quot;belonging</span>,&quot; which Smith said comes from &quot;being in relationships where you're valued for who you are intrinsically and where you value others as well.&quot; The clearest examples of sharing this bond can be seen between yourself and your family or friends.<br /><br />But Smith warned that you shouldn't confuse this with &quot;cheap forms of belonging,&quot; where people only value you not for who you are, but for what you believe or who you hate.<br /><br />&quot;True belonging springs from love. It lives in moments among individuals and it's a choice,&quot; she said. &quot;You can choose to cultivate belonging with others.&quot;<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Find your purpose</span><br /><br />&quot;Finding your purpose is not the same thing as finding that job that makes you happy,&quot; Smith said. &quot;Purpose is less about what you want than about what you give.&quot;<br /><br />Smith explained that the key to purpose is &quot;using your strengths to serve others.&quot;<br /><br />Given that American adults spend a majority of their time at work, Smith said it makes sense that we channel our sense of purpose through our jobs, where we contribute a lot of our time and feel needed.<br /><br />But as Smith pointed out, the lack of purpose Americans feel at work is translating into &quot;disengagement at work, unemployment and low labor force participation.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Of course, you don't have to find purpose at work, but purpose gives you something to live for,&quot; Smith said, adding it gives you a reason to move forward.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><br />Experience transcendence</span><br /><br />&quot;Transcendent states are those rare moments when you're lifted above the hustle and bustle of daily life, your sense of self fades away and you feel connected to a higher reality,&quot; Smith said.<br /><br />In other words, it's an experience that feels larger than life. But different people will experience transcendence in different ways.<br /><br />For Smith, transcendence looks like getting &quot;so in the zone&quot; while writing that she loses all sense of time and place.<br /><br />In 2015, University of California - Berkeley researchers Paul Piff and Dacher Keltner published a study on the emotional response of awe, which they described in The New York Times as &quot;that often-positive feeling of being in the presence of something vast that transcends our understanding of the world.&quot;<br /><br />In the study, students who looked up at 200-feet-tall eucalyptus trees for one minute felt less self-centered and even behaved more generously when given the chance to help someone, Smith explained. She recommends people place themselves in more moments like these.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Be in control of your life story</span><br /><br />Smith explained that when you speak with someone or write about events that have taken place in your life on any given day, you are creating a narrative that helps you understand how you became you. <br /><br />&quot;We don't always realize that we're the authors of our stories and can change the way we're telling them,&quot; Smith said. &quot;Your life isn't just a list of events. You can edit, interpret and retell your story, even as you're constrained by the facts.&quot;<br /><br />Even if you aren't thrilled about how things in your life are playing out, Smith said seeing a therapist or finding time to reflect in a thoughtful way allows you to understand your life in a more meaningful way.<br /><br />&quot;Happiness comes and goes,&quot; Smith said, &quot;but when life is really good and when things are really bad, having meaning gives you something to hold on to.&quot;<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />1.	How do you define a happy life and a meaningful life? What’s the difference between them?<br />2.	According to the article, which one of the four pillars is the most important to you in pursuit of a meaningful life?<br />3.	Looking ahead, what’s life story do you want to tell? What would you do to make your life more meaningful?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Session II</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Amazon to roll out delivery at Whole Foods</span><br /><br /><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/kale-amazon-roll-delivery-foods-52929529" class="postlink">https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/kale-amazon-roll-delivery-foods-52929529</a><br /><br />NEW YORK — Feb 8, 2018, 3:10 PM ET<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Amazon is bringing its speedy delivery to Whole Foods.</span><br /><br />The online retail giant plans to roll out two-hour delivery at the organic grocer this year to those who pay for Amazon's $99-a-year<span style="font-weight: bold"> Prime membership.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">It is the company's biggest move since it bought the organic grocer last year.<br /></span><br />It's also precisely the action rivals have been preparing for since the day Amazon — with the Prime program that's been so successful in cementing customer loyalty — announced plans to buy Whole Foods.<br /><br />Amazon shoppers can order meat, seafood and other Whole Foods grocery items through the Prime Now app and website. Deliveries started Thursday in Austin, Texas; Cincinnati; Dallas; and Virginia Beach, Virginia; and will expand nationwide this year.<br /><br />One of the biggest hurdles for the growth of grocery delivery is that many people want to pick out their own eggs or fruit, said Darren Seifer, a food and beverage industry analyst at NPD Group.<br /><br />&quot;There are always going to be people who want their bananas a little green,&quot; he said.<br /><br />Ade Ogbomo, a teacher in Dallas, said she orders everything from Amazon — except food.<br /><br />&quot;I like to get it myself,&quot; she said outside a Whole Foods store. She worries about the possible mishaps: &quot;Maybe the bananas are bruised or the cookies are all broken up, and you can't really complain because you asked for it.&quot;<br /><br />About 7 percent of U.S. households bought groceries online last year, according to NPD Group. Most of those — about three-quarters — get their orders delivered to their doors; the rest pick it up at the store. NPD Group said it expects online grocery shopping to grow quickly, especially among young adults, who are more comfortable shopping online.<br /><br />And grocery chains don't want to miss out when that happens.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Walmart</span>, the country's largest grocer, is making it easier for customers to order groceries online and pick them up at the store. <span style="font-weight: bold">Target </span>bought grocery-delivery company Shipt late last year. <span style="font-weight: bold">Kroger</span>, the largest traditional supermarket chain, has been promoting store pickup for online orders and doing trials of home delivery.<br /><br />For <span style="font-weight: bold">Amazon</span>, items will be pulled from Whole Foods stores, bagged and then delivered by Amazon drivers. <span style="font-weight: bold">Amazon</span>, based in Seattle, said there's no extra fee for two-hour deliveries above $35, but one-hour delivery will cost $8. The company isn't saying where delivery will expand, but its<span style="font-weight: bold"> Prime Now service </span>is in more than 30 cities, including Chicago, Milwaukee and San Diego.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">The announcement gives Amazon yet another way to get groceries to customer's doorsteps.<br /><br /></span>It already does so through AmazonFresh, but that requires a $15-a-month fee. And Prime Now delivers groceries from its facilities, but it has also offered grocery delivery from other physical stores, including Whole Foods rival Sprouts Farmers Market.<br /><br />Whole Foods also offers delivery in some cities through a partnership with delivery service Instacart, which will continue.<br /><br />Buying Whole Foods was the biggest part of a push into physical retail for the chain known for online shopping. Right after taking over Whole Foods, Amazon made a splash by cutting prices on bananas, yogurt and other items. It also began selling Kindle e-readers in some of its 470 stores, and started selling Whole Foods-branded food on its site.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />1.	Do you know anything about Whole Food Grocery and Amazon Prime membership and? What’s the advantage of becoming Amazon prime membership? Have you ever bought products from Amazon, why and why not?<br />2.	What’s Amazon’s ambition behind the plan to <span style="text-decoration: underline">roll out two-hour delivery of groceries for online orders</span>? Do you think it will cause a big impact in US or even outside US?<br />3.	What’s the biggest hurdle for the growth of grocery delivery? Who would prefer this kind of service?<br />4.	Do you think Amazon’s grocery delivery service will succeed in terms of gaining profits or market share? <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Agenda</span><br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />8:10 ~ 8:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:25 ~ 8:30pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:30 ~9:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~9:30pm Concluding remarks/feedback from newcomers<br />The meeting place of Thursday:<br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #FF0040">丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第一區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<br /></span></span>最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
