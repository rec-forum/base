			<div class="content">Breakfast: Is It the Most Important Meal?<br /><br />Breakfast kick-starts your metabolism, helping you burn calories throughout the day. It also gives you the energy you need to get things done and helps you focus at work or at school. Those are just a few reasons why it’s the most important meal of the day. Many studies have linked eating breakfast to good health, including better memory and concentration, lower levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol, and lower chances of getting diabetes, heart disease, and being overweight. It’s hard to know, though, if breakfast causes these healthy habits or if people who eat it have healthier lifestyles. But this much is clear: Skipping the morning meal can throw off your body’s rhythm of fasting and eating. When you wake up, the blood sugar your body needs to make your muscles and brain work their best is usually low. Breakfast helps replenish it. If your body doesn’t get that fuel from food, you may feel zapped of energy -- and you'll be more likely to overeat later in the day. Breakfast also gives you a chance to get in some vitamins and nutrients from healthy foods like dairy, grains, and fruits. If you don’t eat it, you aren’t likely to get all of the nutrients your body needs. Many people skip the a.m. meal because they’re rushing to get out the door. That’s a mistake. You need food in your system long before lunchtime.  If you don’t eat first thing, you may get so hungry later on that you snack on high-fat, high sugar foods.<br />Breakfast and Your Weight<br />Can a morning meal be good for your waistline? Some studies say yes. Researchers have found that, on average, people who eat breakfast are thinner than those who don’t. That could be because eating foods with protein and fiber in the morning keeps your appetite in check the rest of the day. But it doesn’t guarantee you’ll fit into those skinny jeans. A recent study compared weight loss among people who ate breakfast with those with didn’t. The meal didn’t make any difference. If you’re dieting, don’t think cutting calories by skipping the meal will help. Studies show that most people who lose weight and keep the weight off eat breakfast every day. On the other hand, you need to pay attention to what, when, and how much you eat.  One study showed that people who had large breakfasts ate more during the day.<br />Why Kids Need Breakfast<br />Sometimes children don’t feel like eating in the morning, but it’s important that they do. Their growing bodies need the nutrients and fuel. Kids who don’t eat in the a.m. have a harder time focusing, and they become more tired in school. They may also be cranky or restless. And it isn’t just their moods that can suffer. Their school work can, too. One study showed that kids who ate breakfast had higher test scores than those who didn’t. Most children don’t get all the vitamins and minerals they need from just lunch and dinner. Kids who skip breakfast are more likely to eat junk food during the day and be overweight. One study showed that teenagers who ate breakfast every day had a lower body mass index (BMI) -- a measure of body fat based on height and weight -- than teens who never ate the meal or who sometimes did. If your youngster doesn’t want to eat in the morning at home, pack something he can have on the way to school or between classes. Opt for fruit, nuts, or half a peanut butter and banana sandwich.<br />A Doughnut Won’t Do<br />You don’t need to eat a big meal for breakfast, but it’s a good idea to have something small within an hour of waking up. Even last night’s leftovers zapped in the microwave will do. Resist that pastry or doughnut, though. Your best bet is a mix of foods that have carbohydrates, protein, healthy fats, and fiber. Carbs will give you energy right away, and the protein will give you it later on. Fiber keeps you feeling full. Try a whole-grain cereal, low-fat milk and fruit, or a breakfast smoothie made from low-fat yogurt, fruit, and a teaspoon of bran. Nuts or whole-grain granola bars are also easy options.<br />Discussions:<br />a.	Do you eat breakfast every morning or skip it ? Some people eat more food at dinner than breakfast because you have more time to enjoy it. How about you ?  <br />b.	According to the articles, some people don’t eat breakfast. But those don’t eat breakfast may get so hungry later on and snack on high-fat, high sugar foods. If you skip breakfast, will you eat more at lunch?<br />c.	During dieting, we all believe the ways by cutting calories and skipping the meal will help. But as per the article, most people who lose weight and keep the weight off eat breakfast every day. Do it make you sense to change the eating habit ?<br />d.	The study also showed that kids who ate breakfast had higher test scores than those who didn’t. Kids who skip breakfast are more likely to eat junk food during the day and be overweight. Do you believe it ?<br />The Reading Habits Of Highly Successful People , by Sandra Wu | Dec 22 2016 <br /><br />Some of the world's highest achievers have one thing in common: it isn’t a high IQ, nor is it an incredible lucky streak, but their appreciation for reading. Books were their most profitable investment. <br />From $2 to $20 billion<br />Two teenage boys found employment at a grocery store in Omaha, Nebraska. The older boy, from a poor family devastated by the Great Depression, bred and sold hamsters for spare change. The younger boy, grandson of the store owner, had been delaying college and working odd jobs, like selling chewing gum and coke bottles door to door. Back then, each boy made about $2 a day. Just a few decades later, they’d be raking in $20 billion in profit per year with their conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway. Who were these boys? None other than Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett. How did they become the most successful investors America has ever seen?<br />Buffett spends 80% of his day reading<br />Fastrack to 2007, the 84 year-old Charlie Munger, reveals to a crowd of aspiring law students the secrets to their success: “I constantly see people rise in life who are not the smartest, sometimes not even the most diligent, but they are learning machines. They go to bed every night a little wiser than they were when they got up and boy does that help, particularly when you have a long run ahead of you.” Supposedly, in the early days of Buffett’s investment career, he would read 600-1000 pages in a single day. Nowadays, he still dedicates 80% of his day to reading.His takeaway for everyone: no matter where you are in life, keep on learning and you will succeed. <br />The billionaire book club<br />Buffett and Munger are not the only ones who credit their success to reading. Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk reportedly learned how to build rockets by reading books. Musk was bullied a lot as a child in South Africa. He found comfort in fantasy and science-fiction books, which inspired him to leave a legacy in the world. Bill Gates, the richest man in the world and a lifelong bookworm, reads about 50 books a year, but strictly nonfiction ones. Although he gets to visit a lot of places and meet interesting people, he would still rather read books to acquire new knowledge. Similarly, Mark Zuckerberg invited the whole world to join him on his quest to read a book every two weeks in 2015. So, what are your reading goals? <br />Want to go to bed a little wiser tonight?<br />Although reading is valuable, most people see it as a chore. Why read when you can end the day with your favorite TV show? Or a nice gathering with friends? What if you could get all the benefits of reading without giving up your other interests? You can!  Blinkist is a learning app that transforms the world’s best nonfiction books into 15 minute reads. You can learn about rocket science over breakfast, stock trading over lunch, and the 7 Habits Of Highly Effectively People over dinner. You can also learn on the go with Blinkist audio. This way, you can become a learning machine! <br />Discussions:<br />a.	As a teenager Munger worked at Buffett &amp; Son, a grocery store owned by Warren Buffett's grandfather.In 1959, they began a partnership that has spanned decades and created billions in corporate and personal wealth. Since their fateful meeting, they've built Berkshire Hathaway into one of the world's most successful companies. Buffett is 86 years old, and Munger turns 93, but both them still keep reading. Do you know these famous people ?<br />b.	Do you think , “ Keep reading and you will succeed ? “ Should we also learn from them? <br />c.	In the message, Munger mentioned that “I constantly see people rise in life who are not the smartest, sometimes not even the most diligent, but they are learning machines.?  Do you believe , “書中自有黃金屋 and Knowledge brings wealth?” <br />d.	Do you think that you can get benefits from reading meeting of Royal English Club ? <br />Saturday's meeting place: <br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />tel: 2255-8132<br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
