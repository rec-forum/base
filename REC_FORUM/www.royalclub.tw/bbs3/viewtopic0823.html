This left him to wonder whether Taiwan will truly succeed in achieving its goal in ten years.<br /><br />In a Twitter post that has since been deleted at the request of the school, the ad showed a Caucasian teacher talking to a group of elementary-aged students in a supermarket, with the caption, “English using at the mall, outing with fun we learn more!” <br /><br />Aside from the apparent misuse of the word “mall,” which usually refers to an “indoor shopping center anchored by department stores,” the grammatical errors were also ridiculed by the foreigner who added a “face with tears of joy” emoji to the post.<br /><br />Other members of the foreign community commented below, claiming it was too bad they didn’t ask the foreign teacher to check the content before issuing the ad.<br /><br />Another enthusiastic social media user even dug up the cram school website and added he was not surprised after seeing it “half-blocked because it still uses flash” and reading a poorly constructed opening line on its teacher information page.<br /><br />One commenter jokingly suggested the cram school used translation apps to help with its advertisement and wrote, “Google translate is really bad with mandarin.”<br /><br />Many pointed out other funny attempts to keep up with Taiwan’s “bilingual nation” goals, with one Twitter user referring to Kun Shan International School’s (崑山國際學校) fiasco of misspelling, which saw an “m” instead of “n,” making it “intermational” on its newly erected school sign. <br />Q1. Why do we need to be a bilingual nation?<br />Q2. Can we truly succeed in achieving our goal in ten years?<br />Q3. Do you agree with what the article is saying?<br />Q4. What can we do to improve the education system?<br />Q5. What role can the foreign teacher play in school?<br />Session II: Why do we choose to text instead of talk?<br />BBC Learning English - 6 Minute English / Why do we choose to text instead of talk?<br />Introduction<br />Some people are too busy texting to talk.

This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil.<br />Georgina<br />And I’m Georgina<br />Neil<br />Can I ask you something, Georgina…?<br />Georgina<br />Mm-mm-hmm.<br />Neil<br />Georgina? I said, I want to ask you something… are you listening to me?!<br />Georgina<br />Mm-hmm, just a second, Neil, I’m texting a friend…<br />Neil<br />Ah, has this ever happened you? Someone too busy texting to talk. With the huge rise of mobile phones in recent decades, communicating by text has become more and more popular and scenes like this have become increasingly common.<br />Georgina<br />…and send! There, all done! Now, what were you saying, Neil?<br />Neil<br />In this programme, we’ll be investigating why people often choose to text, instead of talk to the people in their lives. We’ll be asking whether this popular form of communication is changing how we interact with each other.<br />Georgina<br />And, of course, we’ll be learning some related vocabulary as well. Now, Neil, what did you want to ask me?<br />Neil<br />My quiz question, Georgina, which is this. Young people are often the biggest users of mobile phones, but in a 2016 study, what percentage of British teenagers said they would prefer to send a text rather than speak to someone, even if they were in the same room? Is it:<br />a) 9 percent?,<br />b) 49 percent?, or,<br />c) 99 percent?<br />Georgina<br />That sounds pretty shocking! I can’t believe 99 percent of teenagers said that, so I’ll guess b) 49 percent.<br />Neil<br />OK, Georgina. We’ll find out later if that’s right. In one way, the popularity of texting, sometimes called ‘talking with thumbs’, is understandable - people like to be in control of what they say.<br />Georgina<br />But this low-risk way of hiding behind a screen may come at a cost, as neuroscientist, Professor Sophie Scott, explained to Sandra Kanthal, for BBC World Service programme, The Why Factor:<br />Sandra Kanthal<br />When we ‘talk with our thumbs’ by text or email or instant message, we’re often prioritising speed over clarity and depth. But when we can’t hear the way someone is speaking it’s all too easy to misunderstand their intention.<br />Sophie Scott<br />So if I say a phrase like, ‘Oh shut up!’ - has a different meaning than, ‘Oh shut up!’ There’s an emotional thing there but also a strong kind of intonation: one’s sort of funny, one’s just aggressive. Written down it’s just aggressive – ‘Shut up!’ - and you can’t soften that. […] We always speak with melody and intonation to our voice and we’ll change our meaning depending on that. You take that channel of information out of communication you lose another way that sense is being conveyed.<br />Neil<br />When reading a text instead of listening to someone speak, we miss out on the speaker’s intonation – that’s the way the voice rises and falls when speaking.<br />Georgina<br />Intonation, how a word is said, often changes the meaning of words and phrases - small groups of words people use to say something particular.<br />Neil<br />Reading a phrase like, ‘Oh shut up!’ in a text, instead of hearing it spoken aloud, makes it easy to misunderstand the speaker‘s intention – their aim, or plan of what they want to do.<br />Georgina<br />And it’s not just the speaker’s intention that we miss. A whole range of extra information is conveyed through speech, from the speaker’s age and gender to the region they’re from.<br />Neil<br />Poet, Gary Turk, believes that we lose something uniquely human when we stop talking. And there are practical problems involved with texting too, as he explains to BBC World Service’s, The Why Factor:<br />Gary Turk<br />If you speak to someone in person and they don’t respond right away, that would be rude. But you might be speaking to someone in person and someone texts you... and it would be ruder for you then to stop that conversation and speak to the person over text… yet the person on the other side of the text is getting annoyed – you haven’t responded right way – it’s like we’re constantly now creating these situations using our phones that allow us to like tread on mines – no matter what you do, we’re going to disappoint people because we’re trying to communicate in so many different ways. Do you prioritise the person on the phone? Would you prioritise the person you’re speaking to? Who do you disappoint first? You’re going to disappoint somebody.<br />Georgina<br />So what should you do if a friend texts you when you’re already speaking to someone else in person – physically present, face to face?<br />Neil<br />You can’t communicate with both people at the same time, so whatever you do someone will get annoyed – become angry and upset.<br />Georgina<br />Gary thinks that despite its convenience, texting creates situations where we have to tread on mines, another way of saying that something is a minefield, meaning a situation full of hidden problems and dangers, where people need to take care.<br />Neil<br />Yes, it’s easy to get annoyed when someone ignores you to text their friend…<br />Georgina<br />Oh, you’re not still upset about that are you, Neil?<br />Neil<br />Ha, it’s like those teenagers in my quiz question! Remember I asked you how many teenagers said they’d prefer to text someone, even if they were in the same room.<br />Georgina<br />I guessed it was b) 49 percent.<br />Neil<br />Which was… the correct answer! I’m glad you were listening, Georgina, and not texting!<br />Georgina<br />Ha ha! In this programme we’ve been discussing ways in which texting differs from talking with someone in person – or face to face.<br />Neil<br />Sending texts instead of having a conversation means we don’t hear the speaker’s intonation – the musical way their voice rises and falls. A phrase - or small group of words - like ‘Oh shut up!’, means different things when said in different ways.<br />Georgina<br />Without intonation we can easily misunderstand a text writer’s intention – their idea or plan of what they are going to do.<br />Neil<br />Which in turns means they can get annoyed – or become irritated, if you don’t understand what they mean, or don’t respond right away.<br />Georgina<br />All of which can create an absolute minefield – a situation with many hidden problems, where you need to speak and act carefully.<br />Neil<br />And that’s all we have time for in this programme, but remember you can find more useful vocabulary, trending topics and help with your language learning here at BBC Learning English. We also have an app that you can download for free from the app stores and of course we are all over social media. Bye for now!<br /><br />Q1. Is it a trend to Send texts instead of having a conversation?<br />Q2. Would you prefer to send a text rather than speak to someone?<br />Q3. What is the pro &amp; con of texting instead of talking?<br />Q4. In which situations does texting differ from talking with someone in person – or face to face?<br />P.S.<br />1.因聚會地點是在咖啡店內，所以有低消80元喔！<br />2.參加三次後，只要繳交1000元 (學生:500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />3.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~</div>
