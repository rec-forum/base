And they’ve done studies to figure it out. Here are seven traits that researchers have concluded that women find irresistible.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">1.	Good Looks</span><br />Scientists have found that good looks can give you a good head start, but they’re not as important as you think. Studies have shown that women choose better looking guys for short-term flings but not long-term relationships.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">2.	Selflessness</span><br />For Serious Relationships, Studies found that women value selflessness over good looks. Sometimes selflessness is seen as a sign on emotional intelligence. For many of us this one is probably surprising.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><br />3.	George Clooney Effect</span><br />Women may like older men because they’ve had time to accumulate more resources. Researchers call it the “George Clooney Effect“. So according to this, your chances are high if you’re older or generally more “mature looking”. Seems pretty logical.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><br />4.	Sense of Humor</span><br />A sense of humor is important to women, it’s believed to be seen as a sign of intelligence. Humor is also a sign of confidence. Nothing new right?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">5.	Dogs</span><br />Small studies have found that the men with dogs do better with the ladies. Researchers believe it makes them seem nurturing. As weird as it sounds this is just how it is.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">6.	Speed Dating Experiment</span><br />In one speed dating experiment, Women said: they were more attracted to men who were mindful, present, and non-judgmental.”<br />Now who likes judgmental people? I’m pretty sure many people wouldn’t disagree on this point. As for being mindful and present, well those are qualities we all can keep in mind. So next time, be sure to be focused okay?<br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><br />7.	Hero in Action</span><br />Women rate higher who take heroic and sometimes primal risks like saving lives, hunting for food, and playing with fire. Even though this idea is dissed by many people (ehm feminists), it has some strong evidence to support it and from time to time we have seen this to be true.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion questions:</span><br />1.	According to the article above, do you agree with it at all? Which one do you think is the most important quality? ( good looking, a sense of humor, kind, wealthy, animal lover, and heroic) Why?<br />2.	Do you think “playing hard to get could be an effective tactic”?<br />3.	Do you think it’s important to dress well and look good no matter where you are? <br />4.	What are some ways that men can actually impress women? Share your own experience. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Session II</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">My most embarrassing moment</span><br />From Chicken Soup for the Soul<br /><a href="http://www.chickensoup.com/book-story/51715/my-most-embarrassing-moment" class="postlink">http://www.chickensoup.com/book-story/51715/my-most-embarrassing-moment</a><br /><br />1.	Once when I was with my first boyfriend, we decided to go to the movies. I didn’t bring any money with me because I thought that he was paying for me. When he didn’t buy my ticket, I casually asked him to lend me five dollars. He told me that he didn’t bring any more money and he sounded annoyed. I ended up calling my mom and asking her to com and pick me up! We broke up the next week.<br /><br />2.	At school in science class, I was the only girl in a group of all boys working on a project. They started bugging me, trying to find out who I liked. I was really annoying and I finally screamed out, “I love Weston!!!!” Everyone in the whole class heard me. Luckily, my crush was sick at the time.<br /><br />3.	I walked right into a flagpole while walking to the bus at school. I was saying good-bye to my friend and when I turned around, I hit it. Everyone was laughing at me so I started laughing, too. I guess now I should listen when someone says to watch where you’re walking.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion questions:</span><br />1.	We’ve all had embarrassing moments in our life. Please take turns to give a 3-minute presentation about what’s your most embarrassing thing that happened to you.<br />2.	Or you can tell a funny joke.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Agenda</span><br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />8:10 ~ 8:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:25 ~ 8:30pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:30 ~9:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~9:30pm Concluding remarks/feedback from newcomers<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The meeting place of Thursday:</span><br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第一區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
