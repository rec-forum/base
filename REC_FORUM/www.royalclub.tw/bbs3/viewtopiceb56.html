				<div class="content">2/20(Sat.)Find out what your 2021 will be this Year of the Metal Ox/Semiconductors helped make Taiwan Asia’s top-performing economy in 2020(Amy)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Find out what your 2021 will be this Year of the Metal Ox, February 05, 2021 , by Angelica Villanueva</span><br /><br />The year 2020 caught us off guard in different aspects of our lives, affecting our financial stability, careers, business, physical and mental health—with the COVID-19 pandemic raging around the globe. Only a month separates us from a full year since the longest lockdown in the world was imposed back in March of last year.  As we left all our sufferings and pain last year, we also welcome a new chapter in our lives — the year of the Metal Ox. This means there are more things to look forward to this new year. Get to know about your horoscope, predictions, challenges, and what to do to avoid sufferings and negative vibes for the coming year with this Manila Standard Chinese New Year Special interview featuring Feng Shui Master Ang. <br />Here are his tips:<br /><br />YEAR OF THE RAT-    Master Ang shared that people born under the year of the rat suffered a lot in 2020, which was their “supposedly lucky year.” However, the good news for them is that they will be experiencing a better year compared to last year. However, he also advised that they should be more hardworking and persevering when it comes to the workplace. These will help them get back on track from all the losses and challenges from last year.<br /><br />YEAR OF THE OX.  People under the Year of the Ox must be extra careful this year. It, however, doesn’t mean that they will have a comfortable 2021, although working hard and sharing their blessings won’t hurt. “All people born in the Year of the Ox need to be more hardworking, patient, and most importantly, need to help those people in need. Because we believe [in Feng Shui practice] that if you extend some help to others, there will be good karma. So, more on charity,” Master Ang explained.<br /><br />YEAR OF THE TIGER. Blessed—that’s what Master Ang described the people born in the Year of the Tiger. However, he also warned them to become more cautious about their health especially in our situation today. But when asked if this year will be their lucky year, the Feng Shui positively answered with a yes, but only if they will put extra effort into the things they do.<br /><br />YEAR OF THE RABBIT. People under this year will encounter problems in their lives that they have to endure. Master Ang, though, classified two types of people born in the Year of the Rabbit—the strong one and the weak. He advised that those who feel that they are the weak type of rabbit to be tougher this year, full of positivity and be more hardworking.<br /><br />YEAR OF THE DRAGON. The Dragon may be the strongest zodiac sign, but it also has its weaknesses. Master Ang revealed that people born under the Year of the Dragon should be more diligent and patient. He also warned that these people, may easily get mad so they should be more understanding. <br /><br />YEAR OF THE SNAKE. People born under the Year of the Snake should be wary of accidents especially when they are outside. However, they will be stronger and luckier this year.<br /><br />YEAR OF THE HORSE. Master Ang explained that this 2021, people born under the Year of the Horse may still endure sufferings and trials just like last year as it is not compatible with the Ox. What they should do is be more positive, hardworking, and tough to endure all the challenges. Greater blessings, however, await the Year of the Horse in the year 2022.<br /><br />YEAR OF THE GOAT. Just like the previous zodiac sign, the Goat is also considered as the Ox’s mortal enemy. People born under this year will also suffer from trials and should be more mindful of the negative events that await them. They should also be more watchful in terms of their finances and control themselves from buying unnecessary things.<br /><br />YEAR OF THE MONKEY. When it comes to business and career, people born under the Year of the Monkey will be fortunate if they will exert effort and dedication to their craft, and won’t easily give up. Moreover, they will also show aggressiveness this year. Being one of the lucky ones this year, Master Ang advised them to be more helpful to people who are less fortunate. <br /><br />YEAR OF THE ROOSTER. Just like the Tiger, the Rooster will also be blessed this year. But they have to be more hardworking, persevere and be dedicated to what they do so good blessings will come. But, as they work hard, they should also guard their health. <br /><br />YEAR OF THE DOG. The Year of the Dog is also not compatible with Ox this year. But if people will show diligence in their work, bad luck may be avoided. More than that, people born under this year should be also aware of their expenses. They need to do more effort and must not easily give up. <br /><br />YEAR OF THE PIG. The Pig will also experience good luck this year especially with money. What they should do is plan and budget their money wisely. The Year of the Ox will be a good year for them, but must learn how to properly use money. <br /><br />Master Ang also shared that since it will be the Year of the Metal Ox, lucky colors this year will be yellow, white, and grey. Yellow represents gold, white is silver while grey represents metal. Since Ox also gives the element of earth; brown, green, and blue are also considered lucky colors for the year 2021. He also warned that people must be careful of Feng Shui wannabes who sell lucky charms which are contrary to Feng Shui practices. People born under the years of Dog, Horse, Goat, and Dragon must not hang Ox ornaments on their doors as it may bring bad luck to you the whole year. You should also consider the zodiac signs of the people you live with at your house to avoid attracting negative energy. <br />As we welcome a new year in our lives, the Year of the Metal Ox this Chinese New Year, remember that these are just guidelines and reminders. You are still the one who makes your destiny as you make your life choices. You are responsible for your decisions. There’s no lucky nor unlucky year if you persevere and if you always have your faith in God. <br /> <br />Discussions:<br />1.Which zondiac were you born?

It even edged out China for the top spot for the first time in three decades. Besides a hugely successful pandemic response—the nation of 24 million has recorded barely 1,000 cases and eight deaths—that allowed its economy to chug along while others ground to a halt, a significant driver of Taiwan’s economic growth was its semiconductor industry. The country’s statistics office specifically gave shout-outs to the computer chips sector in reporting its advance estimates of economic data last week, crediting “strong demand for parts of electronics products” in propelling the growth of exports. Reporting third-quarter data last November, the office also highlighted the role of semiconductors in driving growth in the manufacturing sector. Globally, sales of semiconductors—tiny electronic devices that power digital devices at the heart of modern industry— rose 6.5% last year, according to US trade group Semiconductor Industry Association. Taiwan, a crucial link in the global semiconductor supply chain, was well-positioned to meet the burgeoning demand. The world’s largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., is headquartered there, where the overwhelming bulk of its manufacturing facilities is located. Last month, TSMC reported record profits, and is expected to spend an eye-popping $28 billion this year on developing chips and expanding plant capacity.<br /> <br />To get a sense of Taiwan’s outsize role in the world economy, just look at its ripple effects on global car production. Recently, some of the world’s largest automakers from Toyota to Volkswagen have had to slow or halt production due to a shortage of chips, which are now used in vehicles for everything from in-car entertainment to parking sensors. Governments and industry executives around the world have already pressed Taiwan to ramp up production to ease the car manufacturing logjam. And in the highest-profile meeting between the Biden administration and their Taipei counterparts yet, high-ranking US officials will this week meet with Taiwan’s economics minister to discuss the auto chips crunch. A key reason behind Taiwan’s dominance in global semiconductors is the structure of its chips industry, argued two researchers in a 2013 paper. In particular, TSMC pioneered the independent chip foundry model, whereby the firm focuses solely on manufacturing chips based on others’ designs. Meanwhile, other Taiwanese semiconductor firms also play highly specialized roles, each focusing on some specific stage in the chips manufacturing process. In doing so, they build leading-edge expertise. Coupled with public policies like government funding, tax benefits, and public infrastructure like the construction of major science and industrial parks, Taiwan created an ecosystem in which the semiconductor industry could flourish and gain international renown.<br />Looming over Taiwan’s semiconductor industry, however, is the great power rivalry between the US and China. With semiconductors underpinning strategic technologies over which Washington and Beijing are battling for dominance, TSMC and Taiwan’s other chip makers inevitably find themselves on a geopolitical tightrope with limited room to maneuver. Already, Taiwanese chipmakers were forced to stop selling to Chinese tech giant Huawei in light of the Trump administration’s restrictions—not a trivial matter given that Huawei was TSMC’s second largest customer in 2019 after Apple. While unenviable, the stuck-in-the-middle position of TSMC—and by extension, Taiwan’s semiconductor industry as a whole—may at least provide some measure of stability, argues Thomas Shattuck, a research associate at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. “While TSMC’s current situation is not ideal, being stuck in the middle of a tech war is perhaps the best, most stable situation available for now,” he wrote in a recent research paper, because neither the US nor China can afford to lose TSMC.<br /> <br />Discussions:<br /> <br />1.TSMC’S EPS is as high as NT$19.98 in 2020. In your investment portfolio, did you own the share of TSMC? If not, are you considering to buy ?<br />2.What’s the key reason that Taiwan can dominate global semiconductors? How important is TSMC to Taiwan and all over the world?<br />3.Can other Taiwan enterprises copy the successful model of TSMC?<br /> <br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00 ~ 7:30 pm greetings &amp; free talk<br />7:30 ~ 8:15 pm guests introduced &amp; first session discussion<br />8:15 ~ 8:45 pm presentation, sharing the article &amp; other experiences<br />8:45 ~ 9:30 pm second session discussion<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven,<br />板橋民生路二段237 號,<br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30,<br /><br />P.S.<br />1.因聚會地點是在咖啡店內，所以有低消80元喔！<br />2.參加三次後，只要繳交1000元 (學生:500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />3.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~</div>
