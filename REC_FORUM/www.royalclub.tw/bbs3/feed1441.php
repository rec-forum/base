And only 17% eat rice for all three meals. Rice consumption in Japan has been falling since the 1960s. According to Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries — or MAFF — Japanese rice consumption peaked in 1962 at around 118 kilograms per person, and has been falling ever since. By 2020, rice consumption was just over 50 kilograms per person — under half the 1962 figure. This trend away from rice seems to have developed from efforts to improve people's diets after World War II. After the war there wasn't enough food in Japan, so the US provided wheat flour that was used to make bread for school lunches. During the 1950s and 1960s, the Japanese government also encouraged people to eat more Western foods such as bread, meat and dairy products, which were seen as more healthy.<br />More recently, an increase in people living alone and in families where both parents are working has led to a change in eating habits. Traditional Japanese family meals with rice take time to prepare, but simple meals with bread or noodles can be prepared very quickly. Now MAFF is trying to reverse this trend by promoting the use of rice in school lunches and providing information on the health benefits of rice. In recent years, the Japanese government has also been promoting rice flour as a healthy, gluten-free alternative to wheat flour, and has been trying to increase rice flour exports abroad. As wheat prices rise because of the weak yen and the war in Ukraine, rice flour could also become more popular in Japan.<br />Discussions:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />1.Are you surprised that only 17% eat rice for three meals in Japan? How often do you eat rice?<br />2.Have you changed your eating habit from rice to Western food? <br /> Do you consider Western food to be healthy?<br />3. How often do you cook at home?

But, it turned out that 25-year-old Luke Pittard actually quite liked his life the way it was. So, not long after winning the fortune, he decided to turn in his luxury life and head back to work at McDonald's. Luke was working as a staff trainer at McDonald's in Pontprennau, Cardiff when he won the colossal stack of cash back in 2006.Not only did he have great mates at the fast food joint, but it's where he met his future wife, Emma Cox. When you win a million pound jackpot, it seems only right to hand in your notice and kick your feet up, so that's what Luke did. During his time away he went in on his new millionaire lifestyle, splashing out on a trip to the Canary Islands, a dream wedding for him and Emma, and a property worth over £200k.But eventually, Luke realised that there was 'more to life than money', and started to miss his pals at McDonald's. So, a year and a half after his big win, Luke decided to return to work.<br />&quot;I loved working at McDonald's before I became a millionaire and I'm really enjoying being back there again,&quot; he told The Sun at the time. &quot;Lots of my old McDonald's workmates came to our wedding and I had kept in touch with them all the time, so I just thought: 'Why not go back?' &quot;He added: &quot;You can only go shopping a certain number of times before you start seeing the same things. It was getting boring and repetitive and I put on a stone in weight. I was eating constantly. &quot;I enjoy going to work. It’s better than staying at home all day. &quot;And Luke has been able to use his winnings to make the working day a little bit easier.&quot;I used to walk to work all the time but now I get a taxi there and back. &quot;If that isn't the high life, I don't know what is. Even though he made more money per week on interest on his lottery winnings than he did in McDonald's, Luke's wife Emma fully supported his decision. &quot;I can totally understand it. We both really enjoyed working at McDonald's and still have good friends there. &quot;So it was really familiar for him and something for him to look forward to.&quot;<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />Discussions:<br />1.If you are the jackpot winner, will you quit your job immediately? Why ?<br />2.How will you distribute your money and what will you do to spend your money?<br />3.According to the statistic in America, the people who win the big jackpot will go bankruptcy with 3-5 years. What do you think the reasons?<br />4.Have you even bought any lottery and what’s your expectation? To try your luckiness or win money to become a millionaire?<br />5.Have your friends or relatives had experienced to win lottery? Share us.<br /></div></blockquote><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12531">Danny Lin</a> — Wed May 10, 2023 9:29 am</p><hr />
