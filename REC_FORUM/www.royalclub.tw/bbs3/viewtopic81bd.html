In searching for solutions, CommonWealth Magazine interviewed 13 prominent figures from academia, the private sector, the government and NGOs to see how they felt about the future for Taiwan. The interviewees envisioned their insight into issues in Taiwan, and they proposed ten propositions for better future for our country. The highlighted issues are so comprehensive that deserves to spend longer time on discussion. For this reason, I decided to separate the ten propositions into two meetings. For meeting on Nov.11,21, we’ll explore the proposition 1 to 5 only. For proposition 6 to 10, I’ll leave them to discover next time. Thank you for your participation, and wish you all enjoy at the occasion. <br /><br />Agenda:<br />7:00-7:05 pm Opening Remarks<br />7:05-7:40 pm Session 1: Group Discussion<br />7:40-8:00 pm Individual Presentation<br />8:00-8:05 pm Break<br />8:05-8:40: Session 2: Group Discussion<br />8:40-9:00 pm Individual Presentation<br /><br />We will hold a hybrid meeting Nov.11 (Thursday):<br /><br />On-site meeting:<br />If you have received at least one dose of vaccine, please join our physical meeting:<br />Dante coffee 丹堤 臺北市大安區濟南路3段25號 忠孝新生MRT Exit 3 or 6<br /><br />On-line meeting:<br />If you haven’t gotten any vaccine or live far away from Taipei, please join our online meeting:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://zoomtw.zoom.us/j/92987266213?pw">https://zoomtw.zoom.us/j/92987266213?pw</a><!-- m --> ... 09#success<br />Meeting ID:929 8726 6213<br />Password:112233<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Article: </span><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://english.cw.com.tw/article/article.action?id=3012">https://english.cw.com.tw/article/artic ... on?id=3012</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal"><span style="color: #0000BF">SESSION ONE QUESTIONS</span></span></span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">1. Proposition 1: </span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #FF0000"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Change the ‘big on production, light on consumption’ mindset</span></span></span><br />In terms of material living standards, efforts should be made to both create and better distribute wealth to reverse the trends of wage stagnation and the widening rich-poor divide.  <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Q1-1. Do you agree with above highlighted issue and solution? Why? Should we put more emphasis on consumption-driven economy model for which probably relies on raising wage level to enhance disposable income , so that we can gain twin-engines for both export and domestic driving economy in Taiwan? <br /><br />Q1-2 Do you think that it’s workable not to suppress the prices for domestic consumption, so that owners on service industry can have higher profits to sustain higher wage? </span></span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">2. Proposition 2: </span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #FF0000"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Promote stakeholder capitalism, create an innovative welfare state</span></span></span><br />To address income inequality, Taiwan should devise a new system for distributing corporate profits and redesign its national welfare system.  <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Q2-1. <span style="text-decoration: underline">Can you distinguish difference between shareholder and stakeholder? What’s your idea to devise a new system for distributing corporate profits and redesign its national welfare system proposed by the interviewee?</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Q2-2 <span style="text-decoration: underline">There is no free lunch actually. Do you think Taiwan should learn from welfare states in Europe? What do you think about the president Xi Jin-Ping of PRC addressed the concept of commonwealth aiming &quot;morally lobbying the rich people to donate more money to charity organization especially founding by government&quot;, so that it can cure uneven wealth distribution issue?</span></span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Q2-3 <span style="text-decoration: underline">It has been for years since the president Tsai Ing-Wen's inauguration that Taiwan government has been conducting a negotiation meeting between labors and owners on wage raising rate every year. Do you think it is an effective way to solve the wage stagnation issue? The interviewee prescribed a prescription, so called &quot;create an innovative welfare state&quot;; do you have any ideas to echo his proposition?</span></span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Proposition 3: </span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #FF0000">Housing should not be an investment vehicle.</span></span></span><br />Taiwan’s housing policy should no longer focus on the idea that everyone should own their own home. Several housing alternatives besides home ownership should be encouraged, including renting, social housing, co-living, or self-builds, so that every individual can find a quality living environment they can afford.<br /><br />Q3.<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Do you think above ideas are great? Will those ideas solve housing issues in Taiwan society?</span></span><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #0000BF"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal">SESSION TWO QUESTIONS:</span></span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Proposition 4: </span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #FF0000">Promote eco-friendly practices, but help with the transition.</span></span></span><br />Environmental quality is one of Taiwan’s major weaknesses.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">In pushing initiatives to save energy and cut carbon emissions or that address the presence of illegal factories on land zoned for agriculture</span>, Taiwan “should not leave behind those groups whose livelihoods would be challenged. It should help them transform their operations and propose directions for reforms,” said Lin Fei-fan (林飛帆), deputy secretary-general of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which currently holds power.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Q4-1.<span style="text-decoration: underline"> For those illegal factories on land zoned for agriculture, what will be the feasible policy to solve this issue? What will be the outcome of the policy better meeting the public benefits?</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Q4-2.<span style="text-decoration: underline">Can you think of any ideas conducive to promote eco-friendly practices, aiming to save energy and cut carbon emissions in Taiwan?</span><br /></span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Proposition 5:  </span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #FF0000">To improve public safety, care for the disadvantaged</span></span></span><br />Chiu Tzu-chen (邱子珍), the head of the Taipei City Police Department’s Juvenile Affairs Division, said<span style="font-weight: bold"> an analysis of police statistics confirmed that broken families are the root cause of many juvenile crimes and that problems faced by mothers are at the root of family problems.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Q5-1.<span style="text-decoration: underline">What is your suggestion for solution to the broken family issues for which are the root cause of many juvenile crimes?</span> <br /><br />Q5-2.<span style="text-decoration: underline">The interviewee proposed a community safety network that can care for and quickly identify people with mental illnesses or drug addictions, or who may be predisposed toward domestic violence or sexual harassment, or who have displayed criminal behavior. Do you think it is an effective solution? Will it be feasible for government to allocate more budget resources to NGO to participate in helping broken families issues?</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Q5-3. <span style="text-decoration: underline">For those persons identified with mental illness which will endanger social safety as the recent event concerning a convenient store female staff attacked by a mentally disorder man. What will be the appropriate approaches to accommodate those people mentally disorder? Especially, for those people with slightly mental disease which did not reach the extent for legal detention to mental care lodging center, should we respect their human right and bear the risk on hurting innocent people as above case occur recently?</span></span></div>
