			<div class="content">12/12(Sat.)Why some people is left-handed?/What happens if you don't drink water?(Host: Jason)<br /><br />Article 1:<br />Why some people is left-handed?<br /><br />Q1:Did you have left-handed friends?<br />Q2:What is the advantages of left-handed people?<br />Q3:What is the disadvantages of left-handed people?<br /><br />If you know an older left-handed person, chances are they had to learn to write or eat with their right hand. And in many parts of the world, it's still common practice to force children to use their &quot;proper&quot; hand. Even the word for right also means correct or good, not just in English, but many other languages, too. But if being left-handed is so wrong, then why does it happen in the first place? Today, about 1/10 of the world's population are left-handed. Archeological evidence shows that it's been that way for as long as 500,000 years, with about 10% of human remains showing the associated differences in arm length and bone density, and some ancient tools and artifacts showing evidence of left-hand use. And despite what many may think,<br />handedness is not a choice. It can be predicted even before birth based on the fetus' position in the womb. So, if handedness is inborn, does that mean it's genetic? Well, yes and no. Identical twins, who have the same genes, can have different dominant hands. In fact, this happens as often as it does with any other sibling pair. But the chances of being right or left-handed are determined by the handedness of your parents in surprisingly consistent ratios. If your father was left-handed but your mother was right-handed, you have a 17% chance of being born left-handed, while two righties will have a left-handed child only 10% of the time. Handedness seems to be determined by a roll of the dice, but the odds are set by your genes. All of this implies there's a reason that evolution has produced this small proportion of lefties, and maintained it over the course of millennia. And while there have been several theories attempting to explain why handedness exists in the first place, or why most people are right-handed, a recent mathematical model suggests that the actual ratio reflects a balance between competitive and cooperative pressures on human evolution. The benefits of being left-handed are clearest in activities involving an opponent, like combat or competitive sports. For example, about 50% of top hitters in baseball have been left-handed.<br />Why? Think of it as a surprise advantage. Because lefties are a minority to begin with, both right-handed and left-handed competitors will spend most of their time encountering and practicing against righties. So when the two face each other, the left-hander will be better prepared against this right-handed opponent, while the righty will be thrown off. This fighting hypothesis, where an imbalance in the population results in an advantage for left-handed fighters or athletes, is an example of negative frequency-dependent selection. But according to the principles of evolution, groups that have a relative advantage tend to grow until that advantage disappears. If people were only fighting and competing throughout human evolution, natural selection would lead to more lefties being the ones that made it until there were so many of them, that it was no longer a rare asset. So in a purely competitive world, 50% of the population would be left-handed. But human evolution has been shaped by cooperation, as well as competition. And cooperative pressure pushes handedness distribution in the opposite direction. In golf, where performance doesn't depend on the opponent, only 4% of top players are left-handed, an example of the wider phenomenon of tool sharing. Just as young potential golfers can more easily find a set of right-handed clubs, many of the important instruments that have shaped society were designed for the right-handed majority. Because lefties are worse at using these tools, and suffer from higher accident rates, they would be less successful<br />in a purely cooperative world, eventually disappearing from the population. So by correctly predicting the distribution of left-handed people in the general population, as well as matching data from various sports, the model indicates that the persistence of lefties as a small but stable minority reflects an equilibrium that comes from competitive and cooperative effects playing out simultaneously over time. And the most intriguing thing is what the numbers can tell us<br />about various populations. From the skewed distribution of pawedness in cooperative animals, to the slightly larger percentage of lefties in competitive hunter-gatherer societies, we may even find that the answers to some puzzles of early human evolution are already in our hands.<br />/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////<br /><br />Article 2:<br /><br />What happens if you don't drink water?<br />Q1:Did you drink water everyday? How much cc did you drink?<br />Q2:What is the advantages of drinking water?<br />Q3:What is the disadvantages of drinking water?<br /><br />Water is virtually everywhere, from soil moisture and ice caps,<br />to the cells inside our own bodies. Depending on factors like location, fat index, age,and sex, the average human is between 55-60% water.At birth, human babies are even wetter. Being 75% water, hey are swimmingly similar to fish. But their water composition drops to 65% by their first birthday.So what role does water play in our bodies, and how much do we actually need to drink to stay healthy?<br />The H20 in our bodies works to cushion and lubricate joints,<br />regulate temperature, and to nourish the brain and spinal cord.<br />Water isn't only in our blood. An adult's brain and heart are almost three quarters water. That's roughly equivalent to the amount of moisture in a banana. Lungs are more similar to an apple at 83%. And even seemingly dry human bones are 31% water. If we are essentially made of water, and surrounded by water, why do we still need to drink so much? Well, each day we lose two to three liters through our sweat, urine, and bowel movements, and even just from breathing. While these functions are essential to our survival, we need to compensate for the fluid loss. Maintaining a balanced water level is essential to avoid dehydration or over-hydration, both of which can have devastating effects on overall health. At first detection of low water levels, sensory receptors in the brain's hypothalamus<br />signal the release of antidiuretic hormone. When it reached the kidneys, it creates aquaporins, special channels that enable blood to absorb and retain more water, leading to concentrated, dark urine. Increased dehydration can cause notable drops in energy, mood, skin moisture, and blood pressure, as well as signs of cognitive impairment. A dehydrated brain works harder <br />to accomplish the same amount as a normal brain, and it even temporarily shrinks because of its lack of water. Over-hydration, or hyponatremia, is usually caused by overconsumption<br />of water in a short amount of time. Athletes are often the victims of over-hydration because of complications in regulating water levels in extreme physical conditions. Whereas the dehydrated brain amps up the production of antidiuretic hormone, the over-hydrated brain slows, or even stops, releasing it into the blood. Sodium electrolytes in the body<br />become diluted, causing cells to swell. In severe cases, the kidneys can't keep up with the resulting volumes of dilute urine.<br />Water intoxication then occurs, possibly causing headache,<br />vomiting, and, in rare instances, seizures or death. But that's a pretty extreme situation. On a normal, day-to-day basis,<br /><br />maintaining a well-hydrated system is easy to manage<br />for those of us fortunate enough to have access to clean drinking water.For a long time, conventional wisdom said<br />that we should drink eight glasses a day. That estimate has since been fine-tuned.Now, the consensus is that the amount of water we need to imbibe depends largely on our weight<br />and environment. The recommended daily intake varies from<br />between 2.5-3.7 liters of water for men, and about 2-2.7 liters for women, a range that is pushed up or down if we are healthy, active, old, or overheating. While water is the healthiest hydrator, other beverages, even those with caffeine <br />like coffee or tea, replenish fluids as well. And water within food makes up about a fifth of our daily H20 intake. Fruits and vegetables like strawberries, cucumbers, and even broccoli are over 90% water, and can supplement liquid intake while<br />providing valuable nutrients and fiber. Drinking well might also have various long-term benefits. Studies have shown that optimal hydration can lower the chance of stroke, help manage diabetes, and potentially reduce the risk of certain types of cancer.No matter what, getting the right amount of liquid makes a world of difference in how you'll feel, think, and function day to day.<br /><br />///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////<br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00 ~ 7:30 pm greetings &amp; free talk<br />7:30 ~ 8:15 pm guests introduced &amp; first session discussion<br />8:15 ~ 8:45 pm presentation, sharing the article &amp; other experiences<br />8:45 ~ 9:30 pm second session discussion<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven,<br />板橋民生路二段237 號,<br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30,<br />a minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
