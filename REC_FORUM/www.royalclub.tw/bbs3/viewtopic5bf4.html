What are your thoughts on Miss Korea being called &quot;Too Fat &quot; ?<br />2. Why do some South Koreans think it's normal to tell people they're overweight ? <br />3. Have you ever analyze when ones tell another one that he/she is overweight and should go on diet ? <br />4. Why fat shaming is so common in <br />South Korea ? <br />5. If fat shaming is so ineffective , how come it seems to work well in countries like Japan, Taiwan and South Korea ? <br /><br />Second session is Table Topic.<br />Each of the participants prepare some questions. <br />In the first round the first person ask the question and any participants can answer it. Every participant have the chance to raise the question and answer the participant's question later.<br />In the second round I would like to invite the volunteer to ask  or answer the question. If there is no volunteer I will assign the speaker.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />P.S.<br />1.因疫情關係，聚會方式改為線上遠距。<br />2.參加三次後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />3.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~</div>
