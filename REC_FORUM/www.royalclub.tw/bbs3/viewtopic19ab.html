Have you ever seen puppet show? What impressed you?<br />2.	Do you agree we can learn something from those virtual roles? Why?<br />3.	In the future, do you think puppet show can become the lesson? How can it benefit us?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Session II</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How an allowance helps us learn about money</span><br /><br />When we are children, we must have had allowance, from which we began to learn the value of money. The goal is to learn even if make a financial mistake, you won’t pay high price.<br /><br />The amount of money that parents give to their children to spend as they wish differs from family to family. Timing is another consideration. Some children get a weekly allowance. Others get a monthly allowance.<br /><br />Saving helps us understand that costly goals require sacrifice: you have to cut costs and plan for the future.<br />Although investment is risky, it can also accumulate wealth slowly. When money is used, there is no shortage of funds available.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />1.	When you get the allowance, how do you want to use it?<br />2.	What is the idea for investment and what are the benefits of financial planning?<br />3.	Are you satisfied with your current financial plan? If you are not satisfied, what are the good ways to do it?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Agenda</span><br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />8:10 ~ 8:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:25 ~ 8:30pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:30 ~9:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~9:30pm Concluding remarks/feedback from newcomers<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0040">The meeting place of Thursday:<br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第一區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文<br /></span></div>
