<br />•  (Laughter) <br />•  Now, if you had to guess, <br />•  how old would you say you were when you were first asked this question? <br />•  You can just hold up fingers. <br />•  Three, five, three, five, five; OK. <br />•  Now, raise your hand if the question <br />•  &quot;What do you want to be when you grow up?&quot; has ever caused you any anxiety. <br />•  (Laughter) <br />•  Any anxiety at all. <br />•  I'm someone who's never been able to answer the question, <br />•  &quot;What do you want to be when you grow up?&quot; <br />•  See, the problem wasn't that I didn't have any interests <br />•  it's that I had too many. <br />•  In high school I liked English, and Math, and Arts, and I built websites, <br />•  and I played guitar in a punk band called Frustrated Telephone Operator. <br />•  (Laughter) <br />•  Maybe you've heard of us. <br />•  (Laughter) <br />•  This continued after high school, <br />•  and at a certain point, I began to notice this pattern in myself, <br />•  where I would become interested in an area <br />•  and I would dive in, and become all consumed, <br />•  and I'd get to be pretty good at whatever it was, <br />•  and then I would hit this point where I'd start to get bored. <br />•  And usually, I would try and persist anyway <br />•  because I'd already devoted so much time and energy, <br />•  and sometimes money into this field. <br />•  But eventually, this sense of boredom, this feeling of, &quot;Yeah, I've got this! <br />•  This isn't challenging anymore,&quot; <br />•  it would get to be too much, and I would have to let it go. <br />•  But then, I would become interested in something else, <br />•  something totally unrelated, <br />•  and I would dive into that and become all consumed, <br />•  and I would feel like, &quot;Yes, I found my thing!&quot; <br />•  And then I would hit this point again <br />•  where I'd start to get bored and eventually I would let it go. <br />•  But then I would discover something new and totally different, <br />•  and I would dive into that... <br />•  This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety for two reasons: <br />•  the first was that I wasn't sure <br />•  how I was going to turn any of this into a career. <br />•  I thought that I would eventually have to pick one thing, <br />•  deny all my other passions and just resign myself to being bored. <br />•  The other reason it caused me so much anxiety <br />•  was a little bit more personal. <br />•  I worried that there was something wrong with this <br />•  and something wrong with me <br />•  for being unable to stick with anything. <br />•  I worried that I was afraid of commitment, or that I was scattered, <br />•  or that I was self sabotaging, afraid of my own success. <br />•  If you can relate to my story and to these feelings, <br />•  I'd like you to ask yourself a question that I wish I had asked myself back then. <br />•  Ask yourself where you learned <br />•  to assign the meaning of wrong or abnormal to doing many things. <br />•  I'll tell you where you learnt it. <br />•  You learnt it from the culture. <br />•  When you were first asked the question, <br />•  &quot;What do you want to be when you grow up?&quot; <br />•  you were about five years old, <br />•  and the truth is that no one really cares what you say when you are that age. <br />•  (Laughter) <br />•  It's considered an innocuous question <br />•  posed to little kids to elicit cute replies. <br />•  Like, &quot;I want to be an astronaut,&quot; or &quot;I want to be a ballerina,&quot; <br />•  or &quot;I want to be a pirate,&quot; - insert Halloween costume here. <br />•  (Laughter) <br />•  But this question is asked of us again and again <br />•  as we get older in various forms. <br />•  For instance, <br />•  high school students might get asked <br />•  what major they are going to pick in college. <br />•  And at some point, what do you want to be when you grow up <br />•  goes from being the cute exercise it once was <br />•  to the thing that keeps us up at night. <br />•  Why? <br />•  See, while this question inspires kids to dream about what they could be, <br />•  it does not inspire them to dream about all that they could be. <br />•  In fact, it does just the opposite. <br />•  Because when someone asks you what you want to be, <br />•  you can't reply with 20 different things. <br />•  The well meaning adult will likely chuckle and be like, <br />•  &quot;Oh, how cute, but you can't be a violin maker and a psychologist. <br />•  You have to choose.&quot; <br />•  This is Doctor Bob Childs. <br />•  (Laughter) <br />•  And he's a luthier and a psychotherapist. <br />•  And this is Amy Ng, a magazine editor, <br />•  turned illustrator, entrepreneur, teacher, and creative director. <br />•  But most kids don't hear about people like this. <br />•  All they hear is that they are going to have to choose. <br />•  But it's more than that. <br />•  The notion of the narrowly focused life is highly romanticized in our culture. <br />•  It's this idea of destiny or the one true calling. <br />•  The idea that we each have one great thing <br />•  we are meant to do during our time on this Earth. <br />•  And you need to figure out <br />•  what that thing is and devote your life to it. <br />•  But, what if you are someone who isn't wired this way? <br />•  What if there are a lot of different subjects <br />•  that you're curious about? <br />•  And many different things you want to do? <br />•  Well, there is no room for someone like you in this framework. <br />•  And so you might feel alone. <br />•  You might feel like you don't have a purpose. <br />•  You might feel like there is something wrong with you. <br />•  There is nothing wrong with you. <br />•  What you are is a multipotentialite. <br />•  (Applause) <br />•  A multipotentialite is someone <br />•  with many interests and creative pursuits. <br />•  It's a mouthful to say. <br />•  It might help if you break it up into three parts: <br />•  multi - potential - ite. <br />•  You can also use one of the other terms that connote the same ideas, <br />•  such is the polymath, the Renaissance person. <br />•  Actually, during the Renaissance period <br />•  it was considered the ideal to be well versed in multiple disciplines. <br />•  Barbara Sher refers to us as scanners. <br />•  Use whichever term you like or invent your own. <br />•  I have to say I find it sort of fitting that as a community, <br />•  we cannot agree on a single identity. <br />•  (Laughter) <br />•  It's easy to see your multipotentiality <br />•  as a limitation or an affliction that you need to overcome. <br />•  But what I've learned through speaking with people <br />•  and writing about these ideas on my website, Puttylike, <br />•  is that there is some tremendous strengths to being this way. <br />•  Here are 3 multipotentialite super powers. <br />•  One; idea synthesis. <br />•  That is combining two or more fields <br />•  and creating something new at the intersection. <br />•  Sha Hwang and Rachel Binx drew from their shared interest in cartography, <br />•  data visualization, travel, mathematics, and design when they founded Meshu. <br />•  Meshu is a company that creates custom geographically inspired jewelry. <br />•  Sha and Rachel came up with this unique idea <br />•  not despite, but because of their eclectic mix <br />•  of skills and experiences. <br />•  Innovation happens at the intersections. <br />•  That's where the new ideas come from. <br />•  And multipotentialites with all of their backgrounds <br />•  are able to access a lot of these points of intersection. <br />•  The second multipotentialite superpower is rapid learning. <br />•  When multipotentialites become interested in something - we go hard. <br />•  We absorb everything we can get our hands on. <br />•  We're also used to being beginners <br />•  because we've been beginners so many times in the past. <br />•  And this means that we're less afraid of trying new things <br />•  and stepping out of our comfort zones. <br />•  What's more, many skills are transferable across disciplines. <br />•  And we bring everything we've learned to every new area we pursue <br />•  so we're rarely starting from scratch. <br />•  Nora Dunn is a full time traveler and freelance writer. <br />•  As a child concert pianist, <br />•  she honed an incredible ability to develop muscle memory. <br />•  Now she's the fastest typist she knows. <br />•  Before becoming a writer, Nora was a financial planner. <br />•  She had to learn the finer mechanics of sales <br />•  when she was starting her practice, <br />•  and this skill now helps her write compelling pitches to editors. <br />•  It is rarely a waste of time to pursue something you are drawn to, <br />•  even if you end up quitting. <br />•  You might apply that knowledge in a different field entirely <br />•  in a way you couldn't have anticipated. <br />•  The third multipotentialite super power is adaptability. <br />•  That is the ability to morph <br />•  into whatever you need to be in a given situation. <br />•  Abe Cajudo is sometimes a video director, sometimes a web designer, <br />•  sometimes a Kickstarter consultant, sometimes a teacher, <br />•  and sometimes, apparently, James Bond. <br />•  (Laughter) <br />•  He's valuable because he does good work. <br />•  He's even more valuable <br />•  because he can take on various roles depending on his client's needs. <br />•  Fast Company Magazine identified adaptability <br />•  as the single most important skill to develop <br />•  in order to thrive in the 21st century. <br />•  The economic world is changing so quickly and unpredictably <br />•  that it is the individuals and organizations that can pivot <br />•  in order to meet the needs of the market that are really going to thrive. <br />•  Idea synthesis, rapid learning and adaptability. <br />•  Three skills that multipotentialites are very adept at. <br />•  And three skills that they might lose if pressured to narrow their focus. <br />•  As a society, we have a vested interest <br />•  in encouraging multipotentialites to be themselves. <br />•  We have a lot of complex, multidimensional problems in the world right now, <br />•  and we need creative, out-of-the-box thinkers to tackle them. <br />•  Now, let's say that you are in your heart a specialist. <br />•  You came out of the womb <br />•  knowing you wanted to be a pediatric neurosurgeon. <br />•  Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either. <br />•  (Laughter) <br />•  In fact, some of the best teams <br />•  are comprised of a specialist and a multipotentialite paired together. <br />•  A specialist can dive-in deep and implement ideas <br />•  while the multipotentialite brings a breadth of knowledge to the project. <br />•  It's a beautiful partnership. <br />•  But we should all be designing lives and careers <br />•  that are aligned with how we are wired, <br />•  and sadly, multipotentialites are largely being encouraged <br />•  simply to be more like their specialist peers. <br />•  So, with that said; <br />•  if there's one thing you take away from this talk, <br />•  I hope that it is this: <br />•  embrace your inner wiring whatever that may be. <br />•  If you are a specialist at heart, then by all means, specialize. <br />•  That is where you'll do your best work. <br />•  But, to the multipotentialites in the room <br />•  - including those of you who may have just realized <br />•  in the last 12 minutes that you are one - <br />•  (Laughter) <br />•  to you I say: embrace your many passions, <br />•  follow your curiosity down those rabbit holes, <br />•  explore your intersections. <br />•  Embracing our inner wiring leads to a happier, more authentic life <br />•  and perhaps more importantly, <br />•  multipotentialites, <br />•  the world needs us. <br />•  Thank you. <br />•  (Applause)<br /><br />Questions:<br />1. What is a specialist and what is a multipotentialite? <br />2. Are you a specialist or a multipotentialite? Which one would you rather be?<br />3. “A rolling stone gathers no moss”—what revelation does this jargon reflect against multi-talent? <br />4. In your childhood or in your school days, what did you want to be when grown up? What was your life aspiration? What eventually are you?
