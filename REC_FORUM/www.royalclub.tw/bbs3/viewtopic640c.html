			<div class="content">Elon Musk Thinks Governments Should Study Artificial Intelligence<br />Kirsten Korosec  Aug 05, 2017<br />SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has added a dose of pragmatism to his typically dire thoughts about the risks of artificial intelligence to humankind.<br />The billionaire's views on the risks of artificial intelligence are well-documented over here at Fortune and elsewhere. But last month when he described artificial intelligence as “the greatest risk we face as a civilization” at the National Governor's Association, the reaction sparked criticism from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg as well as other tech magnates and roboticists.<br />Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.<br />Musk fired back via Twitter describing the Zuckerberg's understanding of the subject as &quot;limited&quot; in a terse tweet.<br />During Tesla's earnings call on Wednesday, Musk tried to dial things back a bit and explain what he believes is the government's role and responsibility.<br />Here are his entire comments about AI:<br />It's just something that I think, anything that represents—that is a risk to the public deserves at least insight from the government because one of the mandates of the government is the public well-being. And that insight is different from oversight, so at least the government should have insight to understand what's going on, and then decide what rules are appropriate to ensure public safety.<br />That is what I'm advocating for. I'm not advocating for that we stop the development of AI, or any of the sort of straw man, hyperbole things that have been written. I do think there are great benefits to AI. We just need to make sure that they're indeed benefits, and we don't do something really dumb.<br />No word on how Musk will encourage government to take up this charge. Perhaps the governors who heard him speak have already been prompted to take action.<br />Elon Musk says AI ‘vastly more risky than North Korea’<br />Tesla head warns of dangers of AI and pushes for regulation as OpenAI he backed beats best human players in online DotA 2 championship<br />Elon Musk has warned again about the dangers of artificial intelligence, saying that it poses “vastly more risk” than the apparent nuclear capabilities of North Korea does.<br />The Tesla and SpaceX chief executive took to Twitter to once again reiterate the need for concern around the development of AI, following the victory of Musk-led AI development over professional players of the Dota 2 online multiplayer battle game.<br />This is not the first time Musk has stated that AI could potentially be one of the most dangerous international developments. He said in October 2014 that he considered it humanity’s “biggest existential threat”, a view he has repeated several times while making investments in AI startups and organisations, including OpenAI, to “keep an eye on what’s going on”.<br />Musk again called for regulation, previously doing so directly to US governors at their annual national meeting in Providence, Rhode Island.<br />Musk’s tweets coincide with the testing of an AI designed by OpenAI to play the multiplayer online battle arena (Moba) game Dota 2, which successfully managed to win all its 1-v-1 games at the International Dota 2 championships against many of the world’s best players competing for a $24.8m (£19m) prize fund.<br />The AI displayed the ability to predict where human players would deploy forces and improvise on the spot, in a game where sheer speed of operation does not correlate with victory, meaning the AI was simply better, not just faster than the best human players.<br />Musk backed the non-profit AI research company OpenAI in December 2015, taking up a co-chair position. OpenAI’s goal is to develop AI “in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return”. But it is not the first group to take on human players in a gaming scenario. Google’s Deepmind AI outfit, in which Musk was an early investor, beat the world’s best players in the board game Go and has its sights set on conquering the real-time strategy game StarCraft II.<br />Musk’s latest comments come after a public spat with Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg over the dangers of AI, with Musk dismissing Zuckerberg as having “limited” understanding of the subject after the social network’s head called out Musk for scaremongering over AI.<br /><br />Q1: According to your understanding, what is “AI”?<br />Q2: Are AI computers taking our job? Why?<br />Q3: Do you think AI still needs to be developed if it can “think “? Why?<br />Q4: If a robot can do anything, what will you expect it to do for you?<br /><br />Dubai To Put Autonomous Taxi Drones In The Skies 'This Summer' Feb 14, 2017<br />I cover agitators and innovators in mobile. <br /><br />A model of EHang 184 and the next generation of Dubai Drone Taxi is seen during the second day of the World Government Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Monday, Feb. 13, 2017. (AP Photo/Jon Gambrell)<br />When the ruling family decrees that a quarter of all journeys in a city state will be autonomous by 2030, someone somewhere is obliged to make that start happening as soon as possible.<br />In Dubai, that person is Mattar Al Tayer, chairman of the city’s Road and Transport Authority. He said Monday that he hopes Dubai will have autonomous taxi drones zipping around its skyline this summer. Actual drones that people can sit inside without fearing for their lives.<br />The flying taxis are being manufactured by Chinese drone-making firm EHang and can carry a person weighing up to 100 kilograms (about 220 pounds) along with a small suitcase. Passengers don’t need to learn how to fly the drones, EHang's co-founder Derrick Xiong told FORBES staff writer Aaron Tilley in an interview this time last year.<br />“They just need to press a button and then it vertically takes off, flies from point A to point B, and lands.”<br />The drones have a range of 30 kilometers (19 miles), flying at around 60 miles per hour, and are “on track to take off within months,” Al Tayer said.<br />“I am glad to inform you that hopefully we will be able to have these drones available, starting July 2017,&quot; he added at the World Government Summit, a gathering of tech and government leaders at Dubai.<br />That “hopefully” from Al Tayer is an important hedge to make for a product that, it appears, has not yet officially taken flight with paying customers anywhere else in the world.<br />In fact when EHang unveiled its drone taxi at the Consumer Electronics Show a year ago in January 2016, its “demo video” of the autonomous vehicle soaring over snowcapped mountains and the San Francisco skyline turned out to be computer generated.<br />FORBES writer Ryan Mac noted then that EHang was one of several drone companies who had overhyped their ability to commercialize a futuristic product.<br />The latest video of the EHang 184 (above) which was shown in Dubai this week, shows a well-groomed business executive putting a briefcase into the drone and then folding himself into the sports-car like interior. Notably, the video doesn’t show him in the drone when it flies up towards the clouds.<br />EHang, based in Guangzhou, China and with offices in San Carlos, Calif., has raised some $53 million to date according to PitchBook data, and its investors include GGV Capital and Golden Partners Capital. It’s website, <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ghost-drone.com/">www.ghost-drone.com</a><!-- w -->, did not appear to be accessible on Tuesday.<br />The EHang 184 is part of a wider initiative that Dubai’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, announced in April 2016: that he wanted 25% of all passenger journeys in Dubai to be carried out in autonomous vehicles by 2030.<br />Since then, the city’s officials has struck a deal with Hyperloop One to study the possibility of building a hyperloop line that connects Dubai to Abu Dhabi. In September 2016 a driverless shuttle called the EZ10, made by French company EasyMile, began running a 700-meter trial route on Mohammed Bin Rashid Boulevard.<br /><br />Q1: If those flying taxis are available, do you dare to give it a try?<br />Q2: What is the advantage /disadvantage of using drone taxi?<br />Q3: What is the most adventurous thing you have ever done?<br /><br />Saturday's meeting place: <br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />tel: 2255-8132<br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
