			<div class="content">British wedding traditions you should know before Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's royal wedding<br />By JULIA MACFARLANE via GMA LONDON — May 19, 2018<br />Every culture has its own unique set of traditions for the big day and the Brits are no exception.<br />Britain's royal family exemplifies tradition and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s May 19 wedding will be the wedding of the year, filled with some well-known and some not so well-known British customs.<br />Here are a few aspects of a traditional British wedding experience that differ from standard practice in the U.S.<br />British wedding traditions<br />Bachelor and bachelorette parties have different names<br />In the U.K. a bachelor party is known as a &quot;stag do,&quot; and a bachelorette party is called a &quot;hen do&quot; or hen party. Both are usually held over an entire weekend -- sometimes even longer. Kate Middleton’s hen do was top secret, but for her sister Pippa Middleton's hen do, the duchess of Cambridge reportedly took part in a weekend of skiing in the Alps.<br />Wedding breakfasts<br />Instead of a Saturday night formal affair, many British weddings are usually held in the morning, with the first meal that follows often called &quot;wedding breakfast&quot; - though it may be a lunch or a dinner.<br />Prince Harry and Markle's wedding will begin at noon local time, or 7 a.m. ET, at St. George’s Chapel on the grounds of Windsor Castle. After the carriage procession, the newlyweds will attend a reception where they will rejoin their wedding guests. Harry and Markle are expected to continue celebrating their marriage at an evening reception hosted by Harry's father, Prince Charles, for close friends and family, which is not open to the public.<br />Hats for the ladies!<br />British women have serious hat game.<br />It's common tradition for all women attending a British wedding to accessorize their dress with a hat or a fascinator, a decorative headdress in place of a hat. They'll be worn throughout the entire ceremony and usually for an afternoon reception, but will be taken off during dinner or in the evenings.<br />Morning suits for the gents<br />In many British weddings, the men traditionally sport morning suits instead of a tuxedo. A morning suit is traditional British daytime formal dress consisting of a three-piece suit including a morning coat with tails, a waistcoat and trousers.<br />Only men tend to make speeches at dinner<br />The father of the bride, the best man and the groom are typically the ones to give speeches at a British wedding, not the maid of honor. The whole point of the speeches is usually to embarrass the newlyweds as much as possible.<br />Here comes the bride ... first<br />The big reveal you often see in Hollywood films where the bride finally emerges last in the procession doesn't happen in the U.K. The bride typically walks down the aisle first –- and her bridesmaids will walk behind her, usually to hold the train of the dress.<br />Royal family wedding traditions<br />There is always myrtle in the bride's bouquet -- a tradition dating back to Queen Victoria. It's believed that a spring of myrtle in all royal bridal bouquets are cut from the same myrtle shrub that grows in Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, a favorite retreat of Queen Victoria's.<br />Wedding bands contain Welsh gold<br />All royal wedding bands typically contain Welsh gold – a tradition beginning in 1923 with the Queen Mother. Welsh gold is so rare it can be valued up to 30 times more than standard gold. Welsh gold has a history of more than 2,000 years since the time of the Romans.<br />The wedding cake is typically made of fruit	<br />While there are no hard and fast rules on wedding cake, most British weddings have fruitcake. Prince William and Princess Kate served two cakes on their wedding day in 2011, a traditional eight-tier fruit cake created by chef Fiona Cairns and a chocolate biscuit cake from a Buckingham Palace recipe that was a favorite of William's as a child and also enjoyed by Queen Elizabeth.<br />Some couples even opt for pork pie wedding cakes.<br />Harry, 33, and Markle, 36, have broken with tradition in this regard, commissioning pastry chef Claire Ptak of London's Violet Bakery to create a lemon elderflower cake with buttercream icing and fresh flowers as decorations, according to Kensington Palace.<br />The Royal Marriages Act 1772 is repealed -- but there are still rules<br />The British government repealed legislation that previously dictated certain terms over royal marriages. With the Succession of the Crown Act of 2013, certain restrictions were changed, such as not allowing gender to decide the hierarchy of the throne. (Princess Charlotte, for example, will not be pushed further down the line of succession if the Kate's next child is a boy).<br />Some rules, however, remain. According to the Succession to the Crown Act of 2013, the first six people in line to the throne must obtain the consent of the queen before marrying.<br />The queen gave her consent for Harry and Markle's marriage on March 14. The consent is announced and marked with a letter to the Privy Council, the group of advisers to the Sovereign. Heirs to the throne may also marry a Roman Catholic – something previously not allowed. However, Roman Catholics currently cannot ascend to the throne themselves as the monarch is the head of the Church of England.<br />--<br />1.

You’ve realized experiences are more important than possessions and you’ve put together a plan to start saving for your next big trip.<br />But how are you going to decide where to actually go?<br />Budget and time will undoubtedly play a part in the decision making process but with so many amazing places in the world, how do you whittle it down?<br />If you’re anything like me, you’ll just want to go EVERYWHERE and explore as much of the world as possible! But unless you’re taking a few years out to travel, this really isn’t an option. While some people want to go everywhere, other people don’t have one place on their wish list and they’re not sure how to discover new places to go.<br />Whichever situation you’re in, here are my top tips to help you choose your travel destinations.<br /><br />First of all, let’s start with some questions:<br />•	City, beach or countryside?<br />•	Hot or cold weather?<br />•	Adventure or relaxation?<br />•	Shopping, culture or adrenaline?<br />•	Family, friends or boyfriend/girlfriend? Or maybe solo?<br />•	Independent travel or have everything organized for you?<br />•	Budget or splash the cash? Or somewhere in the middle?<br />•	Off the beaten track or a tried and tested destination?<br />We’ve starting thinking about what kind of holiday you’re after, so it’s easier to pin-point the kind of destination you’d like.<br />Now it’s time to get in the right frame of mind…10 tips when choosing your destination<br />#1. Be open-minded<br />Haven’t heard a place? Can’t even pronounce a place? Have no idea where a place is? But you’ve found suspiciously cheap flights to said place…? Google the hell out of it, check its safe and book that flight! Sometimes you’ll have the best adventures in places you can’t pronounce. Ljubljana, I’m talking to you.<br />#2. Be creative<br />You want to travel to a certain destination but flights are really expensive? Don’t let this put you off, find an alternative. Using the example of Ljubljana again, it’s really expensive to fly direct but flights to Venice are cheap and then there’s a 2 hour shuttle bus from Venice into Ljubljana. Problem solved.<br />#3. Consider the underdog<br />Every country has a ‘second city’ and it’s often a much cheaper and a more unique alternative to the capital city.<br />#4. Be decisive<br />You’ve found a place you want to go. Book it now. Go on, book it. Don’t think about it for 3 weeks and then think a bit more and then realize you’ve missed the opportunity.<br />#5. Ask yourself ‘why’?<br />Why do you want to travel? Do you want to relax, have fun with your mates, reconnect with a loved one, switch off from work, learn something new, get a tan or have an adventure? It’s easier to decide where you’re going when you know why you’re going there.<br />#6. Remember, remember…<br />You’ll only regret the things you didn’t do.<br />I always think about this when I need a kick up the arse to be a little more adventurous.<br />#7. Safe choices aren’t bad choices<br />Yes, I like to be adventurous in my travel choices but a good old weekend in Paris or an all-inclusive beach holiday should never been sneered at. So what if a million people have done it before you. If you have a good time, that’s all that matters.<br />#8. Go Solo<br />You’ve found somewhere you REALLY want to go but no one wants to go with you? Don’t let this stop you, go solo!<br />#9. Don’t dismiss your own backyard<br />Who said travelling has to include long flights? Search a little closer to home, you’d be surprised by the hidden gems you might find.<br />#10. There’s always a budget option<br />Don’t let your budget stop you from travelling somewhere. Even the most expensive countries have budget options like hostels where you can cook your own food, free city tours and public transport. You’re going to need to be creative but that often makes it more fun.<br />--<br />1.	Are you a traveling lover? Which country you’d like to go or which county you will suggest us to go? And why?<br />2.	Have you ever plan a trip to somewhere that you want to go there again? Would you please share with everyone? <br />3.	What do you take into consideration when you plan your trip? <br />4.	Which city you haven’t go but would like to visit? And WHY?<br />5.	There are 10 tips in this article, which you think is quite important during trip planning? And any missing you want to add in?<br /><br />Saturday's meeting place:<br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />tel: 2255-8132<br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
