				<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Session I: Which of These 3 Types of Minds Do You Have? </span><br />Jonathan Malm - February 9, 2017 <br /><a href="http:// www.jonathanmalm.com/which-of-these-3-types-of-minds-do-you-have/" class="postlink">http://%20www.jonathanmalm.com/which-of-these-3-types-of-minds-do-you-have/</a><br /><br />“Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people.” That’s a quote attributed to Eleanor Roosevelt. I’d encourage you to analyze your social media usage and see which type of mind you are. I’ll go in reverse order.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">1.	Small Minds that Discuss People</span><br />Are most of your social media posts outrage over what someone did? Maybe a political candidate? An inflammatory pastor?<br /><br />The reason this type of conversation comes from small minded people is that they are always reacting to other people. They don’t create anything new, they just respond to what other people are doing. This often results in feelings of helplessness – feeling like you’re at the mercy of other people’s action.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">2.	Average Minds that Discuss Events</span><br />Are all of your posts about the latest football game? The latest TV show? I applaud you that most of your conversations aren’t about criticism. But if all you’re talking about is what you enjoyed or didn’t enjoy, you’re merely talking about entertainment. Or if you’re just talking about what already happened, you can’t contribute anything to a hopeful future.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">3.	Great Minds that Discuss Ideas</span><br />This is where I wish more people lived. Want to talk about the refugee crisis? Offer some ideas. Want to criticize something political? Come up with an idea outside of the realm of politics.<br /><br />Ideas cut to the heart of the matter. They offer hope for the future. They take a pro-active approach to the world.<br />Again, analyze your everyday conversations. Look at your social media feed. What kind of “mind” do those interactions indicate you have?<br /><br />You have the capacity to think great thoughts and do great things. You just need to change your perspective on your conversations.<br />This is a challenge for me. I’m going to work to be more of a great mind. How about you?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion Questions:</span><br />1.	Which of these three types of minds do you have? How does it influence you?<br />2.	If people who ignore whatever they see and hear and regard it as nothing, what kind of mindset do they have? <br />3.	Please share great thoughts and great things that you have ever engaged?<br />4.	Do you often use average minds in daily life? Why?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Session II: With rising sea levels, Bangkok struggles to stay afloat</span><br />September 02, 2018<br /><a href="http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/national/30353543" class="postlink">http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/national/30353543</a><br /><br />As Bangkok prepares to host climate-change talks, the sprawling city of more than 10 million is itself under siege from the environment, with dire forecasts warning it could be partially submerged in just over a decade. <br /><br />A preparatory meeting begins Tuesday in Thailand's capital for the next UN climate conference, a crunch summit in Poland at the end of 2018 to set rules on reducing greenhouse emissions and providing aid to vulnerable countries.<br /><br /> As temperatures rise, abnormal weather patterns -- like more powerful cyclones, erratic rainfall, and intense droughts and floods -- are predicted to worsen over time, adding pressure on governments tasked with bringing the 2015 Paris climate treaty to life.<br /><br /> Bangkok, built on once-marshy land about 1.5 metres (five feet) above sea level, is projected to be one of the world's hardest hit urban areas, alongside fellow Southeast Asian behemoths Jakarta and Manila.<br /><br /> &quot;Nearly 40 percent&quot; of Bangkok will be inundated by as early as 2030 due to extreme rainfall and changes in weather patterns, according to a World Bank report.<br /><br />Currently, the capital &quot;is sinking one to two centimetres a year and there is a risk of massive flooding in the near future,&quot; said Tara Buakamsri of Greenpeace.<br /><br />Seas in the nearby Gulf of Thailand are rising by four millimetres a year, above the global average.<br /><br />The city &quot;is already largely under sea level&quot;, said Buakamsri. <br /><br />In 2011, when the monsoon season brought the worst floods in decades, a fifth of the city was under water. The business district was spared thanks to hastily constructed dikes.<br /><br />But the rest of Thailand was not so fortunate and the death toll passed 500 by the end of the season.<br /><br />Experts say unchecked urbanisation and eroding shorelines will leave Bangkok and its residents in a critical situation.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">'Venice of the East'</span><br /> With the weight of skyscrapers contributing to the city's gradual descent into water, Bangkok has become a victim of its own frenetic development. <br /><br />Making things worse, the canals which used to traverse the city have now been replaced by intricate road networks, said Suppakorn Chinvanno, a climate expert at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok.<br /><br /> &quot;They had contributed to a natural drainage system,&quot; he said, adding that the water pathways earned the city the nickname 'Venice of the East'.<br /><br />Shrimp farms and other aquacultural development -- sometimes replacing mangrove forests that protected against storm surges -- have also caused significant erosion to the coastline nearest the capital.<br /><br />This means that Bangkok could be penned in by flooding from the sea in the south and monsoon floods from the north, said Chinvanno.<br /><br />&quot;Specialists anticipate more intense storms in this region in the years to come.&quot;<br /><br />Narong Raungsri, director of Bangkok's Department of Drainage and Sewage, admitted that the city's &quot;weaknesses&quot; stem from its small tunnels and the hyper-development of neighbourhoods.<br /><br />&quot;What used to act as water basins are now no more,&quot; Raungsri said. <br /><br />&quot;Our system can only handle so much -- we need to enlarge it.&quot;<br /><br />Today, the government is scrambling to mitigate the effects of climate change, constructing a municipal canal network of up to 2,600 kilometres with pumping stations and eight underground tunnels to evacuate water if disaster strikes.<br /><br /> Chulalongkorn University in 2017 also built in central Bangkok an 11-acre park specially designed to drain several million litres of rain and redirect it so surrounding neighbourhoods are not flooded.<br /><br />But these ad-hoc fixes may not be enough.<br /><br />&quot;We need a clear policy of land management,&quot; said Greenpeace's Buakamsri, adding that the need for increased green spaces is outweighed by developers' interests.<br /><br />&quot;The high price of land in Bangkok makes economic interests a priority.&quot;<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion Questions:</span><br />1.	Studies have showed that Bangkok is in the process of steady sinking and the whole city may be underwater in 15 Years. If you were Bangkok citizens, what would you do? <br />2.	Continuous sea level rise is a recent concern in Bangkok. Do you know other factors that result in the “sinking” Bangkok?<br />3.	What are the major causes of climate change? What can we do to mitigate the effects of climate change?<br />4.	Recently, Taiwan suffered from serious flooding. Do you think our government has taken the preventive measures to deal with this issue?<br />5.	Do you have any better ideas to solve Taiwan’s flooding problems?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Agenda:</span><br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />8:10 ~ 8:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:25 ~ 8:30pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:30 ~9:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~9:30pm Concluding remarks/feedback from newcomers<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The meeting place of Thursday:</span><br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第一區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元</div>
