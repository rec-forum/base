				<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Host : Ian</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Article 1</span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Guns in the US: The statistics behind the violence</span><br /><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-34996604" class="postlink">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-34996604</a><br /><br />In his first weekly address of 2016, Barack Obama vowed to take executive action to increase background checks on gun buyers.<br />His announcement followed another bloody year in the US in which thousands were killed and tens of thousands wounded by gunfire.<br />Here's a look at some of the statistics behind the violence.<br /><br />The statistics<br />Mass shootings: There were 372 mass shootings in the US in 2015, killing 475 people and wounding 1,870, according to the Mass Shooting Tracker, which catalogues such incidents. A mass shooting is defined as a single shooting incident which kills or injures four or more people, including the assailant.<br />Source: Mass Shooting Tracker<br /><br />School shootings: There were 64 school shootings in 2015, according to a dedicated campaign group set up in the wake of the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre in Connecticut in 2012. Those figures include occasions when a gun was fired but no-one was hurt.<br />Source: Everytown for Gun SafetyResearch<br />All shootings: Some 13,286 people were killed in the US by firearms in 2015, according to the Gun Violence Archive, and 26,819 people were injured [those figures exclude suicide]. Those figures are likely to rise by several hundred, once incidents in the final week of the year are counted.<br />Source: Gun Violence Archive<br />How the US compares: The number of gun murders per capita in the US in 2012 - the most recent year for comparable statistics - was nearly 30 times that in the UK, at 2.9 per 100,000 compared with just 0.1.<br />Of all the murders in the US in 2012, 60% were by firearm compared with 31% in Canada, 18.2% in Australia, and just 10% in the UK.<br />Source: UNODC.<br /><br />Homicide rate graphic<br />The home front: So many people die annually from gunfire in the US that the death toll between 1968 and 2011 eclipses all wars ever fought by the country. According to research by Politifact, there were about 1.4 million firearm deaths in that period, compared with 1.2 million US deaths in every conflict from the War of Independence to Iraq.<br />Source: Politifact.<br /><br />Total number of guns: No official figure exists but there are thought to be about 300 million in the US, held by about a third of the population. That is nearly enough guns for every man, woman and child in the country.<br />The NRA: The right to own guns is regarded by many as enshrined in the Second Amendment to the US Constitution, and fiercely defended by lobby groups such as the National Rifle Association, which boasted that its membership surged to around five million in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook school shooting.<br />Gun violence and terrorism: The US spends more than a trillion dollars per year defending itself against terrorism, which kills a tiny fraction of the number of people killed by ordinary gun crime.<br />According to figures from the US Department of Justice and the Council on Foreign Affairs, 11,385 people died on average annually in firearm incidents in the US between 2001 and 2011.<br />In the same period, an average of 517 people were killed annually in terror-related incidents. Removing 2001, when 9/11 occurred, from the calculation produces an annual average of just 31.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion</span><br />1. Do you think police in Taiwan can protect our lives?<br />2. Do you think it is fare to defend yourself from criminals, even if you have to end his or her life?<br />3. After seeing all the gun shots in the US, do you think you have to have a gun in order to stay safe in America?<br />4. There are many homicide or robbery cases happening everyday in Taiwan. Some say the public security is very poor. In that case, would you consider to allow possession of firearms is a good idea?<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Article 2</span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Do You Believe in UFOs?</span><br /><a href="http://wonderopolis.org/wonder/do-you-believe-in-ufos" class="postlink">http://wonderopolis.org/wonder/do-you-believe-in-ufos</a><br /><br />Is there life on other planets? This question fascinates everyone from adults and children to scientists and philosophers. Some of the most popular movies of all time — from Close Encounters of the Third Kind to E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial — have sparked our imaginations and kept us WONDERing about what — or who — else might be out there!<br /><br />Of course, some people firmly believe that aliens do exist. Many of these people are more fascinated with the questions of whether aliens visit Earth and, if they do, how they get here.<br /><br />Would they pilot flying saucers, or would their spacecraft be similar to what Earth's astronauts use? Or would advanced alien spacecraft look like something we've never seen before? Would we even be able to SEE alien spacecraft?<br /><br />Think about it for a minute. If aliens exist and could travel here, they would obviously have advanced technology, more advanced than the technology humans have developed. After all, it has only been since 2013 that the first human-made object even left our solar system. What kind of technology would aliens need in order to travel all the way to our solar system? Wouldn't it be interesting to find out?<br /><br />Many people believe that they have spotted alien spacecraft from time to time. From unexplained lights in the sky to mysterious objects floating on the horizon, there have been many claims of alien sightings.<br /><br />The official term for what people see during such alleged sightings is an unidentified flying object or UFO. Originally used by the military, this term refers to an unusual object in the sky that can't be immediately identified by an observer as a known object.<br /><br />Technically, the term UFO refers to any unidentified object in the sky. In our modern culture, though, the term UFO is used mainly to refer to supposed sightings of alien spacecraft.<br /><br />Alleged UFO sightings are not a purely modern phenomenon. Experts note that sightings of “mystery airships&quot; have occurred since the late 1800s. Interest in UFOs increased greatly during World War II, when American fighter pilots used the term “foo fighters&quot; to refer to unexplained sights in the sky.<br /><br />In June 1947, private pilot Kenneth Arnold reported seeing several “flying saucers&quot; or “flying discs.&quot; Around the same time, the United States military recovered debris from a highly-classified experimental high-altitude surveillance balloon that crashed near Roswell, New Mexico. Despite the military's explanations, many people believed the “Roswell UFO Incident&quot; involved the crash-landing of an alien spacecraft.<br /><br />These events led to increased interest in UFOs and whether alien life forms might visit Earth. Although some research has been done from time to time by military organizations, there has been little scientific study of UFOs. Most UFO research is conducted by private groups of individuals with an interest in the topic.<br /><br />Although a very small percentage of UFO sightings remain unexplained, most UFO sightings are eventually identified and explained. Many supposed UFO sightings are later determined to be sightings of conventional objects, such as aircraft, missiles, kites, or weather balloons.<br /><br />Many other supposed UFO sightings are eventually determined to be caused by natural phenomena, including reflective or oddly-shaped clouds and astronomical objects like meteors or planets.<br /><br />Of course, some UFO sightings are complete hoaxes. Given the amount of public interest in aliens, some people just can't resist pulling a fast one to stir up UFO enthusiasts.<br /><br />So what's the bottom line? Despite what UFO and alien enthusiasts might believe, the U.S. government's official position is that there is “no evidence that any life exists outside our planet, or that an extraterrestrial presence has contacted or engaged any member of the human race.&quot;<br /><br />Try It Out<br /><br />What do YOU think? Do aliens exist? Get together with a few friends or family members to explore the subject of UFOs in greater depth:<br /><br />What do you think an alien spacecraft would look like? How big would it need to be? What special features would it need in order to travel long distances through space? Design your own alien spacecraft and then create a unique piece of artwork to show what it looks like. Feel free to use whatever craft supplies you want: crayons, colored pencils, boxes, markers, or even clay!<br /><br />What kinds of technology would alien spacecraft feature? Modern cars have MP3 players, satellite radio, heated seats, cameras that show what's behind you, and a host of all sorts of other neat stuff. Modern aircraft are guided with GPS navigation systems and auto pilots. With advanced technology, surely alien spacecraft would feature a wide variety of amenities that would amaze and astound us humans. Brainstorm the kinds of things you'd likely find on or in an alien spacecraft. Would they have interstellar television? What about cup holders that actually hold every size soft drink imaginable? Something even better? Compile a fantastic list of what one might expect to find in the latest alien spacecraft and share it with your friends. What ideas do they have? How fast might an alien spacecraft be able to travel? Do some research to find out how fast modern vehicles can travel. How fast can the fastest cars go? What about airplanes? Could an alien spacecraft exceed the speed of light?<br /><br />How fast is that, by the way? Create a bar graph that compares the speeds of cars and planes with the speeds of sound and light. Then add a bar for how fast you think alien spacecraft might be able to travel. Show your graph to someone else and explain to them your reasoning for your estimate of the speed of alien spacecraft. Have fun imagining!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion</span><br />1. Do you believe in UFO and aliens?<br />2. Do you know anything about UFO? Share with the group.<br />3.
