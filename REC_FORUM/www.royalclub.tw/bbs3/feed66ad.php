Civil Code reform: adulthood at 18, no 50/50 divorce assets<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/lang/archives/2021/01/04/2003749883">https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/lang/a ... 2003749883</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The Legislative Yuan “cleared its stocks” at the end of the year by passing several important bills. Among them, a bill to amend some articles of the Civil Code, along with the Enforcement Law for Part IV, Family Law of the Civil Code, was passed on Dec. 25, lowering the age of majority from 20 to 18. Meanwhile, for the sake of equality, the minimum age of marriage for both men and women will be the same — 18 years old, which is no change for men, but it had been 16 years old for women before the amendment. A buffer period was set before the amendments take effect on Jan. 1, 2023. This is the first major change of its kind in the Civil Code since its enactment and implementation in 1929.<br /><br />Legislative Speaker You Si-kun, who presided at the meeting, said afterwards on his Facebook page that this is a prelude to the major task of amending the constitution. It has been the consensus of the ruling and opposition parties to revise the age threshold for the exercise of civil rights to 18 years old. The UK, France, and Germany changed their civil rights age threshold to 18 years old back in the 1970s. Taiwan’s neighbor Japan also completed such youth movement reforms in 2018.<br /><br />On Dec. 30, the legislature also passed on its third reading an amendment to Article 1030-1 of the Civil Code, whereby, when filing for divorce, the interests or income through utilization of the property acquired by one party before the marriage relationship will not have to be distributed equally to both parties if the other party did not contribute to acquiring the assets or cooperate in their utilization.<br /><br />Question<br />1.Do you agree no 50/50 divorce assets ? Why?<br />2.Which one do you prefer ‘’Financial independence’’ or ‘’ Share’’? Why?<br />3.Do you agree to make a financial agreement before marry?<br />4.Who should play a role to arrange money?

Or maybe you feel like your blood is boiling beneath your skin.Even though you may know what the external cause of your anger is, what's actually going on inside your body when you're angry that's what we're gonna find out.<br /><br />Imagine that you are driving on a freeway and somebody suddenly cuts you off.<br />You will most likely get angry and either honk your horn, or possibly give them a not-so-nice hand gesture. Admit it, we've all done it before.<br /><br />Inside your brain, the amygoala, which responses to outside stimuli, processes the car that cut you off, and coordinates the release of neurotransmitters, called catecholamines.These cause you to feel a burst of energy preparing you for physical action.The hormones, epinephrine and norepinephrine, are also released, increasing your blood pressure.Your heart rate increases and your face may flush as the blood rushes to your extremities.<br /><br />If you have ever seen someone so angry that they turn red as a lobster, this is why.<br />If you want to keep this anger at bay, you'll have to use your prefrontal cortex.<br />You can think of this as the area that controls your judgement.And if you don't use your prefrontal cortex, you may act aggressively toward others.<br /><br />Take Phineas Gage as an example.<br />In 1848, while at work, a tamping iron was shot through his left cheek and exited through the top of his head. Somehow, he survived, but his frontal lobe was severely damaged. After his injury, he is said to have been fitful, irreverent and have the animal passions of a strong man.Perhaps the damage to his frontal lobe destroyed his ability to control his behavior.<br />He was not only a new man, but also one incapable of self-constraint.<br />It's also important to note that constant chronic anger can greatly increase a person's chance of getting a heart disease, like high blood pressure or heart attacks.<br /><br />Anger and the heart are very connected. This is because epinephrine and norepinephrine constrict blood vessels, making your heart pump harder. These two hormones also increase the amount of glucose and fatty acids in the blood.<br />The increased levels can lead to damage in artery walls and speed up the process of atherosclerosis.When the fatty plaque builds up in the arteries, it narrows them and decreases the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the body. This can lead to a heart attack, stroke or death.<br />But, fear not, there are healthy ways to control your anger, such as meditation, anger management therapy, exercise or even just relaxing and doing something fun.<br /><br />Question<br />1.What kind of things make you angry?<br />2.What can you do to get over that feeling?<br />3.Do you have some tips to control your emotion?<br />4.Do you remember the details that the most angry you had?<br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00 ~ 7:30 pm greetings &amp; free talk<br />7:30 ~ 8:15 pm guests introduced &amp; first session discussion<br />8:15 ~ 8:45 pm presentation, sharing the article &amp; other experiences<br />8:45 ~ 9:30 pm second session discussion<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven,<br />板橋民生路二段237 號,<br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30,<br /><br />P.S.<br />1.因聚會地點是在咖啡店內，所以有低消80元喔！<br />2.參加三次後，只要繳交1000元 (學生:500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />3.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=872">Shuman</a> — Sat Jan 30, 2021 10:21 pm</p><hr />
