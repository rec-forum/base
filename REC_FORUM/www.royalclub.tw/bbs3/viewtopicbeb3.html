				<div class="content">Signs of domestic violence or abuse<br />Intimate partner violence, or domestic violence, can be difficult to see if it starts little by little, if your partner says they love you, or if they support you financially. Domestic violence can include forced sex, physical abuse, and emotional abuse, such as cruel words or threats. It can happen between married people, to a couple who lives together or apart, or to a same-sex couple. Abuse is never OK.<br />You may be experiencing domestic violence if your partner:<br />•	Controls what you’re doing<br />•	Checks your phone, email, or social networks without your permission<br />•	Forces you to have sex when you don’t want to<br />•	Controls your birth control or insists that you get pregnant<br />•	Decides what you wear or eat or how you spend money<br />•	Prevents or discourages you from going to work or school or seeing your family or friends<br />•	Humiliates you on purpose in front of others<br />•	Unfairly accuses you of being unfaithful<br />•	Destroys your things<br />•	Threatens to hurt you, your children, other loved ones, or your pets<br />•	Hurts you physically (e.g., hitting, beating, punching, pushing, kicking), including with a weapon<br />•	Blames you for his or her violent outbursts<br />•	Threatens to hurt herself or himself because of being upset with you<br />•	Threatens to report you to the authorities for imagined crimes<br />•	Says things like, “If I can’t have you, then no one can”<br />What can I do if I’m being abused?<br />If you are not in immediate danger, consider these options:<br />•	Get medical care. If you have been injured or sexually assaulted, go to a local hospital emergency room or urgent care center. You need medical care and may need medicines after being injured or raped.<br />•	Make a safety plan to leave. Domestic violence usually does not get better. Think about a safe place for you to go and other things you will need. Staff at the National Domestic Violence Hotline (link is external) can help you plan.<br />•	Save the evidence. Keep evidence of abuse, such as pictures of your injuries or threatening emails or texts, in a safe place the abuser cannot get to.<br />•	Find out where to get help in your community. Look up local resources (link is external) for a list of local places to get help.<br />•	Talk to someone. Reach out to someone you trust. This might be a family member, a friend, a co-worker, or a spiritual leader. Look for ways to get emotional help, like a support group or mental health professional.<br />•	Look into a restraining order. Consider getting a protection order.<br />If you are the victim of domestic violence, know that you are not alone. There are people who want to help you and who are trained to respond. See our page on leaving an abusive relationship for tips on what to do and where to go.<br /><br />Question<br />1.	How can we know he/she is domestic violence?<br />2.	Have you ever met it or heard it from your friends? Tell us your story.<br />3.	How can we do to leave violent lover?<br />4.	If your close friend tells you that his/her partner is a violent lover, how can you do?<br /><br /><br />The Most Important Thing School Never Taught You<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/67993?ref=translated">https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/67993?ref=translated</a><!-- m --><br />The quality with which we think determines the quality of our future. It's undeniable quality thinkers are critical thinkers. In my last essay you may have seen that after the first two years of college, 45% of students showed no gains in critical thinking, 45% that's almost half, it's frightening because the same system that made our cities so powerful, school, is now becoming a system of indoctrination for our young. The quality of our future is defined by the quality of our thinkers. <br />The quality of our thinkers is determined by their abilities to think critically. Before we can dive deeper into critical thinking, we need to discuss rational thinking, so let's define rational thinking, a perfectly rational being which doesn't exist makes decisions purely based on Logic data and empirical evidence. Let's assume that it's the highest form of conscious thought, critical thinking can be seen as a necessary step towards perfectly rational thinking, a critical thinker thinks offensively, they take active ownership of their learning and understanding, just as a bodybuilder finds a natural habitat in the gym, the critical thinker finds enjoyment in mental strain <br />They know a tough mental workout will strengthen their ability to think rationally. <br />A passive thinker thinks defensively how can I fit in? What will make people accept me? What will help me pass this test? They avoid mental strain and outsource the difficult thinking to others. They default on the opinion of experts Instead of forming their own. A critical thinker thinks in terms of systems, but a passive thinker thinks in terms of goals; the passive thinker asks what will get me an A on this essay? The critical thinker asks what the traits of an excellent essay are. The end result for both is the same: a perfect grade. On the surface, the two paths may seem the same, <br />But they're not. The critical thinker formed a system that can reproduce the same result in multiple situations for various people but the passive thinker achieves the result in a specific scenario. <br />The passive thinker is focused on outputs while the critical thinker is focused on inputs. This is a very subtle, but important difference in character So what benefits do habitually critical thinkers obtain over others? <br />Firstly, they're better at decision making. Critical thinkers are less likely to make sudden judgments without a clear understanding of the information at hand. <br />As a Result, they're less likely to make irrational and emotional decisions or be manipulated by others. Secondly, they're more empathetic. Critical thinkers understand that we all have our own unique view of the world. <br />They avoid judging others until they have attempted to step into their shoes and try to understand how they see the world This ability helps them diffuse tense situation and aids in persuasion. It's an essential skill for any great leader or teammate. <br />Critical thinkers are deeper learners. When they don't know something, critical thinkers admit that they don't know. <br />They only speak on topics that they have actively studied for themselves, and lastly, critical thinkers are more creative without critical thinking, creativity would not exist. If creativity is the creation of something original, then critical thinking is a crucial part of the recipe. Critical thinkers refuse to blindly accept the ideas and values of others, which results in the generation of new ideas. <br />Question<br />1. What is the critical thinking? Is it important? Why? Do you have it?<br />2. How can we learn critical thinking?<br />3. What others are important that we can NOT learn in school?<br />Agenda<br />7:00-7:30 free talk<br />(Session 1)<br />7:30-7:35 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />7:35~ 8:15 discussion session (40 mins)<br />(Session 2)<br />8:15 ~9:00pm discussion session (45 mins)<br />9:00~9:30 free talk<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
