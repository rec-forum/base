			<div class="content">5/18(Sat.)Abortion Ban&amp; 6 Side Effects of Toxic families (Host:Shuman)<br /><br />South Korea's Top Court Orders Government to End 66-Year-Old Abortion Ban<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://time.com/5568461/south-korea-abortion-ban-overturn/?utm_campaign=time&amp;utm_source=line_app&amp;utm_medium=social">http://time.com/5568461/south-korea-abo ... ium=social</a><!-- m --> <br /><br />In a victory for women’s rights in South Korea, the country’s top court ordered the government to decriminalize abortion Thursday, reforming a 66-year-long widespread ban on the procedure.<br />South Korea’s current laws governing abortion are some of  the strictest in the developed world, criminalizing the practice in most cases, and only allowing for exceptions in cases of rape, incest or if a woman’s or girl’s health is endangered by the pregnancy. In these instances, abortions must be performed within the 24 hours and are subject to spousal consent. Women who terminate pregnancies can face fines of up to KRW 2 million ($1,850) or one year in jail, and medical professionals assisting with abortions can face prison terms of up to two years if convicted.<br />Thursday’s ruling by South Korea’s Constitutional Court was related to an appeal by a doctor who was prosecuted for carrying out 70 abortions between 2013 and 2017, the Associated Press reports. The court ruling ordered South Korea’s National Assembly to create legislation easing the current regulations by the end of 2020, calling the current abortion law incompatible with the constitution.<br />Women’s rights activists and campaigners rallied outside the court in scenes of jubilation when the ruling was announced, after demonstrations had taken place to protest the ban on March 30. The case has polarized debate in South Korea in recent weeks, with anti-abortion activists carrying placards featuring fetuses also rallying outside the court.<br />“Abortions will always happen, regardless of the law. This judgment means that they should be carried out safely and legally, and that women and girls are treated with compassion and respect for their human rights and their reproductive autonomy,” said Roseann Rife, Amnesty International’s East Asia Research Director, in a statement responding to the ruling. “Their dignity must be front and centre in any new legal framework on abortion.”<br />Question<br />1. Do you agree the abortion ban? Who do you prefer ‘’woman right ‘’or ‘’human right of baby’’? Why?<br />2.Do you know the process of abortion?  What are the Side-effects?<br />3. What kind of situation people will do abortion surgery?<br />4.What will you help them if people were dilemma of abortion ? <br /> <br /><br />6 Side Effects of Toxic families<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mj4Re6YeuRQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mj4Re6YeuRQ</a><!-- m --> <br /><br />Actress Angelina Jolie had a chaotic relationship with her father growing up<br />As a result, she became estranged from him and even changed her last name to disconnect from all her painful memories. She says, &quot;I don't believe that somebody's family becomes their blood, families are earned.&quot; Titles mean nothing when you never felt close to someone who was supposed to be there, but offered little to no support.<br />Does this sound familiar?<br />Here are 6 side effects of growing up in a toxic family.<br /><br />1. You have a fear of being manipulated.<br />Toxic families often involve some sort of daily manipulation between 2 or more family members. Manipulation is a serious form of mental and emotional abuse.<br />Whether you've been directly manipulated or watched someone you love be a victim to it,<br />this can cause you to grow fearful of this toxic behavior.<br />As a result, you may become avoidant of others in order to protect yourself.<br />2. You struggle with developing your self-identity.<br />People who come from toxic families often struggle with image and low self-esteem issues because they weren't nurtured to have confidence in themselves.<br />You might have grown up with parents who never respected your boundaries,<br />often verbally abused you, or didn't allow you room for you to develop your own beliefs, dreams and interests. Consequently, you begin to see yourself in a negative light.<br />Instead of having nurturing parents who helped you except your flaws,<br />mistakes, and failures, you faced harsh criticism on a daily basis.<br />Without a healthy sense of steam, one can miss out on fulfilling their talents and potential.<br />3. You have difficulty trusting others.<br />Children first learn how to form relationships with others from their parents.<br />Toxic parents often give children a reason to close up, and they become distrustful of the world. When you learn to put walls up out of fear of being vulnerable, it makes it hard for you to connect and relate with others.<br />4. You have trouble interacting socially.<br />Studies from Texas Woman's University shows that adults who were raised in<br />dysfunctional families reported struggles maintaining romantic relationships and overcoming their insecurities because they feared losing control.<br />As a result, many of them would deny reality and their own feelings.<br />When you grow up in a household that exposes you to neglect, abuse, and mistreatment, the last thing you want to do is get close to people who might let you down or betray you.<br />5. You have anxiety overload.<br />According to a study published in The Journal Of Behavior Therapy And<br />Experimental Psychiatry, people who were raised in a dysfunctional<br />household are more likely to be diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. As a result,<br />children who grew up in a toxic environment are at risk of developing problems with their academics, social life and impulse control, because their brain<br />is continuously exposed to cortisol, the stress hormone. Systems of Generalized Anxiety Disorder include headaches, irritability, muscle tension, sweating constant worrying,<br />and feelings of restlessness.<br />6. You deal with the trauma by going through emotional cutoff or estrangement from your family. Once children from toxic families grow up into adults who can financially support themselves, they often experience emotional cutoff or estrangement to<br />disconnect from their unresolved family conflict. Emotional cutoff, coined by American psychiatrist Marie Bowen, is a process that involves either physically<br />distancing oneself from a family member or avoiding sensitive topics in a conversation to reduce anxiety. Some people choose to disconnect from their family members<br />because it's better than drowning along who hasn't changed<br />or been treated for their unhealthy behavior. Have you experienced these side effects?<br />We know that sometimes it might seem impossible to recover from them, but were here to offer a safe, judgment free space where you can talk about what you've faced. <br />Thanks for watching!<br />Question<br />1.Have you ever meet any type of toxic family?  <br />2.We can NOT choice our family, how can we recovery on our own from toxic family?<br />3.Do you have tips to change the situation?<br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00-7:30 free talk<br />(Session 1)<br />7:30-7:35 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />7:35~ 8:15 discussion session (40 mins)<br />(Session 2)<br />8:15 ~9:00pm discussion session (45 mins)<br />9:00~9:30 free talk<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
