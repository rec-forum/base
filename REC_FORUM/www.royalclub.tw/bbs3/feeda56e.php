Session I:<br />You're acting like spoiled irresponsible children<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.eesc.europa.eu/en/news-media/videos/youre-acting-spoiled-irresponsible-children-speech-greta-thunberg-climate-activist">https://www.eesc.europa.eu/en/news-medi ... e-activist</a><!-- m --><br /><br />My name is Greta Thunberg, I am a climate activist from Sweden and today in this room there are also - if you can come up - Anuna, Adélaïde, Kyra, Gilles, Dries, Toon and Luisa.<br /><br />Tens of thousands of children or schools are striking for the climate on the streets of Brussels. Hundreds of thousands are doing the same all over the world. We are school striking because we have done our homework. And some of us are here today. People always tell us that they are so hopeful. They are hopeful that the young people are going to save the world, but we are not. There is simply not enough time to wait for us to grow up and become the ones in charge. Because by the year 2020 we need to have bended the emissions curve steep downward.<br /><br />That is next year. We know that most politicians don't want to talk to us. Good, we don't want to talk to them either. We want them to talk to the scientists instead. Listen to them, because we are just repeating what they are saying and have been saying for decades. We want you to follow the Paris agreement and the IPCC reports. We don't have any other manifests or demands, you unite behind the science that is our demand. When many politicians talk about the school strike for the climate, they talk about almost anything except for the climate crisis.<br /><br />Many people are trying to make the school strikes a question of whether we are promoting truancy or whether we should go back to school or not. They make up all sorts of conspiracies and call us puppets who cannot think for ourselves. They are desperately trying to remove the focus from the climate crisis and change the subject. They don't want to talk about it because they know they cannot win this fight. Because they know they haven't done their homework, but we have. Once you have done your homework you realize that we need new politics, we need new economics where everything is based on a rapidly declining and extremely limited remaining carbon budget.<br /><br />But that is not enough. We need a whole new way of thinking. The political system that you have created is all about competition. You cheat when you can, because all that matters is to win, to get power. That must come to an end, we must stop competing with each other, we need to cooperate and work together and to share the resources of the planet in a fair way. We need to start living within the planetary boundaries, focus on equity and take a few steps back for the sake of all living species. We need to protect the biosphere, the air, the oceans, the soil, the forests.<br /><br />This may sound very naive, but if you have done your homework then you know that we don't have any other choice. We need to focus every inch of our being on climate change, because if we fail to do so than all our achievements and progress have been for nothing and all that will remain of our political leaders’ legacy will be the greatest failure of human history. And they will be remembered as the greatest villains of all time, because they have chosen not to listen and not to act. But this does not have to be. There is still time. According to the IPCC report we are about 11 years away from being in a position where we set off an irreversible chain reaction beyond human control.<br /><br />To avoid that unprecedented changes in all aspects of society, [actions] need to have taken place within this coming decade, including a reduction of our CO2 emissions by at least 50 percent by the year 2030. And please note that those numbers do not include the aspect of equity, which is absolutely necessary to make the Paris agreement work on a global scale, nor do they include tipping points or feedback loops like the extremely powerful methane gas released from the thawing Arctic permafrost. They do, however, include negative emission techniques on a huge planetary scale that is yet to be invented, and that many scientists fear will never be ready in time and will anyway be impossible to deliver at the scale assumed. We have been told that the EU intends to improve its emission reduction targets. In the new target, the EU is proposing to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 45 percent below 1990’s level by 2030. Some people say that is good or that is ambitious. But this new target is still not enough to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius.<br /><br />This target is not sufficient to protect the future for children growing up today. If the EU is to make its fair contribution to staying within the carbon budget for the two-degree limit, then it means a minimum of 80 percent reduction by 2030 and that includes aviation and shipping. So [it is] around twice as ambitious as the current proposal. The actions required are beyond manifestos or any party politics. Once again, they sweep their mess under the carpet for our generation to clean up and solve. Some people say that we are fighting for our future, but that is not true. We are not fighting for our future, we are fighting for everyone's future. And if you think that we should be in school instead, then we suggest that you take our place in the streets striking from your work. Or better yet, join us so it can speed up the process.<br /><br />And I am sorry, but saying everything will be alright while continue doing nothing at all is just not hopeful to us. In fact, it's the opposite of hope. And yet this is exactly what you keep doing. You can't just sit around waiting for hope to come, you're acting like spoiled irresponsible children. You don't seem to understand that hope is something you have to earn. And if you still say that we are wasting valuable lesson time then let me remind you that our political leaders have wasted decades through denial and inaction. And since our time is running out we have decided to take action. We have started to clean up your mess and we will not stop until we are done.<br /><br />Q1. According the speech, “our time is running out we have decided to take action”. Do you believe that the global warming is more serious than thought?<br />Q2. Many people are trying to make the school strikes a question of whether we are promoting truancy or whether we should go back to school or not. What is your opinion?<br />Q3. What are the difficulties in following the Paris agreement and the IPCC reports?<br />Q4. What is the homework she is asking us to do? what else what can we do?<br /><br />Session II:<br />'Not banned, not encouraged': Taiwan takes position on face masks<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3792476">https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3792476</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Minister of Interior Hsu Kuo-yung explains government position ahead of National Day celebrations<br />TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — After a controversial mask ban in Hong Kong was enacted by the local government as an emergency measure to help crack down on protesters, people in Taiwan have been anxiously awaiting for Taipei to weigh in on the issue of wearing masks during protests.<br /><br />The question has been hotly debated in the lead-up to Taiwan’s National &quot;Double Ten Day&quot; celebrations on Oct. 10, when large crowds are expected in Taipei. Speaking at the Legislative Yuan on Tuesday (Oct. 8), Minister of the Interior Hsu Kuo-yung (徐國勇) gave the government’s official position that “face masks are not banned, but they are not encouraged.”<br /><br />Hsu issued the statement in response to a question from Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker Lo Ming-Tsai (羅明才) during a policy inquiry regarding the legality of wearing masks at mass public gatherings. Hsu explained that whether one wears a mask or not is superficial, but what must be respected above all is freedom and democracy.<br /><br />Lo observed that according to the law, it is entirely legal for people to wear masks in public in Taiwan. However, she stressed that the issue needs to be considered rationally because, in the event of criminal behavior, face masks can potentially hinder law enforcement investigations.<br /><br />In reference to the upcoming National Day parade and celebrations, Minister Hsu said that, in principle, masks remain legally permitted at public gatherings, reports CNA. When Lo expressed concern that such a statement might encourage some people to wear masks, Hsu said that while face masks remain legal, they are not encouraged and that as a mature democracy, Taiwan should not be overly concerned about their use.<br /><br />Premier Su Tseng-chang (蘇貞昌) agreed with Hsu’s comments, remarking that the &quot;Assembly and Parade Act&quot; (遊行法) has been in place for many years (since 2002). The government has never encouraged the use of masks at such events, and there have been no serious problems involving face masks at previous years’ celebrations, observed the premier.<br />Q1. What do you think about the prohibition of masks worn by protesters?<br />Q2. Do you support the government on the issue of wearing masks during protests? Why or why not?<br />Q3. What would make you take part in a protest? For example: Democracy, Increased Tax, Government Corruption, Global Warming, Equal Rights or Labor Strikes.<br />Q4. What is your comment about minister of the Interior saying, ‘Not banned, not encouraged'?<br /><br /><br />Suggested Agenda<br />7:00 p.m. --7:30 p.m. Free talk<br />7:30 p.m. --8:10 p.m. First topic discussion<br />8:10 p.m. --8:40 p.m. Presentation (At least two members of each table are invited)<br />8:40 p.m.-- 9.:15 p.m. Second topic discussion<br />9:15 p.m.-- 9:30 p.m. Presentation (Participants that haven't presented yet are invited)<br /><br />speaker time: 2 minutes for each speaker<br />host time: 3 minutes<br /><br />The meeting place of Thursday:<br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第三區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=89">AndrewWang</a> — Fri Oct 11, 2019 6:28 pm</p><hr />
