Article 1: Manage your energy, not your time<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.talentsquare.com/blog/book-review-manage-your-energy-not-your-time/">https://www.talentsquare.com/blog/book- ... your-time/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Organizations are demanding ever-higher performance from their employees. People are trying to comply, but the usual method – putting in longer hours – has proven to be inefficient. Employees are getting exhausted, disengaged and are more likely to quit.<br /><br />Longer days at the office do not work because time is a limited resource whereas, according to Schwartz and McCarthy, personal energy is renewable. Energy comes from the body, emotions, mind and spirit. By fostering simple rituals that help employees regularly rejuvenate their energy, organizations build workers’ physical, emotional and mental resilience. These rituals are behaviors that are intentionally practiced and precisely scheduled, with the goal of making them unconscious and automatic as quickly as possible. Most large organizations invest in developing employees’ skills, knowledge and competence. Very few help build and sustain their capacity (their energy), which is often taken for granted. Greater capacity makes it possible to get more done in less time at a higher level of engagement and with more sustainability.<br /><br />Manage Your Energy, Not Your Time<br /><br />Physical energy<br />The energy renewal program begins by focusing on physical energy. Inadequate nutrition, exercise, sleep and rest diminish people’s basic energy levels, as well as their ability to manage their emotions and focus their attention. Examples of renewing your physical energy include: eating small meals and light snacks every three hours, engaging in cardiovascular activities at least three times a week, and taking brief but regular breaks, away from your desk, at 90- to 120-minute intervals throughout the day. These breaks for renewal result in higher and more sustainable performance. The length of renewal is less important than the quality.<br /><br />Emotional energy<br />When people are able to take more control of their emotions, they can improve the quality of their energy. To do this, they must become more aware of how they feel at various points during the workday and of the impact these emotions have on their effectiveness. People tend to perform better when they are feeling positive energy and are not able to perform when they are feeling any other way. Without intermittent recovery, people are not physiologically capable of sustaining highly positive emotions for long periods. Because people are confronted with high demands and unexpected challenges, they tend to experience negative emotions a few times a day. When executives learn to recognize which events trigger their negative emotions, they are able to take control of their reactions.<br />Deep abdominal breathing is a ritual for defusing negative emotions such as irritability, impatience, anxiety and insecurity. Exhaling slowly for five seconds induces relaxation and recovery. A ritual that fuels positive emotions is expressing appreciation to others, which is as beneficial to the giver as to the receiver. Examples include a handwritten note, an e-mail, a call and a conversation (the more detailed and specific, the higher the impact). As with all rituals, choosing a fixed time to do it, increases the chance for success.<br />People can also improve positive emotions by learning to change the stories they tell themselves about the events in their lives. Becoming aware of the difference between the facts in a given situation and the way you interpret those facts can be powerful in itself. The most effective way people can change a story is to view it through any of three lenses, which are alternatives to seeing the world from the victim perspective:<br />•You can adopt a ‘reverse lens’ to ask, “What would the other person in this conflict say, and how might he or she be right?”.<br />•You can use a “long lens” to ask, “How will I likely view this situation in six months?”.<br />•You can employ a ‘wide lens’ to ask, “How can I grow and learn from this situation?”.<br /><br />Mental energy<br />Many executives view multitasking as a necessity, but it actually undermines productivity. A temporary shift in attention from one task to another increases the amount of time necessary to finish the primary task by 25%. It is more efficient to fully focus for 90 to 120 minutes, take a true break, and then fully focus on the next activity. To renew your mental energy, you should perform high-concentration tasks away from phones and e-mail. Another example is to respond to voice mails and e-mails at designated times during the day. You should also identify (every night) the most important challenge for the next day and make this your first priority when you arrive at work in the morning.<br /><br />Spiritual energy<br />If the work people are doing really matters to them, they typically feel more positive energy, focus better and show greater perseverance. To renew your spiritual energy, you need to identify your “sweet spot” activities, those that give you feelings of effectiveness, effortless absorption and fulfilment – and – find ways to do more of them. You should for example delegate the tasks you hate doing to someone who loves doing them. You should allocate time and energy to what you consider most important. For example, spend the last 20 minutes of your evening relaxing, so you can connect with your family once you are home. You should practice your core values in your everyday behavior. There can be a gap between the values you aspire to and how you currently behave. For example, if consideration is important to you, but you are always late for meetings, practice intentionally showing up five minutes earlier.<br /><br />How companies can help<br />To succeed, renewal efforts need support and commitment from senior management. Organizational support entails shifts in policies, practices and cultural messages. Firms can build “renewal rooms” where people can regularly go to relax and refuel. They can subsidize gym memberships, encourage managers to gather employees for midday workouts, and suggest that people stop checking e-mails during meetings to make the meetings more efficient. Organizations invest in their people across all dimensions of their lives to help them build and sustain their value. Individuals respond by bringing all their multidimensional energy to work every day. Both grow in value as a result.<br /><br />Discussion:<br /><br />1.Do you usually work overtime? Do you think putting in longer hours at work helps your performance? Why?<br />2.Do you agree that the secret to better work is to manage your energy not your time?  Why? Or why not?<br />3.Energy comes from four main wellsprings in human beings: the body, emotions, mind, and spirit. Please discuss with your team about how to manage energy in each of them. <br />4.Does your company or do you know any company who has provided some measures and benefits to support the employees to improve their positive energy? Please talk about these measures and benefits with your team.<br /><br /><br />Article 2: How mobile apps have changed our lives<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.thedailystar.net/bytes/how-mobile-apps-have-changed-our-lives-1392175">https://www.thedailystar.net/bytes/how- ... es-1392175</a><!-- m --><br /><br />In this day and age, one thing that we all consider an indispensable part of our lives is smartphones. This device allows us to stay in touch by calling and texting our loved ones, brainstorm by browsing the web, get work done by managing teams, and stay fit by tracking how we move. Undoubtedly, almost anything and everything can be done using smartphones. But what make these devices so useful are apps. Apps are, in a way, the heart and soul of every smartphone. People around the world wake up and open one of the numerous apps installed on their phones.<br /><br />It is clear that apps have changed the way we live our lives. However, it is entirely possible to overlook the profound impact apps have on our lives. Let's have a look at how these apps impact our lives.<br /><br />According to the 106-page report published by Hootsuite and We Are Social, more than one-third of the world's population has access to mobile apps.  That's 2.549 billion people. And this figure has gone up by 30 percent since last year, which is an additional 581 million. The most amazing part is: out of the 2.549 billion app users of the world, 1.441 billion reside in the Asia Pacific region.<br /><br />Coming down to the specifics. How much time do people spend on different types of apps? According to a study conducted by Flurry Analytics, the amount is bewildering. Users spend a whooping three hours and 40 minutes on apps – the majority of which is spent on social media (nearly 27 percent). You might think that since so many people use apps, there would be a wide variety in usage. Sadly, you couldn't be more wrong. Out of nearly four million apps on the Apple and Google Stores combined, only 36 apps are being installed by a regular user; out of those 36, only 26 are being used regularly. By regularly we mean apps that are being used at least once a month. But if we look into apps that are being used daily, the number won't cross 10-12. Of the 36 installed apps, 25 percent will be used once per six months. All these figures suggest one very simple thing: we are way too much reliant on a handful of apps for our day-to-day activities.<br /><br />So how do apps play their part in daily life? According to a study conducted by University of Washington, the average tech savvy user has up to 349 encounters with apps in 18 hours, assuming six hours of sleep. And this starts every morning since the first thing that a user does after waking up is pick up their phone. 93.8 percent of the case subjects responded that they open their phone's email and calendar app in the very first hour of their day. Then they put on music through a streaming app, call for cabs or rides using apps, and check their social media updates during the entire commute. The app encounter rate slows down when the user enters the office, but slowly picks up as the day goes by. By evening, when everyone is leaving the office, the app encounter rate skyrockets and stays that way till around three in the night.<br /><br />These app encounters have essentially changed the way we lead our lives. People who never used to go on walks are now installing health tracker apps and keeping tabs on their activity. People who never liked playing games outdoor now walk miles to find a rare Pokémon. And people who were too lazy to cook their own food now resort to apps to have healthy, home-cooked food delivered to their doorsteps.<br /><br />In Bangladesh, we have seen people mostly using apps for social media and email or even chatting. But slowly and steady that trend is changing. We now have an increased volume of YouTube views in the last couple of years. Moreover utility and productivity based app are also more frequently being used. Starting from ride hailing services like Uber or Pathao to food delivery services like Hungry Naki or Food Panda to balance recharging apps like Udoy or Easy.com.bd – all are being plugged in to our daily app ecosystem. Banking and billing services are quite popular too. Most of the prominent banks now have app of their own using which you can do the very basic stuff. Some has advance features including inter-bank transfer, balance sheet management, auto-debit instruction option etc. With apps like Tonic, Doctorola or even Rx71 you can setup appointment with doctors. You can also see what medicines to subscribe, pay for your medical insurance and get health tips on a regular basis.<br /><br />If you want to keep yourself entertained, they you need not to look much further. Even without YouTube there is thousands of local app that are dedicated for this purpose only. Most of the operators now have music &amp; video streaming apps with a rich content library. Though local mobile gaming industry is at a very nascent stage, still there are some promising local games that have garnered quite a fan base.<br />To be honest, if you look back even just couple years back, you won't find this sort of app dependence. Truly, apps now have changed the way how we lead our lives. <br /><br />Discussion:<br /><br />1.How mobile apps impact your lives? Please share with your team the difference in your daily lives before and after you started to use smartphone.<br />2.What apps do you use every day? Please introduce three apps you think interesting or maybe helpful to the team. What apps do you use to learn English?<br />3.Smartphone is getting more and more important in our daily lives. What are the pros and cons of using smartphone?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2359">selinafan</a> — Tue Jun 05, 2018 1:22 pm</p><hr />
