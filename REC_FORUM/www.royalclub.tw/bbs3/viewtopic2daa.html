				<div class="content">3/30(Sat.)How it feels to save a life \Native speaker are the world’s worst communicators(Host:William)<br /><br /><br />Article  I:How it feels to save a life<br />Link:https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/477ad856-eb03-437d-85ce-0948be720077<br /><br />From donating a kidney to saving someone who's tried to take their own life - three people tell their stories<br /><br />Self-sacrifice and altruism are some of the most highly prized qualities in society. So much so that heroes bleed into every aspect of popular culture, from that Enrique Iglesias song to the latest Marvel movie. Scientists have studied the special qualities of people who behave selflessly, particularly towards strangers, to try to find out what sets them apart, with one study finding that they just have more empathy for others.<br /><br />But what does it actually take to save a life? Could any of us do it under the right, or wrong, circumstances? And how does it feel to be a real-life hero?<br /><br />Here, three inspiring individuals share exactly how it felt to save a life under unexpected circumstances.<br />‘I gave a stranger my kidney’<br />Kayleigh Wakeling, 33, Hertfordshire<br />I was scrolling through Facebook one day and I saw a family friend had shared a post about her friend Louise, who desperately needed a kidney. It said she had end-stage kidney failure and was just 29. I had the same blood type and I instantly knew I could help. I asked my friend to put me in contact with Louise and then messaged her, explaining I was willing to help. She immediately responded by asking if I was serious.<br />Initially, Lou sent me lots of links to information about kidney donation to make sure that I was making an informed decision – I think she was just shocked that a total stranger wanted to help. But I never changed my mind. We chatted a lot via text message about everything in our lives and really got to know each other. The next step was meeting in person so that we could have the initial blood tests required. I was so, so nervous. It was like a really weird blind date but we hit it off straight away.<br />She just kept asking me: “Why? You don’t even know me.” And, honestly, I don’t know why. If someone you loved needed a kidney and someone else could help them then you’d want them to, wouldn’t you? From the moment I saw that post I wanted to do it.<br /><br />You go through so many stages to find out if you will be a match, from tests to psychological evaluations. But when I got the final call from the kidney coordinator confirming it was going ahead, I just burst into tears. I was so, so happy. I persuaded the coordinator to let me be the one to tell Louise. She was already so special to me and I was so relieved to know that I could help her. You just can’t describe that feeling - telling someone that you’re going to save their life is just indescribable.<br />The surgery is stressful because you don’t know for sure if the kidney is going to take or if you’ll wake up and find out that it may not be viable. There are also the same risks from the operation that come with any surgery. I had so many thoughts going through my head. I was so excited but I was also nervous because I’d never had an operation before. But, even though I was scared, I knew my feelings would be nothing compared to what Lou was going through. I went down to theatre first and then Louise went in two hours later. We were both in for about four hours each.<br />Afterwards, we were both really ill but we had beds next to each other, so we were together when we found out that the kidney had taken. Lou started to look better almost instantly. It was a huge and painful experience – I was in hospital for four days and off work for 12 weeks – but it was just such a massive, massive relief to know that it was all worth it, and that she was ok.<br />The experience has given me a sense of pride in myself. Knowing that I was mentally strong enough to go through this process has given me a confidence that wasn’t there before. Lou and I have maintained a really strong relationship. We check in with each other every day, even when we’re on holiday. I am basically checking up on my kidney! And I'm always wondering how she's doing, and if she's ok. We have formed a friendship for life.<br /><br /><br /><br />'I saved someone from suicide'<br /><br />Jessica*, 30, London<br />Over the course of my four years working at an inpatient unit for young people diagnosed with eating disorders, emerging personality disorders, depression and anxiety, I have had to deal with more suicide attempts and serious self-harm than I can even recollect. But it doesn't get easier and each one always feels like the first time, especially when the patient is a child.<br />The most significant occasion for me was when I was on my own and I came across a young teen who had attempted to kill themselves.<br />You always follow the same protocol: press the alarm, deal with any immediate danger and then emotionally support the young person, before other nursing interventions.<br />During the alarm-pressing, your adrenaline is high and you have no time to think or feel because the young person's life is at stake. But, in the aftermath, when you’re supporting the young person who is crying in your arms and begging you to just let them die, it's difficult not to have an emotional response.<br />On this occasion, I found it even harder than usual to console them. I did so but, having gone through my own personal problems with my mental health that week, I felt like I didn't have the capacity to support them in the way I normally would, which made me feel even worse. I can usually keep calm and be supportive but this time I felt my eyes filling up and I had to swap with another member of staff when someone else arrived.<br />For me, this just goes to show how important therapy, supervision and reflecting on how your work is affecting you is for staff on the frontline. The reason I do this job is to help: to try to change the way these talented, clever, funny, young people view themselves and their lives. This experience taught me that, without mental space for staff, it can become so much harder.<br />As awful as it is to see people harming themselves, I would never want to do anything different. Because, though this moment has stayed with me for so many horrible and upsetting reasons, knowing that this young person is alive today thanks to me, and getting better, makes it all very much worth it.<br /><br /><br />'I saved a man’s life when I was 15'<br /><br /><br />Tejinder Purewall, 17, Hounslow<br />One day, I was walking to school with my friend and, as we approached the bus stop, we heard screaming and shouting and saw a crowd of people gathered around a man on the floor. I just immediately said to my friend: “Take my bag and I will meet you at school.”<br />I instantly knew I was going to help. I don’t know where that impulse came from, it was just a natural reaction. I saw the situation and I knew that he needed my help. I knew I could do something because, even though I was only 15 at the time, I’d had First Aid training from St John Ambulance through the Army Cadets.<br />First, I checked the man’s breathing, which you’re meant to do before going straight into CPR. He wasn’t breathing and he had a frothy substance coming out of his mouth. I got two other people at the bus stop to help me, asking one of them to hold his head and another to hold his legs. I pulled him towards me and cleared his mouth.<br />Then I was able to start CPR, which lasted about 20-25 minutes. I knew he wasn’t breathing at all and I had to try really hard, with even more passion and care, to help him. Then the ambulance came. This wasn’t the first time I’d used First Aid in an emergency but it was the first time I’d done it on someone who was pretty much dead - and the stakes were so much higher. There was a big crowd of people watching this too but I didn’t have time to even feel scared. I just acted.<br />I was actually in trouble right after it happened because I was late for school. I could be quite cheeky at school so they didn’t actually believe me at first about where I’d been! About a week later, I got called into the head of year’ s office. Normally, when I got called in there, it wasn’t good news. But this time they said the hospital had told them that the man’s name was Antonio, he’d had a heart attack and I had actually saved his life.<br />I'd been thinking about him all week but I had no idea at the time that I had actually saved him, I was just so in the zone. It had got to the point where I couldn’t see anyone around me, just me and him and what I was doing.<br />I got an award at school for what I did and they invited Antonio and his wife and three kids without me knowing. He was 72 back then and I almost didn’t recognise him because he looked in such good health. When I saw the family they were so wonderful to me, they gave me this coin from their country, Portugal. It was of their patron saint, St Antonio, and is given as a token of respect. I am still in touch with them and we have a special relationship.<br /><br />I got the St John Ambulance Everyday Hero Young Hero award at a ceremony in London last year and that was amazing, if a bit overwhelming. I still can’t believe I was so young when it happened. I had a bad reputation with my teachers at school until then but this turned everything around for me. I don’t think I would have done my GCSEs or got my job in property today without that moment changing me.<br />I think saving a life shows you what human beings are capable of. At the time, you don’t think about how massive a thing it is - you don’t wake up thinking ‘I’m going to save a life today’- it’s just something you do, because you know you have to help.<br />* Some details have been changed<br />If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this article, information about help and support is available here.<br />Discussion<br />1. Do you have any idea after you read the article?<br />2. Have you ever save a life? (Not human being only) Please share your experience.<br />3. Let’s talk deeply. ?Do you willing to gave a stranger a kidney? Why /Why not?<br /><br />Article II: Native speaker are the world’s worst communicators<br />Link:http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20161028-native-english-speakers-are-the-worlds-worst-communicators<br />In a room full of non-native speakers, ‘there isn’t any chance of understanding’. It might be their language, but the message is often lost.<br /><br />Editor’s Note (29 December 2016): Through the end of the year, BBC Capital is bringing back some of your favourite stories from 2016.<br />It was just one word in one email, but it triggered huge financial losses for a multinational company.<br />The message, written in English, was sent by a native speaker to a colleague for whom English was a second language. Unsure of the word, the recipient found two contradictory meanings in his dictionary. He acted on the wrong one.<br />Months later, senior management investigated why the project had flopped, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. “It all traced back to this one word,” says Chia Suan Chong, a UK-based communications skills and intercultural trainer, who didn't reveal the tricky word because it is highly industry-specific and possibly identifiable. “Things spiralled out of control because both parties were thinking the opposite.”<br />When such misunderstandings happen, it’s usually the native speakers who are to blame. Ironically, they are worse at delivering their message than people who speak English as a second or third language, according to Chong.<br />“A lot of native speakers are happy that English has become the world’s global language. They feel they don’t have to spend time learning another language,” says Chong. “But… often you have a boardroom full of people from different countries communicating in English and all understanding each other and then suddenly the American or Brit walks into the room and nobody can understand them.”<br /><br /><br />The non-native speakers, it turns out, speak more purposefully and carefully, typical of someone speaking a second or third language. Anglophones, on the other hand, often talk too fast for others to follow, and use jokes, slang and references specific to their own culture, says Chong. In emails, they use baffling abbreviations such as ‘OOO’, instead of simply saying that they will be out of the office.<br />“The native English speaker… is the only one who might not feel the need to accommodate or adapt to the others,” she adds.<br />Relating to your audience<br /> <br />With non-native English speakers in the majority worldwide, it’s Anglophones who may need to up their game.<br /> <br />“Native speakers are at a disadvantage when you are in a lingua franca situation,” where English is being used as a common denominator, says Jennifer Jenkins, professor of global Englishes at the UK’s University of Southampton. “It’s the native English speakers that are having difficulty understanding and making themselves understood.”<br /><br /><br />Non-native speakers generally use more limited vocabulary and simpler expressions, without flowery language or slang. Because of that, they understand one another at face value. Jenkins found, for instance, that international students at a British university understood each other well in English and swiftly adapted to helping the least fluent members in any group.<br />‘What the hell is ETA?’<br />Zurich-based Michael Blattner’s mother tongue is Swiss-German, but professionally he interacts mostly in English. “I often hear from non-native colleagues that they do understand me better when listening to me than when doing so to natives,” says the head of training and proposition, IP Operations at Zurich Insurance Group.<br />One bugbear is abbreviations.<br />“The first time I worked in an international context somebody said ‘Eta 16:53’ and I thought ‘What the hell is ETA?’,” says Blattner. “To add to the confusion, some of the abbreviations in British English are very different from American English.”<br />And then there’s cultural style, Blattner says. When a Brit reacts to a proposal by saying, “That’s interesting” a fellow Brit might recognise this as understatement for, “That’s rubbish.” But other nationalities would take the word “interesting” on face value, he says.<br />Unusual words, speed of talking and mumbling don’t help, he adds — especially if the phone or video connection is poor quality. “You start disengaging and doing something else because there isn’t any chance of understanding,” he says.<br />At meetings, he adds, “typically, native English speakers dominate about 90% of the time. But the other people have been invited for a reason.”<br /> <br />Dale Coulter, head of English at language course provider TLC International House in Baden, Switzerland, agrees: “English speakers with no other language often have a lack of awareness of how to speak English internationally.”<br />In Berlin, Coulter saw German staff of a Fortune 500 company being briefed from their Californian HQ via video link. Despite being competent in English, the Germans gleaned only the gist of what their American project leader said. So among themselves they came up with an agreed version, which might or might not have been what was intended by the California staff.<br />“A lot of the information goes amiss,” Coulter says.<br />When simpler is better<br />It’s the native speaker who often risks missing out on closing a deal, warns Frenchman Jean-Paul Nerriere, formerly a senior international marketing executive at IBM.<br />“Too many non-Anglophones, especially the Asians and the French, are too concerned about not ‘losing face’ — and nod approvingly while not getting the message at all,” he says.<br />That’s why Nerriere devised Globish — a distilled form of English, stripped down to 1,500 words and simple but standard grammar. “It’s not a language, it’s a tool,” he says. Since launching Globish in 2004 he’s sold more than 200,000 Globish text books in 18 languages.<br />“If you can communicate efficiently with limited, simple language you save time, avoid misinterpretation and you don’t have errors in communication,” Nerriere says.<br />As an Englishman who’s worked hard to learn French, Rob Steggles, senior marketing director for Europe at telecommunications giant NTT Communications, has advice for Anglophones. Based in Paris, Steggles says, “you need to be short, clear and direct and you need to simplify. But there’s a fine line between doing that and being patronising.”<br />“It’s a tightrope walk,” he adds.<br />Giving others a chance<br />When trying to communicate in English with a group of people with varying levels of fluency, it’s important to be receptive and adaptable, tuning your ears into a whole range of different ways of using English, Jenkins says.<br />“People who’ve learned other languages are good at doing that, but native speakers of English generally are monolingual and not very good at tuning in to language variation,” she says.<br />In meetings, Anglophones tend to speed along at what they consider a normal pace, and also rush to fill gaps in conversation, according to Steggles.<br />“It could be that the non-native speaker is trying to formulate a sentence,” he says. “You just have to wait a heartbeat and give them a chance. Otherwise, after the meeting they come up and say, ‘What was all that about?’ Or they walk away and nothing happens because they haven’t understood.”<br />He recommends making the same point in a couple of different ways and asking for some acknowledgement, reaction or action.<br />“If there’s no participation,&quot; Steggles cautions, “you don’t know whether you’ve been understood or not.”<br /><br /><br />Discussion<br />1.A little test: What is the reason why are Native speaker bad at communication.<br />2. Do you need to work in English? Have you ever confronted a misunderstand? What are the tips to improve communication?<br />3..Do you agree with the aspect of the article: Native speaker are the world’s worst communicators<br />why/why not?<br /><br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:25pm discussion session <br />8:25 ~ 8:30pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:30 ~9:30pm discussion session<br />(Session III)<br />9:30 pm Free talk<br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
