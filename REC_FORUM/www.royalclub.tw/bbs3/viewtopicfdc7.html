Brunei, Chile and Malaysia have not yet ratified the agreement.<br />The economies in the CPTPP bloc account for 13.3 percent of the world's gross domestic product (GDP), worth a total of US$10.6 trillion, and cover a population of 499 million, according to the government websites of Australia and New Zealand.<br /><br />Q1. Why is joining the CPTPP important to Taiwan's economy? <br />Q2.What are the impacts of market openness and technical matters from joining the CPTPP? <br />Q3.Japan plays a leading role in CPTPP; do you agree to end all its restrictions on nuclear food from five Japanese prefectures imports in exchange for joining the CPTPP? <br />Q4. Can we enter the CPTPP while China is against Taiwan joining?<br /><br />Session:II<br />How to Stop Procrastinating<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/12414">https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/12414</a><!-- m --><br />•	Alright, let's be honest!<br />•	Is there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?<br />•	Do you have a paper due in 10 hours?<br />•	Is there a stinky pile of laundry slowly inching its way across your bedroom floor?<br />•	You should be doing those things but instead, you're here listening to me lecture you on YouTube.<br />•	Wait wait wait wait wait, don't go away just yet.<br />•	The next five minutes will be the most productive bit of procrastination you have done all day.<br />•	And you're not the only one procrastinating.<br />•	Thanks to a suggestion by one of our viewers, today's episode of WellCast is going to bring you a three step program to wrangle your monster of procrastination into submission.<br />•	About 20 percent of the population identifies themselves as chronic procrastinators.<br />•	People who constantly put off the things that they really need to do.<br />•	And that is because procrastination is about lying to yourself.<br />•	You know, telling yourself, &quot;Uhh! I will have plenty of time to finish that paper tomorrow,&quot; when you know you are way behind.<br />•	In a recent study, two groups of university students were signed to write three papers in three weeks.<br />•	Group A was given the opportunity to turn in all papers in at any point during those three weeks.<br />•	Group B, on the other hand, had strict weekly deadlines for each paper.<br />•	Ultimately, the ones who did the best on the papers were the ones given the strict deadlines.<br />•	Group A, the students who had to pick their own deadlines, they did pretty poorly.<br />•	Clearly, humans are not the best at regulating themselves.<br />•	So when it comes to procrastination, you have to trick yourself in getting the job done.<br />•	And this brings us to our WellCast three step method for stopping procrastination.<br />•	Please pause and print out your worksheet at watchwellcast.com.<br />•	Okay, are you ready?<br />•	Step one: eat an elephant.<br />•	Hey, how do you eat an elephant?<br />•	One bite at a time?<br />•	Look, what I'm saying is, you need time to digest or you are gonna make yourself sick.<br />•	Reward yourself for getting through parts of the project rather than waiting to reward yourself after the whole thing's over.<br />•	Okay procrastinator, think about that one project that you really need to get done, but calm down.<br />•	Instead of letting it overwhelm you, organize that project into small bite-size manageable segments.<br />•	Think about what needs to get done and write down what you're going to be doing to tackle this project hour by hour, and make it specific.<br />•	By breaking down this giant project into smaller tasks, this elephant will become a lot less daunting.<br />•	Step two: pick off the itsy-bitsy Goblins instead of going for the whole dragon.<br />•	The hardest part about starting any project is always starting a project.<br />•	A good way to get around this is to start a project off with the task you like the best.<br />•	Listen, when you do something that you like, your brain releases dopamines which makes you happy.<br />•	Maybe it's decorating a cover of a report, writing a snappy intro into an otherwise incredibly boring paper.<br />•	Step three: ignore the iren's songs.<br />•	Seriously.<br />•	This step is straight out of Homer's epic poem, The Odyssey.<br />•	In The Odyssey, our protagonist Ulysses is trying to get home.<br />•	Unfortunately, this requires maneuvering through a strait of water where sailors are often lured under the rocks by creatures called &quot;sirens.&quot;<br />•	Instead of giving up, Ulysses instructs his crew to tie him to the mast of the ship and for all of them to plug their ears.<br />•	No matter how much he yells and screams to head towards the beautiful sirens, the sailors must keep on track.<br />•	We're not saying that you need to actually tie yourself up to anything,<br />•	But you should plan to clear any distractions that will hamper your ability to procrastinate later.<br />•	For example, if you're a sucker for Facebook or online video games, have your parents or your roommates change the internet password to keep you on track for studying.<br />•	The less temptations you give in to or have the ability to give in to, the better you'll be at acing that exam.<br />•	Okay kiddos, let's recap.<br />•	The best way to get around procrastination is to trick yourself into doing the work.<br />•	Haha, it's true though.<br />•	We recommend that you do this in one of three ways.<br />•	Number one: breaking your tasks into segments, in other words, you got had to eat that elephant.<br />•	Number two: start with the most enjoyable part of the project.<br />•	Go for those itsy-bitsy goblins.<br />•	And number three: avoid that siren song.<br />•	Clear out those distractions and see you can get the job done.<br />•	Are these tips of help?<br />•	Leave us a message below or email us at watchwWellCast.com.<br />•	Tweet us at watchWellCast.<br />•	Email us at <!-- e --><a href="mailto:watchWellCast@gmail.com">watchWellCast@gmail.com</a><!-- e --><br />•	Or leave a comment down below.<br />•	We'll see you next time.<br /><br />Q1. Are you a procrastinator, why or why not?<br />Q2. Do you think that procrastination is a habit, and can you break it?<br />Q3. Are these tips from the video helpful? Why or why not?<br />Q4 .If you struggle with procrastination, what impact does it give to your life? If not, how do you avoid procrastination? <br />P.S.<br />1.參加三次後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />2.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~</div>
