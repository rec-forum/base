I chose a topic about new immigrant inflow in Taiwan. The inflow of more and more “new Taiwanese” once taking citizenship, will lead to re-shaping of Taiwan society gradually such as multi-culture issues, adaptability for new immigrants melting into the pot, education, foods, political participation.,etc. Some of them might be positive strength infused into our society while some might bring society questions with negative implication if not taken care of properly. Let’s explore this topic and wish to have fun time together at the coming meeting. Thank you.<br /><br />Session 1 Abstract<br />Pei-chia (藍佩嘉), a sociology professor at National Taiwan University, arguing that treating new immigrants and migrant workers kindly is how a civilized country should act.<br /><br />Among them are blue- and white-collar workers, English teachers, senior executives, and engineers. But perhaps those with the most far-reaching impact on Taiwan are the nearly 230,000 foreign and Chinese spouses and the children they give birth to.<br /><br />The 93,000 spouses from Southeast Asia married to Taiwanese are changing Taiwan’s demographic composition. Just last year, of every 100 children born in Taiwan, eight were of mixed heritage. Taiwan is not a homogeneous nation. It is similar to the American melting pot,” said a worker in the cultural sector. “We must learn how to get along with each other.”<br /><br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://english.cw.com.tw/article/article.action?id=2937">https://english.cw.com.tw/article/artic ... on?id=2937</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Questions:<br />Q1A: Do you have any experience interacting with a new immigrant either from China, Asian countries, and so forth? What impresses you for how Taiwanese treat the new mainlander spouses or other foreign spouses?<br />Q1B: Same questions applied to migrant workers such as foreign factory labors, shipping / fishing labors, caregivers permitted from other countries to Taiwan. <br />Q1C: Should we treat new immigrants and migrant workers kindly? If you were the immigrant family, how would you treat your Chinese mainlander mate or foreign spouse?<br />Q1D: If you were the employer of the immigrant labors, how would you treat them?<br />Q2: What impact will increasing foreign and Chinese spouses lead to our society? Can you point out pros and cons of your opinions on it?<br /><br />Session 2 Abstract<br />Dramatic Rise in Chinese Spouses<br />The number of Chinese spouses in Taiwan has soared in the past three years to 154,000, nearly double the number from Southeast Asia. Of those, 148,000 are women. The Mainland Affairs Council (Taiwan’s main policymaking body on mainland China) has estimated that roughly 300,000 to 400,000 people from mainland China will obtain Taiwanese citizenship by 2015, and these “new mainlanders” will “easily be able to elect eight national legislators,” said Lin Ying-chuan (林應專), a former National Assembly member from Kaohsiung.<br /><br />Many individuals who have come from mainland China are getting into the act of joining with Taiwanese to support labor movements and team up with the New Party to affect cross-Taiwan Strait policy.<br /><br />Statistically speaking, Taiwan is now a net immigration country. Immigration has emerged as a hotly debated political issue in recent years, with many countries hoping to attract so-called “high-caliber” immigrants. Australia, Canada, and Singapore, for example, all welcome professionals with technical skills or capital to invest, and Germany has aggressively recruited high-tech specialists to strengthen the competitiveness of its information industry.<br /><br />Questions:<br />Q3: How do you view the political participation right for Chinese spouses who’ve gained citizenship in Taiwan? Should there be any difference or some sort of restriction applied to the citizenship taken by Chinese spouse? Or, it should be treated as equal as nationals born in Taiwan?<br />Q4A: What is the root causes making Taiwan become a net immigration country?<br />Q4B: It has become a trend that highly talented human resources will have great influential strength on a country’s competiveness in global economic competitions. How should Taiwan attract more and more international talents migrating to Taiwan? Does Taiwan have qualifications to persuade more and more elites migrating to our country? What are your ideas?<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">P.S.<br />1.因聚會地點是在咖啡店內，所以有低消80元喔。<br />2.參加三次後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />3.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~</span></div>
