One hemp-infused sparkling water claims it can help you feel “cool, calm, collected.”<br /><br />Stress-reducing beverages — like sparkling waters, tonics and teas suffused with trendy ingredients like CBD, hemp, amino acids and more — have been growing in popularity in recent years. The company that makes Recess, a “calming” sparkling water with hemp and botanicals, said its monthly revenues increased by 600 percent between March 2020 and September 2021. Another brand called Moment, which sells a “stress-reducing” drink with amino acids and herbs, said its sales rose by 1,775 percent between September 2020 and September 2021.<br /><br />Experts say that these drinks probably won’t hurt you, but the evidence on how, or if, they can help you is murky. Here’s the science behind the eye-catching advertising and bold claims.<br /><br />What’s in these drinks?<br />The labels and marketing materials of many of these stress-relieving drinks point to an alphabet soup of wellness ingredients and buzzwords. Some contain small doses of CBD, or cannabidiol, a compound found in marijuana and hemp that doesn’t get you high but is often taken to relieve ailments like anxiety, insomnia and pain.<br />Some brands also infuse their drinks with “adaptogens” — or “super-herbs,” as some people call them — which are a group of medicinal herbs, mushrooms and roots that include ashwagandha, lemon balm and ginseng. Such plant-based substances have been used in Chinese, Indian and Western herbal medicine to treat stress, said Dr. Yufang Lin, a doctor at the Center for Integrative Medicine at Amherst Family Health Center in Lorain, Ohio.<br /><br />Some stress-relief beverage companies also advertise that they contain amino acids like L-theanine, L-serine and L-tryptophan, which they purport can reduce stress and create a sense of calm.<br /><br />What does the evidence say?<br />The research on how well these ingredients work to promote a sense of calm and relaxation is limited at best. Some small studies in humans and animals have hinted that supplemental CBD might help with anxiety and insomnia. One 2011 study of 24 college students with social anxiety, for instance, concluded that those who took a single, 600-milligram dose of CBD before a public-speaking exercise felt more comfortable and less anxious than those who took a placebo. Another study, published in 2019, found that of 72 adults with anxiety, poor sleep or both, 57 reported improved anxiety and 48 reported improved sleep after one month of taking a daily CBD capsule. A 2015 review of 49 studies also showed promising evidence, particularly in animals, that CBD could improve certain anxiety disorders, including those linked to post-traumatic stress and obsessive compulsive disorders. Other limited studies have also suggested that CBD may help people with pain and addiction.<br /><br />Even more limited is the research that looked into using adaptogens or amino acids for stress. Those studies tend to be small and inconclusive, Dr. Lin said. “The question here is: What is the optimal dose?” she said. “And nobody knows that. There’s just not enough study.”<br />Will these drinks help calm you down?<br />They might, experts say, but even if the active ingredients do have a calming effect, they are probably in such small doses that you won’t feel much.<br />A quick peek at the nutrition labels of a dozen popular de-stressing drinks reveals just five to 25 milligrams of CBD per container. (According to the Food and Drug Administration, “it is currently illegal to market CBD by adding it to a food or labeling it as a dietary supplement.” But some states allow products containing CBD to be sold. New York, for example, permits up to 25 milligrams of cannabidiol per product.)<br /><br />“If you’re only taking in five milligrams, you’re getting a homeopathic dose. You wouldn’t notice anything,” said Jason Busse, associate director of the Michael G. DeGroote Centre for Medicinal Cannabis Research in Ontario. Research studies that have demonstrated the benefits of using CBD tend to use much larger doses, in contrast, typically between 400 and 600 milligrams, he said. And given that just a tiny fraction of the CBD will end up reaching your bloodstream, he continued, most drinks — even those at the higher end with 25 milligrams — probably won’t have an effect on your stress levels.<br /><br />The way these drinks make you feel will also depend on how they’re formulated, said Dr. Pieter Cohen, an associate professor of medicine at the Cambridge Health Alliance who studies supplements. “You can put an ingredient like ashwagandha on a label, but you can prepare the plant any which way,” he said.<br /><br />Dr. Lin agreed. When adaptogens are used traditionally for stress relief, she said, they are typically taken in precise doses. “When you add some of this in a wellness drink, that means nothing to me because I don’t know the dose, I don’t know how it’s made, I don’t know the quality,” she said.<br /><br />Representatives from Recess, Moment and Kin Euphorics, three popular drink brands that claim to help you relax, emphasized that their beverages aim to induce a sense of calm, not necessarily to treat anxiety disorders. And while no clinical trials have been done on these specific drinks, they said, their customers have reported lifted moods and cleared minds.<br /><br />Perhaps more likely, said Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University, those people who notice a benefit may actually be experiencing a placebo effect. She compared the rise of wellness drinks to the booming supplement industry; the power of suggestion is so strong, she said, that we want to believe we’re consuming a cure, even when the evidence for it is lacking.<br /><br />Will these drinks harm my health?<br />The F.D.A. has expressed concern about the proliferation of CBD products on the market, most of which are unapproved, and has noted their potential safety risks. But experts said that drinks containing CBD and the other active ingredients would probably not have a negative impact on your health. “At the doses that we’re talking about, these are relatively benign molecules,” said Ryan Vandrey, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins Medicine who researches cannabis. “They’re not really going to hurt you, but who knows if they’re going to help you either? My sense is these things are mostly marketing and gimmickry.”<br /><br />Wellness drinks also tend to be low in sugar and added sweeteners, Dr. Nestle said, and so are not likely to be detrimental from a nutritional perspective. “If people try one of these and feel better, good for them,” she said. “It’s a very stressful time, and I think everyone’s looking for something, anything, that might help.”<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">1.

Add a chronic illness or debilitating condition into the mix, and it can feel nearly impossible to keep your relationship happy and emotionally healthy.<br />Being with a person who has a long-term health condition can not only be difficult, you can also lose sight of your own mental and emotional wellness as you tend to your partner's needs.<br />Families are influential in managing chronic illness,1 and the situation often heavily impacts the mental health of loved ones.2 Ahead, learn about how to successfully navigate a chronic health issue in your relationship while still staying happy and whole.<br />Be Sure You're Up for the Role<br />The way you structure your relationship with a chronically ill person depends on whether you were already with them when they were diagnosed or met someone who already had a known condition.<br />Either way, checking in with yourself about whether you can assume the role of both caretaker and partner will help you feel secure in knowing how to proceed with your relationship.<br />Meeting Someone With a Chronic Illness<br />If you meet someone you're interested in dating seriously, and they reveal their long-term health condition, it's crucial to understand how your role will change with them. Let your partner choose what personal information they want to disclose; asking someone endless questions about their health may feel invasive. Use their answers to discern if this is a relationship that you would be up for or not.<br />Dating is difficult for the best of us, and chronically ill single people have to manage many additional factors into that already murky territory. You may be doing a disservice to a potential partner if you decide to embark on a new journey together only to leave weeks or months into the relationship because their condition is too overwhelming for you.<br />If the initial discussions of someone's health issues feel overwhelming, be honest with them and yourself.<br />A Partner Who Gets Diagnosed<br />For couples who have already been together a long time, especially for those who are married, it's usually a given that if one person becomes ill, the other will take care of them. Marriage vows usually state &quot;in sickness and in health&quot; for precisely that reason. However, it is necessary for the partner of someone diagnosed with a serious condition to make sure they are invested enough in the relationship to see it through.<br />When a partner is diagnosed, a helpful way for couples to iron out issues as they arise is to try couples therapy together. Taking this step to honestly and openly talk about the future of your relationship will help ensure that you are comfortable taking on the role of partner to an ill person. If it becomes apparent that you aren't, which may be particularly devastating to your partner, a therapist can support both of you through the breakup.<br /> Living With Someone With Mental Illness<br />Discuss Caretaking With Your Partner<br />When one person in a relationship has a chronic condition, their partner often takes on the caretaker role. For that to occur smoothly, here are key factors to discuss before the transition.<br />What Are Their Needs?<br />Your partner should clearly tell you their caretaking needs and their needs in the relationship. Illness changes the landscape of relationships, and your partner may be unenthused about you providing them with health care and support.<br />After all, much of personal care isn't necessarily sexy or romantic, and it's natural to worry about how that impacts the nature of your relationship together. When you are clear on everything they need from you, your relationship, and their own medical wellness, you can better figure out how to provide for them.<br />What Are Your Needs?<br />It's vital to remember that there are two (or more) people in your relationship, and your needs are equally important. The shift of focus to a sick person can make this easy to forget, but you won't be happy in a relationship if your needs aren't met. Also, you won't allow your partner to meet those needs without knowing and expressing them clearly.<br />If you have emotional, intellectual, or physical needs that your partner may be unable to meet, this is an opportunity to discuss how you can meet those needs to remain fulfilled as a person. This is particularly important with chronically ill partners due to how frequently the partners of ill people feel detached from their loved one.3<br />Additionally, it is common for the care of someone with a chronic illness to weigh heavily on the mental wellness of partners,4<br /> making it all the more necessary that you stay emotionally healthy and happy.<br /> Why Expressing Feelings With Your Partner Is Worth the Emotional Risk<br />What Are Your Boundaries?<br />In addition to knowing and expressing your needs, you must also know and express your boundaries to successfully navigate a relationship with a chronically ill partner. If there are some personal care tasks you don't think you could physically or emotionally do, be forthright about that from the start.<br />Your partner may need to find an additional source of home care, and it would be kind to help them in that search. Your boundaries can only be adhered to if you check in with yourself to discern them, then clearly state them to your partner.<br />The Importance of Continued Self-Care<br />Nothing is more key to caring well for others than caring well for yourself, too. There are idioms about how you can't fill others' cups if your own is empty for precisely that reason!<br />Because your partner will be busy managing living with their condition, it is your own task to set up and stick to your self-care regimen. If you feel comfortable, share your plans with them. It can be beneficial for connection and can help them feel relieved about your wellness.<br />How to Make Time for Yourself<br />Setting aside time for yourself in advance will help you stick to it in the moment. This is best discussed with a partner, especially if they need round-the-clock or frequent care in advance. Set a scheduled time for yourself as often as is feasible and viable for your situation.<br />Sticking to a self-care routine will not only make you a happier person, but it can also help you manage the stress of your relationship. Additionally, the act of regularly taking a break improves your productivity, helps clarify your thinking, and is beneficial for other forms of stress in your life.<br />Compile Self-Care Options<br />Now that you have a set schedule for self-care, you'll want to compile a list of the things you like to do for that. Some self-care activity choices include a massage, seeing friends, or meditating. By crafting a list of what you like best and then scheduling those activities into your schedule in your self-care time slots, you can be assured ahead of time that no matter how stressful any given moment is, relief is on the way.<br />Being a support system for someone else is a valiant thing, but it doesn't mean you need any less support.<br />Being open with your friends, practitioners, and loved ones about what you are experiencing in your relationship will make your self-care all the more advantageous.<br />Regular Check-Ins and Open Communication<br />Once you and your partner are clear about needs, boundaries, and self-care, it will serve your relationship well to check in regularly with one another about how everything is going.<br />Regular check-ins for yourself are also important. Your needs and self-care may need to be adjusted along the way. It is important for you to become aware of those needed changes before it starts to impact your relationship.<br />Changes may need to be made at points, and needs may evolve. Keeping a clear line of communication with your partner about how you are both doing, what is going well, and what feels challenging will help you stay close through this difficult time.<br />Questions<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">1. There is an idiom about saying you can't fill others' cups if your own is empty. What does it mean to you?<br /><br />2. Most caregivers in long-term care families need respite services from time to time to relieve tiredness and stress. How much do you know about respite service? Is there any story to share?<br /><br />3. Couple therapy is very common in western countries. They take this step to honestly and openly talk about the development of their relationship. Do you think it can be applied to our society?<br />Can good use of couple therapy reduce the divorce rate in Taiwan?<br /><br />4. How do you comment a man abandoned his fiancée who was just diagnosed stroke due to ruptured hemangioma?(a real case.)<br />Is he realistic / conscienceless /coward?<br /></span><br /><br />P.S.<br />1.丹堤咖啡有100元低消喔!<br />2.參加三次(含實體及線上會議)後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />3.請帶著開放與熱情來參加全英文會話聚會!</div>
