It’s a fact that money makes the world go round because it can make the impossible possible and the unimaginable real. By Rajyogi Brahmakumar Nikunj<br /><br />CHENNAI: We all love money...don't’ we? It’s a fact that money makes the world go round because it can make the impossible possible and the unimaginable real. Hence, it won’t be an exaggeration to say that money can do almost everything. We all have experienced how money can make people change their moods and colours in a jiffy. Haven’t we? It can close the eyes and mouth of those who may expose the guilty.  Witnesses of crime can turn a blind eye and a deaf ear and maintain a stony silence even though they know the truth. It can help free the guilty and punish the innocent. In the world of business, money is the prime force behind the movers and shakers of mega deals, mergers and breakups. Whether it’s sports, entertainment or any other business, money can make cut-throat competitors get into a co-operative mode in mutual interest. <br />Money can match the mismatched, fix matches, miss goals and change roles. At present, it is observed that money has considerable clout even in matters of faith. Like, it can bring you the choicest blessings of gurus; it can gain you easy access to the holy citadels of godmen who may anoint you as their ardent follower. With money, you can also have a quick darshan of your favourite lord at the temple without having to wait in long queues. The list is unending. In short, money can buy anything and everything under the sun that can be bought. Though money creates this illusion that we are living in paradise yet money cannot do any of the following for us.<br />Money can buy us a beautiful house but not a happy home, it can buy us delicious food and expensive healthcare but not good health, it can provide us with high security but it cannot guarantee even minimum safety, it can buy us countless things for entertainment but not cheer and joy, it can buy us a comfortable bed but not sound sleep, it can buy name and fame but not real respect, it can buy the best contacts and relations but not true and honest love, it can buy crowns and thrones but not real power, it can buy good education but not intelligence and wisdom and lastly it can bail us out from the worst crimes but it cannot help us escape divine justice and buy us liberation from our sins and sufferings.<br />So, even if money does make the world go round, at the end of all the going round we reach nowhere and get nothing substantial and real and end up being more impoverished than ever. However, this does not imply that money has to be shunned totally or that money has no use at all. Nope! Instead, we must understand that money is merely a tool that has to be used wisely and without greed, attachment or selfishness to create happiness for all. Hence, as long as we use it as masters, it will bring us benefit and happiness. As soon as we become slaves of it, it would bring loss and misery. An enlightened person would always use money for the maximum good of maximum number of people, whereas for a spiritually empowered soul, money becomes a tool to create good karma and a good destiny for the self and others. So, the moral of the story is that money has never made man permanently happy, nor will it because there is nothing in its nature to produce happiness. Hence, if we really want to be wealthy and happy, then we should earn blessings which is our real wealth and which will go along with us birth after birth. Think about it.<br /><br />Questions:<br />1.Money makes the world go round because it can make the impossible possible and the unimaginable real. Do you agree with it?<br />2.Money can buy us a beautiful house but not a happy home; delicious food and expensive healthcare but not good health; countless things for entertainment but not cheer and joy etc.. How do you evaluate the importance of money to your life?<br />3.Can we use the least amount of money to make our life happy and healthy? Give us your suggestions or provide us your ideas? <br />4.Have you ever encountered in short of money and made your life difficult? How did you overcome it?<br />5.Do you think how much money we shall prepare for the retirement enabling us to live comfortably and happily? <br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Session II: Seven ways you can financially prepare for a recession<br />If a recession is inevitable, here are some financial moves you can make to prepare<br /><br />Inflation is at a 40-year high. Interest rates are rising. And gas prices have hit a frightening $5 a gallon. The stock market is taking investors on a roller-coaster ride with terrifying drops. Even if you haven’t looked lately, you know that the value of your retirement account is down. Cryptocurrencies are crashing, not surprisingly. And now you’re hearing that we may be in a recession, or one is inevitable. You remember the Great Recession and how harsh it was for so many. So telling you to “calm down” or that “this too shall pass” doesn’t address the anxiety you’re feeling about your financial well-being. It’s OK that you don’t feel things are OK. But you shouldn’t make moves based on recessionary fears that can put you in a worse position financially.<br /><br />Recessions don’t last forever.<br /><br />On average, recessions last 11 months, according to Lindsey Bell, chief markets and money strategist for Ally. The shortest recession was the 2020 pandemic-induced recession, which lasted just three months.<br /><br />Here are seven tips to protect yourself whether a recession is coming. Don’t be afraid of a bear market. You may not even know what a bear market is, but you’re primed to be petrified of one. This week, the S&amp;P 500 index slid into a bear market, defined as a 20 per cent drop from a recent high. According to Anthony Saglimbeni, global markets strategist for Ameriprise Financial, the average duration of a bear market since 1950 is roughly 418 days. “Just shift your view a little bit and look at this as an opportunity if you’re a longer-term investor,” Saglimbene said. He suggested focusing on companies with solid balance sheets, strong cash flow, and products that consumers use and need.<br />Don’t try to time the market. Many folks may want to get out of the stock market or reduce what they’re investing until things get better. That is the definition of trying to time the market. Knowing the best time to get out and when to jump back in is impossible.<br />Get rid of your credit card debt. Now. “Job number one for anyone with a credit card is to pay off their balances as soon as possible,” said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree. “When a recession may be on the way, and interest rates are rising rapidly, it’s even more important.”<br />Stockpile savings. Save while you have the extra money because a recession can quickly change your circumstances. If you don’t have a good emergency fund, consider cancelling a vacation or putting off an expensive renovation project that isn’t necessary.<br />Establish a backup to your emergency fund. In addition to having a recession rainy-day fund, Benz recommends figuring out where you might go for additional funds if you need them in a pinch.<br />Don’t underestimate the power of having bonds in your retirement portfolio. Typically when stocks are down, bonds balance out your stock holdings. But bond prices have been hit as well.<br />Get a side gig. Many employers are begging for workers.<br />There are a record number of job openings, with the unemployment rate at 3.6 per cent. According to the Labour Department, the economy saw job gains in transportation, warehousing, leisure and hospitality, education, health services, and government. <br /><br />Questions: <br />1.Our currency has been depreciated from US$1.- against NT$ 27.5 to NT$32.- and other Asian currencies are the same. Did you buy any foreign currencies for investment or travelling?<br />2.About the investment, do you trust the experts’ advice, consult with your families or get the information from the social medium?<br />3.When the stock market drops dramatically during the recession time, should we keep investment due to the price far much lower or sell it and then put the money in the bank? Which one is much safer? <br />4.We are advised that the recession seems inevitable in the coming year. Did you make any financial preparation? As per the mentioned 7 ways, which one you will choose?<br />5.Do you have experiences to earn money in the stock market or how do you save money for the rainy day? Share us your ideas?</div>
