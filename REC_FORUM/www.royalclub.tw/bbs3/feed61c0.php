<span style="font-weight: bold">Session I: Chinese couples asked to take divorce exam</span><br /><a href="https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1806/180605-china-divorce.html" class="postlink">https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1806/180605-china-divorce.html</a><br /><br />Authorities in China are looking at a new way of halting the country's increasing divorce rate. In parts of China, couples who file for divorce are being asked to take an exam to ascertain how much they still might love each other and whether or not their marriage can be salvaged. Up to half of all Chinese marriages between those who were born in the 1980s have ended in divorce. China's rising divorce rate has been attributed to the increased empowerment of working women, who are more financially independent and less reliant on a partner. Media sources say the rise of social media and dating apps are adding to the problem, as there are increasing numbers of extramarital affairs. <br /><br />The divorce tests have had a mixed reaction in China. Liu Chunling, the director of a marriage registration office, told reporters that the test was aimed at reducing the divorce rate and preventing &quot;impulsive divorces&quot;. She said: &quot;Only the harmony of millions of family units can achieve the harmony of an entire society.&quot; Chinese Internet users were less enthusiastic about the 15-question test being used to determine a couple's love for each other. One post on the Weibo social media site asked: &quot;So if you remember your wedding anniversary you can't divorce? Divorce isn't a case of amnesia.&quot; Another wrote: &quot;They are adults and they have the right to divorce. This is interference in domestic affairs.&quot;<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion:</span><br />1.Do you agree this new policy can decrease the divorce rate?<br />2.Do you think that it is a good idea to prevent &quot;impulsive divorces&quot;? Or do you have any other ideas?<br />3.Do you think that the divorce tests interfere in human rights?<br />4.What factors cause the high divorce rate nowadays?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Session II: Best to learn a new language before age of 10</span><br /><a href="https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1805/180504-language-learning.html" class="postlink">https://breakingnewsenglish.com/1805/180504-language-learning.html</a><br /><br />New research from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) suggests that if people want to achieve native-like proficiency in a new language, they should start learning that language before the age of ten. The researchers added that children up to the age of 17 or 18 remain adept at learning grammar. There is bad news for those who want to pick up a new language beyond their late teens. The researchers say this is past the &quot;critical period&quot; when language-learning ability starts to decline. Researcher Joshua Hartshorne said: &quot;As far as a child is concerned, it's quite easy to become bilingual....That's when you're best at learning languages. It's not really something that you can make up later.&quot;<br /><br />The research was based on an analysis of results from a 10-minute online grammar quiz. Over 670,000 language learners of all ages participated in the test. Researchers measured the grammatical ability of people who started learning a language at different points in their life. Professor Hartshorne focused on grammar rules that were most likely to confuse a non-native speaker as a gauge of that person's proficiency. MIT researcher Josh Tenenbaum suggested people simply might be too busy to learn a language later in life. He said: &quot;After 17 or 18, you leave home, you work full time, or you become a specialized university student. All of these might impact your learning rate for any language.&quot;<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion:</span><br />1.According to the article above, do you agree with it or not?
