It is what you think about it.” ― Dale Carnegie<br /><br />Let’s face it, we all want to be happy.<br /><br />If you didn’t want to be happy you wouldn’t be reading this.<br /><br />You talk about how you want to be happy, but you don’t ever seem to do anything about it.<br /><br />If you want to be happy you don’t need to add more things to our life — you need to give some up.<br /><br />Here is a list of things that you need to give up to create more happiness in your life.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">1.	Give Up On Your Fears</span><br />“Where fear is, happiness is not.” — Lucius Annaeus Seneca<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">2.	Give Up On Your Negative Self-talk</span><br />“Positive thinking and negative thinking cannot operate at the same level in your mind, one needs to be the master and the one you feed it more will rule over the other.” ― Oscar Bimpong<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">3.	Give Up On Your Past</span><br />“Just because someone screwed up your past, it doesn’t mean you should give them permission to screw up your future.” — Zig Ziglar<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">4.	Give Up On Living Other People’s Dreams</span><br />“The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why.” — Mark Twain<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">5.

People are naturally drawn like magnets to those who know who they are and cannot be shaken!”- Mandy Hale<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">6.	Give Up Comparing Yourself to Others</span><br />“No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.” — Eleanor Roosevelt<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">7.	Give Up Negative People</span><br />“You cannot expect to live a positive life if you hang with negative people.” ― Joel Osteen<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Conclusion:</span><br />“Remember: We all get what we tolerate. So stop tolerating excuses within yourself, limiting beliefs of the past, or half-assed (= stupid) or fearful states.” ―Tony Robbins<br /><br />Happiness is a choice.<br /><br />You are in control of your happiness.<br /><br />Every day you get to choose to be happy or not.<br /><br />Quit making excuses.<br /><br />Quit blaming others.<br /><br />Quit blaming your circumstances.<br /><br />It’s time to take responsibility for your own happiness.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion questions:</span><br /><br />1.	Do you agree with the notion that If you want to be happy you don’t need to add more things to your life — you need to give some up? Why or why not?<br /><br />2.	Among the 7 things you should give up to be happy, which one or ones would be on your priority list? Why? <br /><br />3.

A key part of the process is to ask questions that assess how well each candidate scores on <span style="color: #FF0000"><span style="font-weight: bold">Amazon’s 14 Leadership Principles.</span></span> I’ve listed the principles below, edited for brevity:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">1.	Customer obsession</span><br />Leaders start with the customer and work backward. They pay attention to competitors but obsess over customers.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">2.	Ownership</span><br />Leaders are owners. They act beyond just their own team and never say “that’s not my job.”<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">3.	Invent and simplify</span><br />Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams, and always find ways to simplify. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">4.	Are right, a lot</span><br />Leaders have strong judgment and good instincts. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">5.	Learn and be curious</span><br />Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They’re curious.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">6.	Hire and develop the best</span><br />They recognize exceptional talent and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">7.	Insist on the highest standards</span><br />Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high-quality products, services, and processes.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">8.	Think big</span><br />Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">9.	Bias for action</span><br />Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">10.	Frugality</span><br />Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">11.	Earn trust</span><br />Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">12.	Dive deep</span><br />Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">13.	Have backbone; disagree and commit</span><br />Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">14.	Deliver results</span><br />Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion questions:</span><br /><br />1.	Why set the bar high so important to Amazon’s success when it comes to its hiring process?<br /><br />2.	Is setting the bar high a good thing or bad thing when it comes to your life goals or dealing with important things?<br /><br />3.	If you were the CEO of a company, which ones of these 14 leadership principles do you think would be the most important factors to your company’s success? Why?<br /><br />4.	In your opinion, what are the best qualities of a great leader?<br /><br />5.	You are the CEO of your life. Do you think you can apply some of these 14 leadership principles to your life? Please share your thoughts?<br /><br />6.	Are there any words of wisdom or quotes from famous people (or someone you admire) that have ever inspired you?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Suggested Agenda</span><br />7:00 p.m. --7:30 p.m. free talk <br />7:30 p.m. --8:10 p.m. first topic discussion <br />8:10 p.m. --8:20 p.m. Presentation <br />8:20 p.m.-- 8:40 p.m. Sharing time : articles &amp; other experiences. <br />8:40 p.m.-- 9.:15 p.m. second topic discussion <br />9:15 p.m.-- 9:30 p.m. Presentation<br />speaker time : 2 minutes for each speaker<br />host time : 3 minutes<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The meeting place of Thursday:</span><br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第三區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
