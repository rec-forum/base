This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Rob.<br />Beth<br />And I’m Beth.<br />Rob<br />In this programme, we’re talking about money – and Beth, as the old saying goes, money makes the world go round!<br />Beth<br />You mean it’s very important and lots of things couldn’t happen without it. Well, we all need money – but have you noticed how our money doesn’t seem to buy so much these days?<br />Rob<br />Yes, I have Beth. It seems like consumers like us are being hit in the pocket at the moment – and by that, I mean we have less money to spend.<br />Beth<br />Now, I’m no economist, but I know this has a lot to do with inflation - the increase in prices of things over time.<br />Rob<br />It’s a big problem globally, and Beth my question for you is about inflation. According to one report, what was the annual inflation rate in Venezuela between November 2017 and 2018? Was it:<br />a)    130%<br />b)    1,300% or<br />c)    1,300,000%?<br />Beth<br />I’ll say b) 1,300%<br />Rob<br />OK. We’ll find out if you’re right later on. But let’s talk more about money and inflation now. Around the world, prices of things are rising more than normal, and more worrying is that prices keep going up.<br />Beth<br />Two things in particular are increasing in price – energy, like gas and electricity, and food. These are things we need and depend on. So, what’s causing the rises?<br />Rob<br />There seem to be two main reasons – the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine, which has reduced the supply in things we need. And when things are in short supply – available in limited quantities - prices go up.<br />Beth<br />The BBC World Service programme The Real Story discussed this in much more detail. One expert, economist, writer and broadcaster, Linda Yueh, explained how price rises could be around for a while…<br />Linda Yueh, economist, writer and broadcaster<br />Even if you take out some of these volatile items like food and energy, the sustained price increases we've had, it is actually getting passed through into how companies price their goods and services. and that's where it gets extremely worrying because that suggests that even if energy prices, food prices, come down, we could have inflation now in the system and I think that for advanced economies is worrying, for developing countries, that's hugely worrying.<br />Rob<br />Linda Yueh used some interesting language there. She talked about food and energy being volatile items – something that is volatile is unpredictable and can change suddenly. And that’s what we’ve experienced with food and energy prices.<br />Beth<br />Yes, and she said these price increases have been sustained – so, continuing at the same level for a long period of time. But Linda Yueh says that even if energy and food prices eventually come down, companies will pass on the extra costs they have already faced by charging more for their goods and services.<br />Rob<br />And this could cause inflation – there’s that word again. Continuing price rises aren’t good for anyone but especially for people in developing economies – countries which have industry that’s less developed and have lower living standards.<br />Beth<br />Another possible consequence of inflation is recession – this economic term describes a situation where a country’s production starts going down, people’s incomes go down and unemployment goes up. This all sounds like a very bleak economic outlook. So, what can be done?<br />Rob<br />Well, that’s the million-dollar question, and economists are trying to work it out. Speaking on The Real Story programme, economist Vicky Pryce gave an overview of how to control inflation.<br /><br />Vicky Pryce, economist<br />One of them, something that is actually most effective, is by slowing down demand. And if you increase interest rates, what you do is you discourage people from borrowing, whether they are individuals or whether they are businesses - and of course the economy starts slowing down.<br />Rob<br />So, she says what is most effective – meaning what works well and gets the best results – is slowing down demand. Increasing interest rates can do this because people will borrow less money. Interest rates are fees banks and financial institutions charge you for borrowing money.<br />Beth<br />And if we borrow less money, we buy fewer things, which can reduce inflation. I think it makes sense now! And if you were in Venezuela in 2018, you would really want inflation to go down, wouldn’t you?<br />Rob<br />Yes. Now, earlier I asked you what one report said the inflation rate was there between November 2017 and 2018.<br />Beth<br />And I said a very high 1,300%.<br />Rob<br />Well, it was even higher, Beth. According to a study by the opposition-controlled National Assembly, the annual inflation rate reached 1,300,000% in the 12 months to November 2018. This extreme financial situation was known as hyperinflation.<br />Beth<br />That’s not good at all. In this programme, we have been talking about inflation – that’s the increase in prices over time.<br />Rob<br />Other vocabulary we used included the expression hit in the pocket – which means you have less money to spend.<br />Beth<br />Volatile describes something that is unpredictable and can change suddenly.<br />Rob<br />Something that is sustained continues at the same level for a long period of time. And something that is effective works well and gets the best results.<br />Beth<br />And interest rates are fees banks and financial institutions charge you for borrowing money.<br />Rob<br />Well, we hope you’ve found our brief lesson about the economy useful. Thanks for listening. Goodbye for now!<br />Beth<br />Bye bye!<br /><br />Q1. How is inflation in Taiwan? Which prices of things are rising more?<br />Q2. Which things affect you more about rising prices?<br />Q3. In response to inflation how do you face it, what is your strategy for rising prices and how do you cut your expenses?<br />Q4. Between the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine, which causes more inflation?<br />Q5. What do you think about the government's handling of inflation? <br /><br />Session II:<br />Taiwan to Make Military Service Extension Announcement This Year<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-06/taiwan-to-make-military-service-extension-announcement-this-year">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles ... -this-year</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Taiwan will make an announcement on extending its four-month military conscription requirement by the end of this year, Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng said, in the latest sign Taipei is taking a potential war threat from China more seriously.<br /><br />Any change to military service would come with a one-year notice period, Chiu told lawmakers in Taipei on Wednesday, noting that the ministry was still seeking opinions from various departments.<br /><br />“Insufficient manpower in the military is one of the reasons for extending military service,” Chiu said Wednesday. “Four months of service is not enough as threats from the enemy are now severe.”<br /><br />Chiu said the government was still weighing exactly how long to make military service, declining to answer lawmakers’ questions on whether a one- or two-year requirement was most likely. Currently, all Taiwanese men over 18 must serve four months in the military.<br /><br />The timeframe Chiu outlined could delay a decision on conscription until after November’s local elections, seen as a mid-term test for President Tsai Ing-wen ahead of a presidential vote in 2024. Extending military service is an unpopular idea among many young Taiwanese, most of whom support Tsai’s Democratic Progressive Party. <br /><br />Taiwan is trying to bolster its combat readiness in the wake of increased military pressure from Beijing after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s August visit to the island the Communist Party considers its territory. China responded with unprecedented military drills that eroded a decades-old buffer zone around Taiwan.<br /><br />Tsai told the Global Taiwan Institute Annual Symposium on Wednesday that China’s “persistent” military activity in recent months had threatened peace in the Taiwan Strait. “We are working to adapt our defense strategy to the changing threats,” she said.<br /><br />Taiwan will now treat any People’s Liberation Army incursion into the island’s airspace as a “first strike,” Chiu told lawmakers Wednesday, after a recent spate of closer flights by Chinese warplanes and drones. So far, Chinese military aircraft and warships have kept well outside the smaller 12-nautical-mile (22 kilometer) area that Taiwan regards as defining its territorial sea and airspace. <br /><br />Taiwan is set to be a core issue at the twice-a-decade congress of China’s ruling Communist Party, scheduled to begin Oct 16. Chinese President Xi Jinping is widely expected to secure a third term in power, and could face greater pressure to bring Taiwan under Beijing’s rule, as part of a longer-term goal of national rejuvenation.<br /><br />Q1. How seriously is Taiwan taking a potential war threat from China?<br />Q2. Is it necessary to extend military service? Why or why not?<br />Q3 How long shall we make military service? Which do you think a one or a two-year requirement is most likely?<br />Q4. What do you think about young men having to serve in the military? Do you have any experience or story about military life to share?<br /> <br />P.S.<br />1.參加三次(含實體及線上會議)後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />2.請帶著開放的心與熱情來參加全英文會話聚會!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=89">AndrewWang</a> — Sat Oct 22, 2022 10:45 pm</p><hr />
