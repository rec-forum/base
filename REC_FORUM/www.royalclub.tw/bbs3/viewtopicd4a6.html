			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">How Can You Change Somebody's Opinion?</span><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/57925?ref=translated">https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/57925?ref=translated</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Do you ever get into an argument where you know you're right, and yet even with your eloquent explanation and all of the facts on your side, you just can't get through? Is there a strategic way to successfully convince somebody and change their opinion? The first and most disappointing thing that you have to come to terms with is this: Facts don't convince people. Especially if they already have an opinion. We all like to think that information or indisputable studies would convince us in an argument, but study after study shows that when certain facts don't conform to our beliefs, our brains are happy to disregard or simply rationalize them away. In one study, scientists ask people if they believe in man-made climate change, and then categorize them as believers or deniers. They then told some that scientist have reevaluated the data and concluded that predictions for the future were much worse than before. While some others were told the situation wasn't nearly as bad as once thought. But these facts had an interesting result on their beliefs. People who didn't believe in climate change and were told that things would be much worse completely ignored this fact, and their opinions were unchanged. <br />   But if they were told that things weren't nearly as bad, their beliefs moved much farther in that direction. And the same thing happened to those who believed strongly in climate change. When told that things are now predicted to be worse, they shifted their opinions more strongly in that direction, whereas those told it wouldn't be so bad didn't change their opinions at all. The facts only caused people to polarize. It turns out that once formed, people's impressions and opinions are extremely perseverant. <br />    And cognitive scientists say much of this is actually linked to our ability as humans to cooperate. A skill that no other animals have. To the degree that humans do, from hunting and gathering to agriculture and modern computers, our cooperation allows us to rely on one another's expertise instead of knowing everything. As a result, we can hardly tell where our own understanding ends and another begins. Ultimately, strong beliefs don't actually come from deep understanding. This is known as the &quot;Illusion of Explanatory Depth.&quot; If I asked you to rate your understanding of something like a toilet, zippers, or computers, chances are you believe you know way more than you actually do. Go on and try to explain step by step how a toilet or a zipper functions in detail. Sometimes this simple act can expose how baseless ours or others opinion is. In one study, when participants were asked to rate their opinions of public policies like healthcare, and then later asked to explain in as much detail as possible the impact of implementing those policies. They would quickly turn down the intensity of their beliefs having been exposed to their own ignorance. How else can we overcome these tendencies and convince people in an argument? It turns out that we need to focus on the common motive as per by Tali Sharot, a cognitive neural scientist, that is, focus on the motives and things that you can agree on. One study looking at parents afraid to vaccinate their children because of the fear of autism found that if they simply told them the facts, that the science shows there is no link between the two, they wouldn't listen. But when they focused on the common goal of protecting their children, and explained what vaccines are meant to prevent, things like measles, mumps, polio, tetanus, and how those diseases impact children who get them without even mentioning autism, they were more likely to have their kids vaccinated after. Finally, humans are known to have something called an in-group and out-group bias. We tend to be skeptical of outsiders or people who we see as different from us. This can come in the form of race, religion, physical traits, gender, but also in the form of ideas. So people who don't share your ideas are part of your out-group. Studies have been done to show that if you can find a way to relate to people and have them see you in a different light to see you as a part of their in-group, they're much more likely to listen to you than if they think you're nothing like them. Find the group that you're both part of, and use that as a point of personal connection. <br /><br />Question<br />1.	Are you a person who likes to persuade to others? Or always be persuaded? <br />2.	Take an example, you changed somebody mind finally.<br />3.	According to our article’’ focus on common motive’’ is a way to change somebody opinion, do you have another good way for us? <br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">When to Commit, When to Quit: 2 Strategies to Figure It Out</span><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/20504?ref=translated">https://tw.voicetube.com/videos/20504?ref=translated</a><!-- m --><br /><br />    “Hi Marie, how do I know when the obstacles are just part of the game or it's just too hard? You have to be pushed sometimes, right? But how do I know when it’s the right time to push and recommit or if it’s just time to give up and quit? Thank you so much, Giuliana.” Giuliana, this is a big, juicy question and the truth is, there are so many factors that make every situation unique. Sometimes the smart thing to do is to quit. We’ll talk about that in a minute. But other times you gotta dig deeper and recommit. While I don't have all the answers, I do have some tips that will help you find yours. First thing is that quitters do win. You know that old saying that quitters never win and winners never quit? Total BS. It’s just not true. To stay with something just because you’re afraid of feeling like or looking like a loser is not a smart strategy. So I want to give you a reframe. It’s called the power of positive quitting. This is what happens when you realize that you’ve gone as far as you can go with a particular project and it’s actually not smart to keep going. You should cut your losses and redirect your time and your resources into a new direction. <br />So let me give you an example from my own life. A few years ago I spent a lot of time and money and energy building this beautiful custom online membership forum. So it was going great, it was awesome. We had opened up the membership, a lot of people paid us, and they came in, and guess what happened? The whole thing friggin’ crashed and burned. It was a nightmare. Now uh, what I did is took a look and said, “Ok, all this money and time and energy I spent? I’m pulling the plug We’re getting out of here.” So of course I took care of my customers, we changed platforms, everything was fine, but the point is I took a look at it and I said, “This is the right thing to quit because I’m not gonna win going any further.” So I 86-ed that whole thing, which brings me to my next point. <br />Number two, you gotta fork over the freedom fee. So here’s what I mean by this. Sometimes we’ve got a lot of money or time or ego invested in the project and we feel like there’s a ton of sunk costs and we don't wanna let it go. I get it. But you’ve gotta reframe that. Just like when you’re trying to switch cell phone companies and they make you pay that big fee to get out. That’s what it’s like sometimes with a project. If you start to think about just letting this thing go and you get all kinds of mental and emotional bandwidth, it’s gonna make it a lot easier to eat those costs. <br />Number three, hard happens. Look, things in life get hard. I mean, we can all agree on that. Right? (-Oh yeah~ -Hands up!) But seriously, do not get caught up in the myth of flow. Yes, sometimes things do flow but not always. Very often, you know what? Things do get hard. So don't believe anybody when they tell you, “Oh, if it’s really right for you, it’s so easy and it flows and it just… it’s a natural unfolding of your you-ness.” Natural unfolding my badonkadonk. You know what unfolds naturally? A bath towel. Kind of. So I’ve had lots of projects that are totally worthwhile and you know what? Hard things actually pop up. So when that happens for me, I realize I gotta dig in deeper and push through. Sometimes it means I take a little break or sometimes it means I change my approach. But the point here is, obstacles don't mean you should quit. Sometimes you’ve really got to push through. Now, I know in this whole question we still haven’t helped you decide whether or not you should quit or commit, so here are two strategies that’ll help you find clarity.<br /> First up, the 10 year test. Now, we’ve talked about this before on MarieTV, but we’re repeating it because it works. I want you to ask yourself, 10 years in the future will you regret quitting this project right now? So going back to my example, when that website crashed and burned I asked myself, “Am I gonna regret 10 years from now just giving this whole thing up?” Not at all. It was one project, it taught me a lot, but that was it. I wasn’t gonna cry over it. So that’s the same thing I want you to do. I want you to recognize whether or not this project or whatever you’re working on, is it a true soul goal or is it just something on your journey that’s taking you to something bigger? So Giuliana, get connected. Really ask yourself, how will you feel in 10 years? Tap into your heart and really pay attention to how you feel. This isn’t just a useful test, it’s actually a tweetable. “Your feelings will guide you if you have the courage to tap into them and listen.” <br /><br />Second you want to ask for guidance. So whether you meditate or you pray or you have another spiritual practice, the point is you’ve gotta plug into a higher power. Ask for some help. I do this all the time and it is amazing. You’ve gotta be open though to receiving the signs. So maybe that looks like an email or maybe a call from a friend or maybe you’ll get an intuitive flash, but the point is if you don't ask you will not receive. <br />So, Giuliana, these are all the things that work for me. I know it’s a big, hairy topic, there’s a lot of things to consider, but if you want another resource you might want to consider checking out Seth Godin’s book The Dip. It’s all about how to figure out when to quit and when to commit. So that was my A to your Q, I really hope it helps. <br />Question:<br />1. Have you ever struggled with when to commit and when to quit? And if so, what helped you decide?<br />2. No matter how you decided it, the time cannot back to the past. Have you ever regretted it? <br /><br />3. Any tips to share us after reading the article.<br /><br /><br />Saturday's meeting place:<br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />tel: 2255-8132<br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
