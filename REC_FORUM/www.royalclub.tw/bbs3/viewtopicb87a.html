From the following comparison, we’re going to begin our discussion from some representative aspects, including the emphasis, working style, way of learning, assessment, extra curricular and family education. Continue reading and share your ideas with Top China Travel.<br /><br />1.Emphasis: Memorization vs Innovation<br />Rote learning plays an important role in Chinese education system, with the distinctive emphasis on memorization. For most subjects, usually the teachers will give lectures and ask the students to write down the notes, sometimes the students have to recite the words and texts after class. Speaking of homework, copying new words is more common for Chinese and English classes, rather than practical activity. And this is the reason why Chinese students learn English for many years but have problem in the real communication.<br /> <br />Problem solving and case study are often involved in western schools, instead of note-taking and repetition. Western classes offer more room for discussion and practice, so that they could apply what they’ve learned to real situation, rather than on the paperwork. The western teaching method is way more innovative,<br /><br /> <br />2.Working Style: Collaboratively vs Independently<br />Chinese students are good at group working, and it has a lot to do with the traditional Chinese culture of collectivism. Under the Chinese education system, students are collective-oriented, and tend to work hard and give back to the family and society in the future. For group work, the success of the group is more important than individual achievements.<br /><br />In western education, independent thinking is highly valued, even when it comes to group work. Students are encouraged to be more creative, so they have more opportunities to express themselves. Meanwhile, western students are expected to get each of them involved in the learning process, and make progress together.<br /><br /> <br />3.Way of Learning: Teacher Guided vs Student Led<br />When mentioning the way of learning, the most obvious characteristic of Chinese education must be the teacher-guided learning style among most Chinese schools. It’s a rude way to disagree with teachers, or challenge them. In recent years, even though student-oriented method is suggested, the class is still led by the teacher.<br /> <br />Way of learning in the western schools is just on the contrary. Discussion is more common than lecture from the teacher, and students are encouraged to challenge the teacher if they have different opinions. The class is not driven by the teacher, but the student.<br /><br /> <br />4.Assessment: Test Scores vs Coursework Marks<br />Assessment in Chinese schools is all about exams. Believe or not, grade is the most effective way to assess a student’s performance at school, according to the Chinese education system. No matter teachers, parents or students, exam score is their biggest concern, because only if the students get good scores, they could go to an ideal university and have a brighter future.<br /><br />But in western education, test score and coursework mark are both valued. When it comes to university entrance, there are other requirements, rather than exam score only, which is really different from the college entrance examination in China (“Gaokao”).<br /><br /> <br />5.Extracurricular Class: For the Test vs Based on Interests<br />Chinese students work really hard for a good test result, they start learning in the early morning and finish late at night. A lot of students in China take extracurricular classes after school hour, or during weekends and vacations, mostly for boosting the test performance. Some students begin to take extracurricular classes as long as they go to primary school, and continue to high school. In these years, more and more students take extracurricular classes like music, dancing and plenty more activities, for a all-round development.<br /> <br />Unlike the main point of extracurricular class, students in western countries who really struggle the test will take extra class. For others, they take part in classes and activities based on their interests.<br /><br /> <br />6.Family Education: Restrained vs Encouraging<br />Family education in China is restrained. Parents always ask their children to focus on the study, and they expect their children to get good test scores. It seems like study is the most important thing for students, no matter at school or at home. In addition, some Chinese parents seldom give compliments to their children, because they believe that their kids will do better by this way.<br /><br />Western parents prefer an encouraging way, they appraise their children way more frequently than Chinese parents. And test score won’t be their biggest concern.<br /><br /><br />Both Chinese education system and western education system have advantages and disadvantages, which may shape different personalities of the students. The biggest reason is the cultural differences between Chinese and western countries, so that we should know that the most important point is to learn from one side to the other.<br /><br /><br />Questions:<br />1.	Although this article says Both Chinese education system and western education system have advantages and disadvantages, generally speaking people in Taiwan consider western education system and culture is more positive. What kind of advantages do you think the Chinese education still has?<br />2.	Taiwan government has implemented educational reforms since years. There are more and more accesses to the university instead of our old way: one united examination or like 高考 in China as the only criteria to decide the admission by the college. Do our children benefit from it? Does it cause new issues?<br />3.	Taiwan’s education is often criticized as lecturing led by examination. What if we don’t sheer rely on examination, but have some coursework measurements, ex. case study and report? What is the standard to tell high and low scores?<br />4.	Do you think it’s possible we can implant western educational system into Taiwan? Why and why not?<br />5.	Do you think it’s wise to generally upgrade Institute of Technology （技術學院）into University of Science and Technology（科技大學）? What is its benefit for those students in technical and vocational education？<br /><br />Session 2: English Novel Reading<br />Little Woman (by Louisa May Alcott, quoted from Chapter 3, &quot;The Laurence Boy&quot;)<br /><br />(No Weblink, this is cited from the book.)<br /><br />(Just for reference: For those who are not familiar with this English Novel &quot;Little Women&quot;, you can find your time to watch the American film publish in 2019. This is the 5th film version ever since 1933. It used to be translated as 小婦人 but this time this version has a new name in Taiwan: 她們. Now you can find it on Netflix, too. In the beginning of the film you can find this plot.)<br /><br />(Scenario: in a dancing party)<br />Jo saw a big red headed youth approaching her corner, and fearing he meant to engage her, she slipped into a curtained recess, intending to peep and enjoy herself in peace. Unfortunately, another bashful person had chosen the same refuge, for, as the curtain fell behind her, she found herself face to face with the 'Laurence boy'. <br />&quot;Dear me, I didn't know anyone was here!&quot; stammered Jo, preparing to back out as speedily as she had bounced in. <br />But the boy laughed and said pleasantly, though he looked a little startled, &quot;Don't mind me, stay if you like.&quot; <br />&quot;Shan't I disturb you?&quot; <br />&quot;Not a bit. I only came here because I don't know many people and felt rather strange at first, you know.&quot; <br />&quot;So did I. Don't go away, please, unless you'd rather.&quot; <br />The boy sat down again and looked at his pumps, till Jo said, trying to be polite and easy, &quot;I think I've had the pleasure of seeing you before. You live near us, don't you?&quot; <br />&quot;Next door.&quot; And he looked up and laughed outright, for Jo's prim manner was rather funny when he remembered how they had chatted about cricket when he brought the cat home. <br />That put Jo at her ease and she laughed too, as she said, in her heartiest way, &quot;We did have such a good time over your nice Christmas present.&quot; <br />&quot;Grandpa sent it.&quot; <br />&quot;But you put it into his head, didn't you, now?&quot; <br />&quot;How is your cat, Miss March?&quot; asked the boy, trying to look sober while his black eyes shone with fun. <br />&quot;Nicely, thank you, Mr. Laurence. But I am not Miss March, I'm only Jo,&quot; returned the young lady. <br />&quot;I'm not Mr. Laurence, I'm only Laurie.&quot; <br />&quot;Laurie Laurence, what an odd name.&quot; <br />&quot;My first name is Theodore, but I don't like it, for the fellows called me Dora, so I made them say Laurie instead.&quot; <br />&quot;I hate my name, too, so sentimental! I wish every one would say Jo instead of Josephine. How did you make the boys stop calling you Dora?&quot; <br />&quot;I thrashed 'em.&quot; <br />&quot;I can't thrash Aunt March, so I suppose I shall have to bear it.&quot; And Jo resigned herself with a sigh. <br />&quot;Don't you like to dance, Miss Jo?&quot; asked Laurie, looking as if he thought the name suited her. <br />&quot;I like it well enough if there is plenty of room, and everyone is lively. In a place like this I'm sure to upset something, tread on people's toes, or do something dreadful, so I keep out of mischief and let Meg sail about. Don't you dance?&quot; <br />&quot;Sometimes. You see I've been abroad a good many years, and haven't been into company enough yet to know how you do things here.&quot; <br />&quot;Abroad!&quot; cried Jo. &quot;Oh, tell me about it! I love dearly to hear people describe their travels.&quot; <br />Laurie didn't seem to know where to begin, but Jo's eager questions soon set <br />him going, and he told her how he had been at school in Vevay, where the boys never wore hats and had a fleet of boats on the lake, and for holiday fun went on walking trips about Switzerland with their teachers. <br />&quot;Don't I wish I'd been there!&quot; cried Jo. &quot;Did you go to Paris?&quot; &quot;We spent last winter there.&quot; &quot;Can you talk French?&quot; &quot;We were not allowed to speak anything else at Vevay.&quot; <br />&quot;Do say some! I can read it, but can't pronounce.&quot; <br />&quot;Quel nom a cette jeune demoiselle en les pantoufles jolis?&quot; <br />&quot;How nicely you do it! Let me see ... you said, 'Who is the young lady in the pretty slippers', didn't you?&quot; <br />&quot;Oui, mademoiselle.&quot; <br />&quot;It's my sister Margaret, and you knew it was! Do you think she is pretty?&quot; <br />&quot;Yes, she makes me think of the German girls, she looks so fresh and quiet, and dances like a lady.&quot; <br />Jo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her sister, and stored it up to repeat to Meg. Both peeped and criticized and chatted till they felt like old acquaintances. Laurie's bashfulness soon wore off, for Jo's gentlemanly demeanor amused and set him at his ease, and Jo was her merry self again, because her dress was forgotten and nobody lifted their eyebrows at her. She liked the 'Laurence boy' better than ever and took several good looks at him, so that she might describe him to the girls, for they had no brothers, very few male cousins, and boys were almost unknown creatures to them.<br /><br /> <br />Questions:<br />1.	What is this briefly quoted section telling about? If you read this novel or watched the film/TV before, how do you like it?<br />2.	Do you like to read novels? What kind of novels (Romance, History, Biography, Science Fiction, Adventure, Horror…etc.)? Do you enjoy reading translated novels?<br />3.	Which translated English novels have you read before? How do you find the plots and the translation?<br />4.     Do you think it helps English learning? How?<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">P.S.<br />1.因聚會地點是在咖啡店內，所以有低消80元喔。<br />2.參加三次後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />3.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~</span></div>
