For the greatest chance for success, put forth the effort to find the best match for you and your family.<br /><br />Purebred dogs<br />  Over hundreds of years, the selective breeding of dogs with certain traits developed types of dogs that are predictable in their physical characteristics, behaviors and personality traits. Predictability is the major advantage of getting a purebred dog over a mixed-breed. Predictability and dependability are important because there are usually fewer chances of surprises related to their size, physical characteristics, behaviors and personality traits.<br /><br />A good match<br />  The best chance for a successful match is finding a dog or puppy that will fit in with your lifestyle, activity level and living conditions. If they match is not good, expectations can become disappointments and lead to unfortunate circumstances. In the worst case, the dog will be relinquished to a shelter.<br /><br />Responsible purebred dog breeders<br />  Responsible breeders should be educated and accountable for their breed’s health status and adhere to recommended health tests.<br />A responsible breeder will ask you important questions about your lifestyle, living conditions and expectations. They may not have a puppy or dog for you at that moment, which can signify that they breed very selectively for quality and not quantity.<br /><br />The best rescue dog<br />  If you prefer to rescue a dog from a shelter, you still need to be honest with the shelter staff about your lifestyle, living conditions and expectations. A good shelter also wants to get the best possible match for their puppies and dogs. This is especially important when getting a young mixed –breed puppy or an older dog with their own history. It’s important to understand why they end up in the shelter so that you can make an informed decision, and if necessary, take steps to resolve any challenges the dog may have.<br /><br />The bottom line<br />  Do your homework. That way, you will have the greatest chance of getting the best match and a loving companion for you and your family for life.<br /><br />(Cited from StudioClassroom, Advanced, May 2022 p.43)<br /><br />Questions<br />1.	Do you or did you have pets? What is/was it? What is the main reason for you to keep a pat? If not, why don’t you want it?<br />2.	If someday you want to have a puppy as a pet, what kind of dog would you like to have?<br />3.	Pets are not only for our company, but should be treated as a member of the family. What are our daily jobs to keep pets?<br />4.	Stray dogs live miserable livings, especially those abandoned by human. Can you think of any solutions to regulate the adoption and purchasing of dogs and cats? Should cats and dogs be registered with an ID and implanted with chip so as to deter malicious abandoning?<br /><br /><br /><br />Session 2<br />Why Google has bought into “biophilic（親自然的）” design and why you should too?<br /><br />Some of the biggest and most successful companies are opening new office, and their trendiest features is focused on plants and bugs.<br /><br />The future of office space?<br />  Take Amazon as an example. When the e-commerce behemoth opened a new Seattle headquarters a few years back, what design feature did it trumpet loudest to the media? A dome filled with no less than 40,000 plants.<br />  Now Google is getting in on the act too. Its new giant New York campus, housed in a former fright facility, will be “biophilic.” That means employees will share their workspace with acres of gardens, as well as the birds, bees and caterpillars they’ve been specially designed to attract.<br /><br />What’s the goal?<br />  This style of design sounds like it might be pretty and good for the city and the planet. But that hardly seems like enough of a reason for giant corporations to shell out billions of biophilic designs (the price tag for Google’s new NYC sample is $2.1 billion). Instead, both companies are motivated by economics as much as beauty or altruism.<br />  Not only do cool-looking biophilic offices help companies recruit talent in an incredibly tight labor market, but they also nudge that talent to perform better at work once they’re hired. <br />  We’re looking to create workplaces that reduce stress, improve cognitive function and enhance creativity—all of these make our employees healthier, happier and more engaged in their work,” Michele Neptune, a member of Google’s sustainability team told the Financial Times. “It’s something Google believes in, …and it’s something we invest in.”<br /><br />How to apply this to your work place<br />  Of course, the average entrepreneur doesn’t have a spare couple of billion to spend on aviaries and horticulturists. But the good news about biophilic design is that it seems to have benefits at just about any scale. Even just staring at a neighboring green roof for less than a minute has been shown to boost productivity. We do better work when we’re closer to nature. Use that to your advantage.<br /><br />(Cited from StudioClassroom, Advanced, May 2022 p.24)<br /><br />Questions<br />1.	Do you like to work in a “Biophilic” office, like the headquarters of Amazon and Google introduced in this article?<br />2.	Do you believe it increases efficiency/creativity and reduce stress working in this kind of biophilic workplaces? Even it’s only with some plants decorating the working spaces?<br />3.	What were the working environments you used to work at? Do you like it?<br />4.	If you were a boss, what sort of mental/physical environment do you want to create for your employees?<br /><br />P.S.<br />1.參加三次(含實體及線上會議)後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />2.請帶著開放的心與熱情來參加全英文會話聚會!</div>
