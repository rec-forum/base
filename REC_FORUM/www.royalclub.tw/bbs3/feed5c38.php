01/05(Sat.) The weird phobia &amp; Mixology (Host:Ryan)<br /><br />Article I :The weird phobia <br /><br />A phobia is a type of anxiety disorder that causes an individual to experience extreme, irrational fear about a situation, living creature, place, or object. <br />When a person has a phobia, they will often shape their lives to avoid what they consider to be dangerous. The imagined threat is greater than any actual threat posed by the cause of terror. <br />Phobias are diagnosable mental disorders. <br />The person will experience intense distress when faced with the source of their phobia. This can prevent them from functioning normally and sometimes leads to panic attacks. <br />In the United States, approximately 19 million people have phobias. <br />1. Aerophobia, or the fear of flying, may be associated with numerous other phobias, but sometimes it appears on its own. The fear of flying is estimated to affect as many as one in three people, although a full-blown phobia is significantly less common. Travel delays, common when flying at popular times, can make the fear of flying worse. Whether or not your fear of flying has developed into a phobia, it can have devastating effects on your quality of life. <br />2. What is coulrophobia? <br />Since it is not an old phobia, but one that increased in recent decades, little is known about coulrophobia. <br />Scientists and doctors now agree that it is a result of not knowing who lies behind the excessive makeup, red nose and hair color. <br />The clown wears a colorful makeup to deconstruct the facial features to create a new identity. <br />And clowns can also break social norms, their mask makes them able to do things that others can’t do socially, like interacting with unknown people at ease. <br />Some researchers believe that coulrophobia cases increased after the 90’s, when Steven Spielberg classic horror film “IT” depicting a murderous clown was released and the portrayal of Joker as an evil character in Batman movies did not help the matter either. <br />Pupaphobia <br />is the fear of puppets. The origin comes from the Latin word pupillo (meaning puppet) and phobia is Greek (meaning fear). Pupaphobia is considered to be a specific phobia, which is discussed on the home page. Pupaphobia is also related to Automatonophobia (fear of ventriloquist's dummies, animatronic creatures, wax statues or anything that represents a being that appears to have feelings or perceptions). <br />Odontophobia is the fear of teeth or dental surgery. The origin of the word odonto is Greek (meaning tooth) and phobia is Greek (meaning fear). Odontophobia is considered to be a specific phobia, which is discussed on the home page. Odontophobia is also related Dentophobia (Fear of dentists). <br />Nosocomephobia is the extreme fear of hospitals. It is a fairly common phobia; many people (including US President Richard Nixon) are known to suffer from it <br />What is Chronomentrophobia? <br /><br />Chronomentrophobia is the fear of clocks or watches. The origin of the word chrono is Greek (meaning time), ment is Latin (meaning means of) and phobia is Greek (meaning fear). Chronomentrophobia is considered to be a specific phobia, which is discussed on the home page. Chronomentrophobia is also related to Chronophobia (fear of time). <br /><br />Discussion <br />1.Do you want to have any phobia the article mentioned? Why? <br />2.If you have magic power, which one in the royal club you prefer to let him/her to get anyphobia we mentioned <br />3.If you are the god of phobia , what kind of phobia would you want to create? <br />4.If your kids get all phobia the article mentioned, what would you do? <br /><br /><br /><br />Article II :Mixology <br />The word mixologist is often associated with high class lounges and bars and a bartender in more of a dive bar setting. However, in both professions that is not necessarily the case. Although both very important for a great bar experience, the professions actually refers to different roles in the night life scene. <br />THE MIXOLOGIST <br />A mixologist is a cocktail designer that serves seasonal and/or establishment signature drinks and prepares own house-made syrups, bitters, essences or other ingredients that a bartender will need in order to provide a service to a customer. These tasks are always done before the guests arrive. He also selects high quality ingredients that are stocked behind the bar and usually aligned with the style of the bar or restaurant. <br />THE BARTENDER <br />A bartender is completely focused on his guests, makes them feel welcome, entertains them and attends to them when needed. Almost like a friend or companion. He makes great drinks for his guests by using the recipes and ingredients prepared by the mixologist. <br /><br /><br />Discussion <br />1.How often do you drink cocktail <br />2.do you guys love honny drink? <br />3.what do you think the department of mixology ? <br />4.does drink good or not?<br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00-7:30 free talk<br />(Session 1)<br />7:30-7:35 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />7:35~ 8:15 discussion session (40 mins)<br />(Session 2)<br />8:15 ~9:00pm discussion session (45 mins)<br />9:00~9:30 free talk<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12531">Danny Lin</a> — Thu Jan 03, 2019 1:55 am</p><hr />
