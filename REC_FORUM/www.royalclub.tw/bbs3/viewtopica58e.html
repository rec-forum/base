				<div class="content">My dear Royal friends,<br /><br />Happy Father’s Day in advance. Because no one would like to be a host on Aug. 8, I have to be the one.  This is indeed what a President for.<br />Because it should be a family evening, please spend time with your family first.  However, if you are free, you may come to join our discussions.  I do not think we will have many participants, so I encourage every one to make a 3-5 minute public speaking at Session I.  As for Session II, we will discussing the special father-daugher relationship to celebrate Father’s Day. <br /><br />Session I: Secret to public speaking<br />I have studied several speeches about how to make a great public speaking, and find this one is the most useful to me.  Please watch it and learn from it.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/chris_anderson_teds_secret_to_great_public_speaking?language=zh-tw">https://www.ted.com/talks/chris_anderso ... uage=zh-tw</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The four key tips for a great speech are as follows:<br />1.	Focus on one idea.<br />2.	Give the audience the reason to care.<br />3.	Build the idea with familiar concepts.<br />4.	Make the idea worth spreading.<br /><br />Please prepare a 3-5 minute speech in advance by following the four tips if possible.  You can share any topic with us, observations, concepts, stories, jokes, news, experiences, etc., but please remember to identify your core idea to deliver first. If you have no idea about what to say, here are 169 topics for your reference:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.myspeechclass.com/5-minute-presentation-topics.html">http://www.myspeechclass.com/5-minute-p ... opics.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Questions:<br />1.	Besides Royal meetings, have you ever made public speakings? What is the most unforgettable one for you? And why?<br />2.	What do think about the four tips mentioned in the speech? Are they useful for you?<br />3.	What other tips might be also useful?  Why?<br />4.	If you still have time, please practice your prepared speech to your table members. <br /><br />Session II: 7 Tips for Navigating the Father-Daughter Relationship Through the Years<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.allprodad.com/7-tips-for-navigating-the-father-daughter-relationship-through-the-years/">https://www.allprodad.com/7-tips-for-na ... the-years/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />1. The Newborn and Toddler Years<br />This is not a time off for dads. Your daughter’s mother may be a natural nurturer, but you can nurture your daughter as well. Allow the nurturer in you to come out, as well as being her protector.<br />2. The Pre-K Years<br />Your daughter is a sponge at this age, and is soaking up every word and action she sees. Make sure your words and actions are things you want her to copy, because she will.<br />3. The Elementary Years<br />Start now with engaging in her schooling. Don’t leave it all up to mom. This is the time to create the habit of helping her learn, solve problems, and take on new challenges. It is also the time to have father-daughter dates. It is important to still be affectionate even if she resists.<br />4. The Pre-teen Years<br />Continue what you started during the elementary years. Now you will have to really tune in, and make sure your listening skills are developed. The amount of words will increase, and you’ll want to hear every single one of them. Listening to the big and small things will help build trust and deepen your relationship.<br />5. The Teen Years<br />Be prepared for some separation, but always be willing to listen and engage when needed. Hopefully you can keep your date nights, and you have some neat things you like to do together. These years need steady and consistent guidance.<br />6. The Young Adult Years<br />Shedding your tears is okay and expected when leaving home for the first time. Leaning on everything you’ve shared and taught and experienced will help you to be the trusting dad she knows. Trust her to make right decisions, and be there when she needs you.<br />7. The Adult Years<br />She may be gone, but she is still your baby girl. And you are still her daddy. Realize your role as dad is still important to her, and she’ll need fatherly advice from time to time.<br /><br />Besides, I would like to share with you a touching movie: Interstellar. Although both its space travel story and theory are intriguing, I would like to focus on the touching relationship between the father and the daughter.  If you have extra time, please watch the following two clips:<br />1.What the father promised the daughter before his space travel.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UmRtfP3b8E&amp;t=167s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UmRtfP3b8E&amp;t=167s</a><!-- m --><br />2.What the daugher told to the father when they met after more than 100 years (I think).<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu9U8_H9kRk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu9U8_H9kRk</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Questions:<br />1.	Do you believe daughters were father’s loves in previous life? Why or why not?<br />2.	What is your relationship with your father or daughter? How do you usually celebrate Father’s day?<br />3.	If you have a choice, do you prefer having a daughter or a son? Why? <br />4.	Are you touched by the two clips of the movie, Interstellar?? Which part touches you the most?<br /><br />Suggested Agenda<br />7:00 p.m. --7:30 p.m. free talk <br />7:30 p.m. --8:10 p.m. first topic discussion <br />8:10 p.m. --8:40 p.m. Presentation (All participants are invited, and the presentation time is 3-5 minutes up to the number of participants )<br />8:40 p.m.-- 9.:15 p.m. second topic discussion <br />9:15 p.m.-- 9:30 p.m. Presentation (2 minutes for each speaker)<br />The meeting place of Thursday:<br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第三區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
