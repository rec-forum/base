Article 1 : Pxmart targeted by bomb threat after wage remarks<br /><br />‘LIFE IS TOUGH’:Company president Hsu Chung-jen said young people complain about low wages, but spend beyond their means on trips abroad and phones <br />By Chiu Chun-fu and Jake Chung  /  Staff reporter, with staff writer<br /> <br />Pxmart president Hsu Chung-jen speaks at a news conference in Yilan County on Jan. 11.<br /><br />Authorities yesterday said they were investigating comments posted online allegedly threatening to bomb Pxmart (全聯實業) supermarkets in Taipei City and New Taipei City after the company head made comments about young people spending beyond their means.<br />The police said a post on Thursday afternoon on the Bahamut forum by a netizen named “Left-wing Agent,” which allegedly threatened indiscriminate bombings at Pxmart supermarkets, breached Article 305 of the Criminal Code.<br />“I will blow up anyone who goes to Pxmart,” the comment said.<br />Investigators would track down the author of the post via the IP address and forum registration information, police said, adding that the person responsible would be questioned.<br />The alleged bomb threat was in response to Pxmart Co Ltd president Hsu Chung-jen’s (徐重仁) comments regarding low salaries.<br />Hsu said at a book launch on Thursday that young people complain about low wages, but spend beyond their means on trips abroad, the latest mobile phones and the newest accessories.<br />“Young people like to spend money and are more commonly seen at international airports than their parents’ generation was,” Hsu said.<br />“Everyone wants to spend more, but they should not spend what they do not have,” he said.<br />Hsu said that when he joined the workforce in 1977, he made only NT$9,000 per month and had to balance his salary against a mortgage and daily necessities.<br />While life was tough, “it was a temporary situation, as the boss would give you a raise if you worked hard,” he said.<br />Hsu later posted an apology on Facebook after sparking a backlash among young people.<br />He said he misspoke and his words were not ill-intentioned, but were too didactic — spoken in a tone more appropriate for a father addressing his son.<br />Hsu said the incident led him to reflect whether he — and those of his generation — tend to pass judgement too quickly on the younger generation.<br />Hsu said he hoped to speak less, listen more, and seek to understand the younger generation, adding that maybe his apology would dispel the notion that Taiwanese bosses never admit to error.<br />Hsu’s apology earned favor among netizens, with some jokingly asking for a raise from a Pxmart Facebook group administrator.<br />However, some netizens were not in a forgiving mood.<br />They said that Hsu’s words were like criticizing people in the town square and apologizing in an alley.<br />Meanwhile, Pxmart said that business yesterday was normal and there had not been any impact from Hsu’s comments.<br /><br />Discussion:<br />Q1. What's wrong with Hsu's remark about Taiwanese young people? Do you agree with him or not?<br />Q2. Are you sympathetic towards Taiwanese young people? Why or why not?<br />Q3. Are millennials spoiled by their parents? Why are millennials pessimistic about the future?<br />Q4. If you were Hsu Chung-jen, how would you handle this PR crisis?<br /><br /><br />Article 2 : Promising writer dies at 26 from apparent suicide<br /> <br />From Lin Yi-han (林奕含)'s Facebook page<br />Taipei, April 28 (CNA) Promising writer Lin Yi-han (林奕含), who published a bestselling novel this year about a girl raped by her teacher, died at the age of 26, allegedly by her own hand, authorities said Friday.<br /><br />The Taipei City Fire Department said it received a call on Thursday that a woman had hanged herself in her home in Taipei. It confirmed that the woman was Lin, who had been open about her depression and past attempts to take her own life.<br /><br />The police said a suicide note was found at the scene and initial investigations have ruled out the possibility of foul play.<br /><br />According to a United Daily News report, Lin's husband said the writer had hanged herself in her bedroom and showed no signs of life when he found her.<br /><br />In a statement released Friday on the Facebook page of Lin's publisher Guerrilla Publishing, Lin's father Lin Ping-huang (林炳煌) and mother Lai Chia-fang (賴嘉芳) said what occurred to the protagonist in their daughter's debut novel &quot;Fang Ssu-chi De Chu Lian Le Yuan&quot; (房思琪的初戀樂園 literally, Fang Ssu-chi's First Love Paradise) was actually her own experience.<br /><br />The novel, published in February, is about a young girl named Fang Ssu-chi who was raped by her teacher.<br /><br />Lin's parents said they believed an incident that occurred 8-9 years ago, instead of depression, was the main cause of Lin's pain and nightmares.<br /><br />&quot;She wrote the book because she hoped there will never be another Fang Ssu-chi in society,&quot; the statement said.<br /><br />Born into a famous dermatologist's family in the southern city of Tainan in 1991, Lin was diagnosed with depression when she was a teenager. She scored the full 75 grade points in the college entrance examination in 2009 and was admitted to a medical university.<br /><br />However, she dropped out after just two weeks and retook the college entrance examination, switching her major to Chinese literature. But due to her depression, she was unable to finish university and again dropped out of school in her junior year.<br /><br />&quot;I often suffer from mental illness episodes that prevent me from attending school. For a long time I felt inferior,&quot; the writer once said in an interview.<br /><br />In the author's biography section of the novel, Lin introduced herself as someone with not much professional or academic experience.<br /><br />&quot;Out of all my identities, I am most accustomed to my role as a mental illness patient. My dream is to write novels, and like what Kenzaburō Ōe said, advance myself from a mere reader of books, to a person of culture, to an intellectual,&quot; Lin wrote.<br /><br />The Taipei District Prosecutors' Office said that if her family wishes to press rape charges, prosecutors will handle the matter according to the law.<br /><br />A senior prosecutor said in this case, prosecutors can investigate the matter if Lin's family presses charges and provides evidence, such as the suspect's name, time and location of the alleged crime. <br /><br />(By Christie Chen, Liu Shih-yi and Sabine Cheng)ENDITEM/J<br /><br />Discussion : <br />Q1.What do you think about Lin Yi-han's death?<br />Q2.Why are rape victims prone to suicide?<br />Q3.Why do victims of rape and abuse stay silent?<br />Q4. How do rape victims recover from trauma? <br />Q5. What can we do to help a person who has been raped or sexually assaulted?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">dora</a> — Fri May 12, 2017 9:41 pm</p><hr />
