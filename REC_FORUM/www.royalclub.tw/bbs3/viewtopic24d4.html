I have a massive lack of motivation to do anything or really live my life. I look deep within myself for answers and see that I've always felt no matter what I attempt to do, my hard work NEVER (in all caps) pays off. School, volleyball, work, even friendships. It never seems to be enough. I now realize hard work isn't enough, so I want to know, what is? What can I do to re-motivate myself and make my hard work smart work? How can I make my efforts count so I can live a meaningful, fulfilling life? Thank you for everything that you do. The beauty in your soul transcends my small computer screen and no amount of words will ever be enough for me to express my appreciation to you. With love, Chris.” <br /><br />Aww! Chris, I adore you and not just for that really sweet and poetic thing you just shared with me. I've gotta tell you, it is beyond awesome that you are so self aware. Self aware enough to really ask these important questions at this point in your life. While there's so much we could talk about today, I want to focus on one important shift that you can make that if you really do it, Chris, and you make it a habit, it can change everything. First you will instantly start to experience more of that meaning and fulfillment that you've been craving. Second, that motivation and excitement for life, that's going to come flooding back to you. And third, this approach will give you the best possible chance of ensuring that your hard work will actually pay off. Now, while it can't guarantee results, because honestly nothing can, it does give you the best possible chance of creating them. Here's the habit. If you want lasting motivation, you've got to focus on the action itself, not the outcome. Now, it doesn't matter whether this is about school or work or sports or relationships. <br /><br />Moving forward, Chris, here's what you've got to do. You have to consciously shift your attention to the action you're taking instead of the outcome or the result that you're trying to achieve. In other words, start giving your full attention to the present moment, to the actual process itself, not the end goal. It's a practice that I call &quot;making isness your business,&quot; which we talk about in more detail in this video over here. This is both a spiritually satisfying way to approach your life and it will give you the best chance to get that payoff that you're looking for. <br /><br />In fact, there is some research to back this up. It shows that this one habit can help you stay genuinely motivated and experience that meaning and fulfillment that you're lacking right now. Here's a quick summary of the science. Two researchers, Fishbach and Choi, from the University of Chicago and Korea Business School conducted a study with over 100 students working out at the gym. They divided the students up and one group was told to describe and focus on their end goal, like losing weight. The other group was told to describe and focus on the process itself: warming up, stretching, running on the treadmill. Both groups were told to keep that same focus throughout their entire workout. Now, check out the result. The end goal focus group actually ran for less time than the process focus group, 34 minutes versus 43 minutes. And, this is what's relevant to you, Chris, the goal group reported that the workout felt like more of an effort compared to the process group, who found the experience itself more enjoyable. Then they repeated this process with things like doing origami and flossing your teeth and the results were consistent. Must have perfect mouth health! I'm really enjoying the feeling of flossing my teeth! Winner: Most likely to floss for life! The bottom line, if what you're looking for is lasting motivation, meaning, and fulfillment, you have got to focus your attention on the actions you're taking, not the end goal. <br /><br />You know, high performance athletes and sports psychologists, they have known about this and they've practiced it for eons. Right? Once you're clear on your goal, they all talk about the fact that if you really want to win you have to train yourself to engage fully in the present moment and really get into that state of flow. So this is your mission, Chris. If you choose to accept it, it will make a tremendous difference in both how you feel and what you achieve for the rest of your life. Now, two more quick notes before we wrap up. Number one, you've gotta commit to being a lifelong learner and ask for feedback from people that you trust and respect. Because who knows, Chris? I mean, maybe there is stuff that you're doing that you could actually improve. <br /><br />For example, you might want to ask your soccer coach if he or she has any feedback for you that can help your performance on the field. There is always another level of mastery to reach in any area of life. So be proactive and get the feedback that you need to keep on growing. Number two, whenever you feel down and demotivated I want you to do this. You've gotta help somebody else. Just take a look around and ask yourself who might need a little encouragement or some support or some appreciation? I mean, is it a family member or a friend or someone in your community? It doesn't have to be some huge, monumental act, just something simple from your heart, and you've got a big one. I mean, one of the best ways to stay rooted in your own happiness is to help someone else experience their own. So let's wrap this one up with a reminder of this week's key habit and, yes, it's also our tweetable. The secret to staying motivated: focus on what you're doing, not what you're trying to achieve. Now I would love to hear from you. So can you relate to what Chris has been feeling lately? Like you're working really hard and yet it never seems to pay off? Do you have any personal habits that help you stay in that state of present moment flow in your own life? I want to hear from you. Stay on your game and keep going for your dreams because the world needs that special gift that only you have. <br /><br />Question<br />1.	Have you had this kind of experiences? Tell us your stories.<br />2.	Did you do something to change it? How to do? Is it working? <br />3.	When you are in this situation, do you think to keep enduring is a good way? Why?<br />4.	In teamwork, some people get a spotlight more often, some are free-rider, and some are work hard with no attention. If you are a leader, do you have some tips to balance all of your team members feeling?<br /><br /><br />Grit: The power of passion and perseverance  (意志力:熱情+毅力)<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance">https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_du ... rseverance</a><!-- m --><br /><br />When I was 27 years old, I left a very demanding job in management consulting for a job that was even more demanding: teaching. I went to teach seventh graders math in the New York City public schools. And like any teacher, I made quizzes and tests. I gave out homework assignments. When the work came back, I calculated grades. <br />What struck me was that IQ was not the only difference between my best and my worst students. Some of my strongest performers did not have stratospheric IQ scores. Some of my smartest kids weren't doing so well. And that got me thinking. The kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math, sure, they're hard: ratios, decimals, the area of a parallelogram. But these concepts are not impossible, and I was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough. <br />After several more years of teaching, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective, from a psychological perspective. In education, the one thing we know how to measure best is IQ. But what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily? <br />So I left the classroom, and I went to graduate school to become a psychologist. I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings, and in every study my question was, who is successful here and why? My research team and I went to West Point Military Academy. We tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop out. We went to the National Spelling Bee and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition. We studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods, asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year, and of those, who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students? We partnered with private companies, asking, which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs? And who's going to earn the most money? In all those very different contexts, one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success. And it wasn't social intelligence. It wasn't good looks, physical health, and it wasn't IQ. It was grit. <br />Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals. Grit is having stamina. Grit is sticking with your future, day in, day out, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality. Grit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint. <br />A few years ago, I started studying grit in the Chicago public schools. I asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires, and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduate. Turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduate, even when I matched them on every characteristic I could measure, things like family income, standardized achievement test scores, even how safe kids felt when they were at school. So it's not just at West Point or the National Spelling Bee that grit matters. It's also in school, especially for kids at risk for dropping out. <br />To me, the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know, how little science knows, about building it. Every day, parents and teachers ask me, &quot;How do I build grit in kids? What do I do to teach kids a solid work ethic? How do I keep them motivated for the long run?&quot; The honest answer is, I don't know. <br />What I do know is that talent doesn't make you gritty. Our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments. In fact, in our data, grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent. <br />So far, the best idea I've heard about building grit in kids is something called &quot;growth mindset.&quot; This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck, and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with your effort. Dr. Dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge, they're much more likely to persevere when they fail, because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition. <br />So growth mindset is a great idea for building grit. But we need more. And that's where I'm going to end my remarks, because that's where we are. That's the work that stands before us. We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions, and we need to test them. We need to measure whether we've been successful, and we have to be willing to fail, to be wrong, to start over again with lessons learned. <br />In other words, we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier. <br />Thank you. <br />Question<br />1.	 Grit is a soft power, it cannot measure it. How can you built ‘’ grit’’ up? <br />2.	‘’Grit’’ is definitely one of important factors when we do something successful. Do you have stories to share us? <br />3.	‘’Win on the start line’’ or ‘’ win on grit’’ which one do you agree? Why?</div>
