Yes, I see you. <br />I totally get it. <br />there is always a million things going on at once; things, people, Netflix, and YouTube get in the way and shift our schedule sideways.<br /><br />We have good intentions but the tasks we plan are left untouched. <br />We have to re-focus, get back in the productive zone, and pick up where we left off.<br />It’s not easy when life gets in the way. <br />In this article, I’ll take you a little behind the scenes and show you how I plan my days, and give you the best tips for planning your day.<br />I’ll teach you how to plan your day and stick to it without the overwhelm – like a true #GIRLBOSS.<br />I love planning.<br />This is going to be so much fun. <br />Let’s dive in!<br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br />HOW TO PLAN YOUR DAY AND STICK TO IT:<br />how to plan your day and stick to it like a true girlboss<br /><br />1. IDENTIFY YOUR TO-DO’S<br />The very first step to planning your day is to identify the things you have to do.<br />Your to-do’s, tasks and activities for the day.<br /><br />I love to do something called a to-do download.<br />It’s much like a thought download but focuses on your to-do’s instead.<br /><br />Simply pour out all your to-do’s, things that are lingering in your mind, tasks that you are procrastinating over and so on. <br /><br />It does not have to be specific for the day you are planning for – but anything you have going on at the time.<br /><br />A good time to do your to-do download is on Sunday evening.<br /><br />2. IMPORTANT VS URGENT<br />After you’ve poured your heart out on a piece of paper and you’ve got all your to-do’s scribbled down, it’s time to prioritize. <br />Which tasks are important?<br />Which tasks are urgent?<br />It’s important to separate these two factors because all though it may seem like they’re the same – they are in fact not.<br />If we don’t differentiate between what is important and urgent, overwhelm and procrastination will for sure pop up more than we’d like. <br /><br />An important task is something that MATTERS to you, something you want that is aligned with your goals, dreams, and passion. <br /><br />These are the action steps that will get you the results you want. <br /><br />An urgent task will try to make you think it’s important when it’s really not. <br /><br />Urgent tasks steal our focus and attention in the present moment.<br /><br />For example:<br />A phone rings.<br />You get a text.<br />A notification on Facebook you feel you have to respond to.<br />Doorbell rings.<br />Of course, I am not talking about emergencies – that is different. <br />When you plan your day, focus on what is most important to you and do not react to urgency. <br />Prioritize your tasks in order of importance and ALWAYS start with the most important task first. <br /><br />3. CHOOSE YOUR PLANNER<br />Choose a favorite planning tool and stick to it. <br /><br />There is a quote that goes a little something like this:<br />“You don’t need another planner, you just need a plan.”<br /><br />Pick the planning tool that speaks the loudest to you and don’t think too much about this step.<br /><br />If you’re all about digital – go digital.<br />If you’re into pen and paper – go physical. <br />I’ve listed my favorite planning tools below if you need a little help and direction in this area. <br /><br />So, scroll down if you’re curious.<br /><br />4. FOCUS ON YOUR RESULTS<br />Bring back your to-do’s from your to-do download and schedule them on your calendar.<br />Always be focused on your goals and the results you want to produce, and not the task in itself. <br />Schedule these results on your calendar, ahead of time. <br /><br />Here’s what I mean: <br />Good example: Finish draft of new blog post<br />Bad example: Work on the blog<br />See the difference?<br /><br />Be very specific about the results you want to achieve during your day and get them done no matter what. <br /><br />It’s not about the time and effort you put in, it’s always about the results and value of what you produce. <br />There’s a difference.<br />You can spend HOURS on your blog and not get anything of value done.<br />Always focus on the results you want to achieve and you’ll feel and be much more productive. <br /><br />Jut a little life hack for you. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />5. SCHEDULE YOUR DOWNTIME<br />Planning your day can quickly become a little overwhelming and feel like your whole calendar is packed with to-do’s, tasks and no breathing room. <br />Hold that thought. <br /><br />Be sure to schedule the fun stuff too. <br /><br />Schedule your downtime, social activities, when you eat and sleep (yes even the time you plan on being asleep). <br /><br />If you do this, you will never feel bad about hanging out on your couch for an hour or two watching Netflix, and you won’t resent your plans or your calendar. <br /><br />If it’s on your calendar, it’s a go! <br /><br />Schedule a little buffer time between each task (30 minutes or so), so you have time to take breaks, re-focus and rejuvenate.<br /><br />tips for planning your day<br />Plan for your downtime, sleep, and self-care routine. Yes, even for Netflix-watching.<br /><br /> <br /><br /><br />6. GIVE YOURSELF LESS TIME <br />Give yourself less time to produce.<br />Don’t give yourself too much time to do something.<br /><br />If you give yourself 10 hours to write an article, it will take 10 hours.<br /><br />If you give yourself 1 hour, it will take you 1 hour. <br /><br />I know this may seem impossible but if you commit and stay uber focused, you’ll be mindblown when it comes to how much we are capable of producing in a short amount of time. <br /><br />We often overestimated how long something will take. <br /><br />This is how you manage your time better. <br /><br />It’s like Parkinson’s Law: “Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.”<br /><br />7. PLAN ACCORDING TO ENERGY LEVELS<br />Plan your day according to your energy levels. <br /><br />Do your most time-consuming tasks during your prime time. <br /><br />Personally, I am more creative and inspired in the mornings, so I devote my mornings for blog post writing, creating digital products and whatever else requires my undisturbed attention.<br /><br />Other tasks like creating images in Canva or replying to emails requires less of my energy, so I save these tasks for the afternoon. <br /><br />I try not to be on any social media or in my inbox before noon. <br /><br />Figure out when your prime time is and plan accordingly. <br /><br />8. COLOR CODE IN GOOGLE CALENDAR<br />I love me some color coding in Google Calendar. <br />This is how I plan and organize my days. <br />I have a different color assigned to different tasks and activities. <br /><br />Blue for my online business. <br />Yellow for downtime, sleep, and self-care.<br />Purple for my 9-5 job. <br />Pink for new blog post creation. <br />Here’s a sneak peek of how a day can look in my world.<br /><br />As you can see, I plan down to the dot and I am very specific about the results I want to produce in the given timeframe.<br /><br />I always honor these commitments. <br /><br />I’ve made a date with myself and I’m going to show up. <br /><br />The screenshot below shows what my day looks like when I have the day off to work solely on my business (I go ALL in as you can see) and on a weekday when I also have to be at my 9-5. <br /><br />See below: <br />how to plan your day using google calendar<br />A little tip is to fill the description box for each task with bullet points for quick ideas that will further explain what needs to get done.<br /><br />For example, under “finish first draft of the blog post” I could also write:<br /><br />9. PLAN IN ADVANCE<br />Plan your days in advance. <br /><br />If you plan in the moment, your brain won’t feel like doing whatever it is that you plan. <br />It simply will not feel like it – that’s just the way your primitive brain works. <br />Grab a cup of tea and take the time to plan your day the night before. <br />I usually plan out my days on a weekly basis on Sundays. <br />Now of course – things don’t always go according to plan because life happens, but I find it so much easier to produce the results I want if I schedule WAY ahead of time.<br /><br />If you plan ahead you will always know where your focus should be at any given moment. <br /><br /><br />10. IDENTIFY YOUR TOP 3<br />When planning your day the night before, identify your top 3 to-do’s.<br />These are the tasks that if you complete, you will feel satisfied with your day – no matter what. <br />It’s a great way to avoid the overwhelm of overscheduling (because, let’s face it, planning your days and color-coding in Google Calendar can get really addictive and it’s easy to go overboard).<br /><br />The rest of your to-dos will be AMAZING if you achieve, however you shouldn’t schedule more than 3 important tasks for every day. <br /><br />11. KEEP YOUR CALENDAR OPEN ALL DAY, EVERY DAY<br />If you’re a digital gal, it’s easy to neglect your calendar and simply close down the tab.<br />Keep your calendar open all day and set reminders for each task.<br />Google will notify you when it’s time to jump onto your next task.<br />Also, add a shortcut to your browser so you can easily find your calendar if you close it by mistake. <br /><br /> <br />THE BEST PLANNING APPS &amp; TOOLS OUT THERE<br />Google Calendar – Obviously my go-to digital planner <br />The Productivity Planner – If you are into physical planners, this is THE best planner for daily and weekly planning.<br />Trello – A project managing tool, amazing for organizing to-dos.<br />Asana – A more advanced project managing tool. However, when you get the hang of it and all its features, it’s truly amazing.  <br />Todoist – A to-do list and task manager app. <br /><br /><br />Discussion:<br />1. Planning is the key to have a fulfilled and successful life. Do you agree of it?<br />2. Do you always feel busy every day?<br />3. Does it really help  to keep a to do list with yourself <br />4. Do you like to keep note takeing everyday? <br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Session 2: 10 Meaningful Ways to Celebrate Christmas This Year<br /><br /><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/10-meaningful-ways-celebrate-christmas-212004011.html" class="postlink">https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/10-meaningful-ways-celebrate-christmas-212004011.html</a><br /><br />After a long, difficult year, these are our favorite budget-friendly ways to make this holiday season extra special.<br />After a year full of changes and uncertainty, I am more excited about the upcoming holiday season than ever before. Of course, the pandemic is far from over—and it’s been a trying year for many—so our classic holiday celebrations might look a little different this year, and that’s OK. Rather than carrying on as normal, this Christmas is a great time to mix things up and try new holiday traditions. <br /><br />If your Christmas dinner has fewer guests this year, skip the whole ham and try a delicious new menu. And if your holiday budget is tight, don’t stress the gifts! Turn gifts and stockings into a fun game by drawing names so that each person only has to buy one gift. This year, try to focus less on buying the latest and greatest decor and gifts, and turn your focus to spending more quality time with your family. You might just find that these new celebrations become yearly traditions you can’t live without!<br /><br />christmas tree in basket<br /><br />CREDIT: ANIKO LEVAI<br />Related Items<br />Start a New Family Tradition<br />After a crazy and unexpected year, we could all use some extra quality time with the family. This season, start a new Christmas tradition and get the whole family involved. Order matching pajamas, start an Advent calendar, or fill a gratitude jar. The traditions don’t have to be expensive or elaborate; all you have to do is carve out a few hours and spend the time doing something fun together.<br /><br />Serve a Non-Traditional Dinner<br />It’s OK to skip the traditional Christmas ham this year, especially if you’re expecting fewer guests than normal. Instead, opt for something totally different, like a fancy dinner from a local restaurant. No matter what you serve at Christmas dinner, what matters most is who is around the table.<br /><br />Wrap Gifts in Fabric<br />Wrapping gifts is one of my favorite pre-Christmas traditions, but wrapping paper is horrible for the environment because we use so much of it, and it can’t be recycled. A few years ago, my family started wrapping our gifts in fabric instead of paper and we’ve never looked back. Invest in a few fabric bags or patterned furoshiki wraps that can be used year after year. Plus, you’ll save a fortune not buying new rolls of gift wrap each season!<br /><br />Host a Virtual Gathering<br />The best part of the holidays is being with family, but as the pandemic continues on, it’s likely that not all of your family members will be able to meet up in one place. If you’re missing the hustle and bustle of a houseful of guests, consider planning a virtual celebration this season. Gather the family on Zoom and have everyone decorate cookies “together” in their own homes, or use the Netflix Party app to watch a classic holiday movie together. <br /><br />Decorate like Grandma<br />Your grandma’s favorite vintage decor trends are back in style—and you should totally be decorating with them this year. Ceramic Christmas trees have made a huge comeback, and there are some affordable options you can order online. And if your grandma displays an elaborate Christmas village every year (mine does!), you’ll love the sentimental aspect of these trees decorated with Christmas village pieces.<br /><br />Give Back<br />Giving back to the community is one of my favorite ways to celebrate the season. There are so many ways to help out around the holidays, whether it’s volunteering at a food bank or participating in an adopt-a-family program and helping to buy or wrap gifts for others. If your family already does one of these traditions, consider adding a second or third! You’ll never regret helping more people. If you’re not comfortable going out and serving in person, there are also 7 easy ways to volunteer from home! <br /><br />Adopt a New Cultural Celebration<br />Everyone celebrates the holiday season differently, and there are so many meaningful traditions celebrated by different cultures and in different parts of the world. This season, learn about your family’s heritage and adopt a few of their traditions into your own celebration. Of course, you never want to appropriate another culture, but adding a respectful celebration to your holiday plans can be both fun and meaningful. Perhaps take the time to learn the story of Hanukkah and make latkes together as a family, or celebrate your Italian heritage by hosting your first-ever Feast of the Seven Fishes on Christmas Eve. <br /><br />Play a New Christmas Game<br />When the weather outside is frightful and we’re still practicing social distancing, it can be difficult to find enough indoor activities to keep the family entertained. You’ve heard of White Elephant gift exchanges (also known as Yankee Swap), but there are other fun holiday-themed games you can introduce to the fam this year. One of my favorites is Pass the Present, or the Left-Right game. Here’s how it works: Everyone brings a small, funny gift (we typically set a $5 limit) and wraps it however they like. Everyone sits around a table with their own gift in front of them as a poem is read out loud (here’s the one we use). Every time the word ‘right’ is read, you pass the gift in front of you to the right. When the word ‘left’ is said, you pass to the left. At the end of the game, you unwrap the gift in front of you and guess who brought the gift.<br /><br />Draw Names for Gifts<br />This year has been hard for many, and the added financial stress of the holidays is something you can totally skip this year. To cut down on costs while keeping things fun, draw names for stockings and gifts, and set a price limit for each person. If you want, you can keep the names a secret until the gifts are opened and have each person guess who their gift-giver was in a secret Santa style.<br /><br />Give Practical Gifts<br />It’s never fun to open a gift you know you won’t use, especially when you can’t or don’t want to return it. In past years, I’ve tried to buy people fun or “splurge” gifts that I know they won’t buy for themselves. And while it’s fun to pick these out, after a financially stressful year, you don’t want to spend money on something you know won’t be used—and your recipient would much rather receive a gift that’s helpful to them. <br /><br />So this year, consider switching things up. Rather than guess what people want or will use, ask your family members to make a Christms list of practical gifts instead—think a meal kit subscription service to cut down on grocery bills, household tools or kitchen appliances that need to be replaced, or gift cards to save money at most-frequented stores.<br /><br /><br /><br />Discussion:<br />1. Chrismas Season is coming in this month, how do you like  it? <br />2. What is the feeling  on  X’mas  season? do u have any plan?<br />3. Do you ever receive gift ? What was the gift you had received this year?<br /><br /> <br />P.S.<br />1.參加三次後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />2.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~</div>
