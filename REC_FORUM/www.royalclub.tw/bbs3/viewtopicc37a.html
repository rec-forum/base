According to analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data by the Pew Research Center, 17 percent of U.S. newlyweds in 2015 were married to someone of a different race or ethnicity from their own, up from 3 percent in 1967.<br />In some metropolitan areas, of course, the numbers are significantly higher due to more diverse populations. That certainly seems to be the case in Morocco, where I’m frequently meeting other foreigners like myself who have married into the culture, or learning of yet another Moroccan who has married someone from another land.<br /><br />The same is happening elsewhere. A 2014 article in The Telegraph reported analysis that showed nearly 1 in 10 people living in Britain are married to or living with someone from outside their own ethnic group, while a 2009 study in Germany revealed that intermarriages made up 12.9 of all marriages in 2006. Such statistics shouldn’t be surprising. Today’s technology makes global communication both instantaneous and an important part of everyday life. Throw in social media, ease of travel, immigration, and work or study abroad experiences, and it’s only natural that more people than ever before are meeting and finding common ground with someone from another culture.<br />While the prospect of cross-cultural marriage may seem exciting, couples from very different backgrounds tend to face extra challenges. Issues that might barely surface between same-race or same-culture spouses have the potential to become messy conflicts for intercultural couples. It makes sense then to give extra careful consideration to whether your own possible union is as promising as you’d like to think.<br />Here are eight issues to think about before you say “I do” in an intercultural marriage, particularly those with a foreign-born spouse.<br />1. Gender Roles<br />Don’t assume the balance you currently have will exist two years down the road. While gender roles in Western society have blurred tremendously in recent decades, many cultures follow a more-clearly defined family and social structure. So while your foreign-born fiancé seems to admire your diploma and career goals – and may even brag about them to his family – he might eventually expect you to be more of a homemaker than a bread-winner.<br />2. Extended Family<br />You may have grown up visiting your grandparents only twice a year, but a foreign-born spouse might come from a large extended family where everyone is hands-on with the baby, women defer to a family matriarch, and grown sons are expected to financially support elderly parents. Know the family structure and etiquette of your own spouse’s culture and upbringing, and prepare to be more yielding than you might be in a same-culture marriage.<br />3. Visits from In-Laws<br />If you do enter into a cross-cultural marriage, be prepared for the possibility of lengthy visits from family. In-laws traveling from overseas or out of town might expect to stay for months.  And, if you end up living in your foreign spouse’s home country, you may find that local family will not only drop in for unexpected visits, but also might surprise you by staying for days on end. Depending on the hospitality norms of your spouse’s culture, this can become both taxing and vexing, particularly if communication is difficult. While setting clear boundaries for such visits may seem logical to someone from the US, doing so can backfire if your in-laws perceive that as inhospitable and offensive.<br />4. Prejudices and Social Attitudes<br />No matter how liberal and open-minded your spouse appears to be, she might harbor subtle prejudices or occasionally display a bigoted opinion. Culture often plays a role in such attitudes. Take time to become aware of common prejudices and prevalent social attitudes of your spouse’s culture – before you find yourself disliking the person you married or the country you moved to.<br />5. Religion<br />According to the U.S. Religious Landscape Survey, one-third of married Americans have a spouse with a different religious affiliation. While you may feel supportive of each other’s faiths, spirituality grows and wanes – and this has the potential to displace previous expectations. Issues such as modesty, socializing, religious observances, holiday celebrations, dietary restrictions, and in what religion to raise the children need to be looked at from both conservative and liberal points of view.<br />6. Parenting<br />Even couples from the same culture find themselves clashing on everything from snack foods and toilet training to bedtime routines and discipline techniques. But there are extra dilemmas with regard to child-rearing in cross-cultural marriages – and debating whether or not to raise bilingual children is only one concern. Social norms around the world vary greatly with regard to showing affection, catering to children’s whims, involvement of family, appropriate gender play and roles, behavioral and scholastic expectations, and more. Be in agreement not to undermine each other’s unique parenting styles.<br />7. Where to Live<br />Living abroad may sound exotic and alluring, but the reality might not be so peachy, especially if your destination is a less-developed part of the world. A foreign language, separation from your own family, and frequent misunderstandings with in-laws and new acquaintances can overwhelm an expatriate. Moving to a new country may also involve a loss of independence due to lack of language, lack of cultural fluency, or even an overprotective spouse. This can prove particularly challenging to someone who’s used to moving about freely and decisively. While such issues may seem irrelevant or distant during the newlywed period, the likelihood of a move abroad could increase over time. If you have children, for example, your foreign-born spouse might believe that “home” is a better environment. Or, you both may decide to immerse the children in their other culture.<br />8. Personality<br />As in any marriage, your partner’s personality is one of the most important aspects to consider – and remember to be honest in evaluating your own personality as well. Some people are easy-going and adapt readily to new ideas and attitudes, while others may be prone to self-righteousness or taking an unyielding stance. A cross-cultural marriage has less chance of succeeding if both partners can’t be open, flexible and good-natured about the unexpected curve balls that come their way.<br /><br />Discussion questionnaire:<br />1.

Here are seven challenges the bloc faces in promoting sustainable economic growth, and suggested steps to solve them.<br /><br />1. Geopolitical stability and regional relationships<br />ASEAN was formed in 1967, with an agreement by the five original founding nations – Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand – to organize for the sake of peace, stability and cooperation. ASEAN states are located at a strategically important junction, bordering two of the world’s most populous economic powers, China and India, which makes ASEAN a focal point for both regional and global powers. ASEAN member states are also enmeshed in territorial disputes with interested powers. China’s claim to territories in the South China Sea, for example, overlaps with competing claims by Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, the Philippines and Viet Nam. While there are challenges, closer coordination and common goals among ASEAN governments can help promote stability and lessen the prospect of conflicts.<br /><br />2. Governance challenges for businesses<br />ASEAN is home to a wide variety of businesses, including a number of huge family-owned conglomerates and state-linked enterprises, like the Central Groupin Thailand, Salim Group in Indonesia, state-linked Singtel in Singapore, and Vinamilk in Viet Nam. Yet small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) together with micro-entrepreneurs make up at least 89% of business activity in the region.<br />Entrenched interests with the large conglomerates, paired with widespread corruption, is undermining the region’s business environment and is particularly hurtful for small enterprises. The ASEAN region needs strong independent civic institutions to prevent corruption and to help the region compete globally. One hope is that digital innovations will enable greater transparency and promote economic growth.<br /><br />3. New business models<br />The ASEAN region offers a growing market of more than 600 million consumers. The region’s GDP per capita measures about $6,500 (excluding Singapore, the region’s most advanced economy), which is less than China but more than India. Consumers in the region are price-sensitive and demanding, resulting in local businesses with low margins and low labour costs – formidable competitors to foreign rivals.<br />One way for new entrants to adapt and increase profits is to focus on specific consumer needs and conditions in the region and work backward to develop solutions. Mobile technologies can be particular useful, especially given the high mobile adoption rates in the region. Government support can also ensure companies are encouraged to innovate by reducing the cost burden of potential failure. This can be done with a so-called “light touch” regulatory approach, which fosters creativity and entrepreneurship.<br /><br />4. Changing demographics<br />ASEAN is home to young, literate and increasingly urbanized and aspirational populations. Consumers in the region are demanding higher-quality products and services and presents an opportunity for businesses hoping to tap growing consumer markets.<br /><br />Governments must help prepare young people to face the demands of an increasingly integrated economic region, through education and training. Current efforts by ASEAN countries may not be adequate. And as more people migrate to cities such as Manila or Jakarta in search of better opportunities, they create a pressure on existing infrastructure and job markets. Sustainable solutions will require innovative approaches. Issues ranging from affordable housing, to low-cost, quality healthcare and education call for ASEAN governments to work closely with private sector and non-government organizations.<br /><br />5. Inclusive growth and sustainable development<br />ASEAN member states span a wide spectrum of income levels, ranging from Singapore’s GDP per capita of $57,714 to Cambodia’s $1,384 and Myanmar’s $1,298 in 2017. In recent years, lower-income states have made important gains. However, regional economic gains have fallen short of erasing significant differences among ASEAN member states. The World Bank’s most recent 2017 edition of the Global Findex showed that while 98% of adults in Singapore and 85% in Malaysia had a bank account, just 22% of Cambodian adults and 26% Burmese adults did. These disparities illustrate the need for broad, robust investment in infrastructure, financial institutions and strategic planning.<br /><br />6. Regional digital economy<br />South-East Asia is home to the world’s fastest growing population of internet users, with more than 125,000 new users forecast to come online every day through the year 2020. Most of that growth will come via mobile use, and it has the potential to stimulate new industries, leapfrog legacy business models and fundamentally change the lives of millions of people. However, technology adoption differs greatly among ASEAN countries, and there is a need to build regional internet infrastructure.<br /><br />7. Economic integration<br />With the launch of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) in 2015, ASEAN member states have formed a tighter, more integrated group. The AEC aims to foster a single market and industrial production capacity, increase competitiveness, support inclusive growth and further integrate the region into the global economy. In addition, a revised Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) was signed by ASEAN countries, Australia, Canada and others in 2018, following the US’s withdrawal from the agreement.<br /><br />[Ishtiaq Pasha Mahmood is a Professor at the National University of Singapore Business School and Co-curator of the Transformation Map on ASEAN.]<br /><br />Discussion Questionnaire<br />1.
