Here are some tips for resolving conflict in your workplace and professional life.<br />1. Don’t be afraid of conflict.<br />Too many of us become agitated when we encounter conflict or disagreement out of concern and fear. It’s odd when you think about it because conflict is a part of nature, a part of life, and unless you are a hermit, odds are that it’s inescapable.<br />You need to approach conflict calmly, as an expected part of dealing with others. Consider conflict as a way of learning to see things in a more clear way.<br />2. Abandon the concept of winning and losing when faced with conflict.<br />Instead, adopt a strategy of resolution. Unless you are on a battlefield, chances are the person you come into conflict with is not the enemy, but instead someone whose goals are generally the same as—or at least interrelated with—yours.<br />So instead of approaching the conflict with the attitude of stopping it, think of redirecting the energy toward a common target. War is part of our nature, but the most successful societies have been built on cooperation. And common goals are great unifiers.<br />When the other side senses that you are interested in finding a solution—common or not, yet—you likely will have created an ally where a potential adversary once stood. Rather than confrontation, you can work together in collaboration to find a solution that suits both sides.<br />Related: The Secret to Smart Negotiations Is Simply Empathy<br />3. Avoid negative or confrontational language.<br />Stop using “buts” and “you’re wrongs.”<br />Try using positive language that disarms rather than confronts, like, “I can see your point, and here is where I’m coming from…” or “I understand your position, and…”<br />4. Talk through the situation with a neutral party to gain perspective and clarity from that person.<br />It is always helpful to get a problem out in the open.<br />People you trust and who understand your frame of reference can provide valuable input. They can help you better understand what you are going through and tell you, for better or worse, whether they think you have properly judged or handled the situation.<br />5. Find something to distract you from the conflict.<br />Distance yourself from the problem. Start a new project, plan a family outing or take off on a vacation or weekend getaway.<br />Sometimes you have to clear your mind. The time allows you to reevaluate your position and maybe even come back with a fresh perspective of how to resolve that nagging conflict.<br /><br />1 Have you experienced any conflict which troubled you a lot?<br />2 How did you deal with the conflicts?<br />3 Regarding the strategy of &quot;Find something to distract you from the conflict&quot;,do you think it is a good approach to the problem?<br />4 Is there any strategy also good for you to handle the conflict?<br /><br />Saturday's meeting place:<br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=872">Shuman</a> — Sun Jun 10, 2018 7:51 pm</p><hr />
