What’s Benefits of Working During Your Vacation<br /><br />Copy from the internet articles as below :<br /><br />Having the freedom to work online opens the doors to the world, and if you’ve just figured out how to work remotely, it’s time to explore options for a workation. <br /><br />What is a workation? The workation definition isexactly what the word sounds like: work + a vacation. While working on vacation used to be frowned upon, more and more employees are discovering the benefits of work and vacations being put together. They’ve found that a work vacation can increase productivity while helping you relax on an adventure in paradise. As the world continues to social distance, moving your home office to a sunnier, more exotic location seems like just the thing to do, and here are a few reasons why:<br /><br />Have Less on Your To-Do List<br />When you escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life to work remotely, the other chores on your to-do list are often taken care of. When you’re staying at a hotel, you won’t have to worry about grocery shopping or cleaning the house. With all of that taken care of on your work vacation, you’ll be able to focus better on getting work done so that you can enjoy all the adventures and activities in your destination.<br /><br />Vacation Without Time Off<br />One of the best reasons to work remotely on vacation is that you won’t have to take time off. While you should run it by your boss, most jobs are flexible, and as long as you continue to work responsibly, you’ll be able to enjoy the relaxation and fun of traveling without having to use up vacation days.<br /><br />Work in Style<br />You may be wondering “What is a workation?” because you’ve been envious of the incredible remote work pictures you’ve seen online. When you combine work and vacation, you can trade the cubicle for a hammock on the beach or a balcony overlooking the sea. When you’re working on vacation instead of in the office, you’ll be able to get comfortable and soak up the view. With the sound of the waves crashing on the shore, spending the day working on vacation won’t seem that bad. Plus, when it’s time for a coffee break, you can head to the hotel’s restaurant for a relaxing break.<br /><br />Work Hard, Play Hard<br />The workation definition is both work and vacation, so it’s important to make plenty of time for both. While you may want to head out right away and spend the day burying your toes in the sand and sipping on icy margaritas, make sure to set a designated time to get work done. This will help you to stay in contact with your coworkers and avoid having a pile of emails to answer when you get back. One of the benefits of work and vacations going together is that you can head out to play when the day is done. Instead of clocking out and running errands, take a stroll on the beach, or book a luxury sailing cruise. By figuring out how to work remotely and still be productive, you’ll still have plenty of time to vacation each day. <br /><br />See Increased Creativity and Productivity<br />The benefits of work and vacations being combined include increased productivity and creativity. Without the distractions of coworkers, other to-do lists, or office noises, you’ll be able to focus better during your work hours, and the surrounding beauty of nature may just help spark a few new ideas. By getting out of your comfort zone and exploring the world, you’ll discover inspiration all around you on a work vacation. <br /><br />Take Advantage of Destinations with Low Levels of Covid Cases<br />At the current moment, it is more important than ever to take care of both your physical and mental health. While taking a workation can do wonders for your psyche, especially after months of social distancing and isolation, you may be wondering if it is safe to take a work vacation right now. When choosing your workation destination, look for places with a Safe Travels Stamp from the World Travel &amp; Tourism Council, which indicates its a safe zone from the Coronavirus. A number of beach destinations on Mexico’s coast have received this stamp, and with the new Travel Advisory, which downgraded risk in the country from a level four to a level three, you should find the confidence you need to schedule your next trip. You can be enjoying the benefits of work and vacation in no time.<br /><br />While people used to think that only workaholics put work and vacation together, more people are discovering the workation definition and seeing how it boosts their performance and wellbeing. After you’ve discovered how to work remotely, it’s time to get off your couch and explore the world.<br /><br />Questions: <br />1.Do you think is a good system having a workcation?<br />2.Do you prepare for a second life skill?<br />3.or Are you ready for a second career?<br />4.Do you content with your current job?<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Session 2: Trans-Siberian Railway Part 1 (Beijing To Mongolia)<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://youtu.be/knrepsKa0k4">https://youtu.be/knrepsKa0k4</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I want to travel to Xinjiang, China, and to take the train from Beijing to Siberia.<br />Would like to talk about your plan?<br /><br />Questions: <br />1.Do you like train traveling?<br />2.Is there any travel plans in your mind?<br />3.Do you have an unforgettable travel itinerary before? or what was your most memorable trip?<br />4.Do you feel fun when you are traveling on the train?</div>
