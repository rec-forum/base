			<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="color: #FF0040">(Note: Please refer to the new meeting place at the end of this post)<br /></span></span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Session I</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Travel Frog: The cute Japanese game that has China hooked<br /></span><br /><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-42871181" class="postlink">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-42871181</a><br /><br />Over the past few weeks, gamers in China have become obsessed with a free-roaming Japanese frog.<br /><br />Travel Frog has topped the charts in the free game category in Apple's App Store in China for more than a fortnight.<br /><br />The game, developed by Japanese company Hit-Point and originally called Tabikaeru, is only in Japanese, but is easy to play despite the language barrier.<br /><br />It lets players own a cute little green frog which lives in a hut, where it eats, writes, reads and sharpens his pencil - sometimes it dozes over books.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The frog sometimes dozes over books.</span><br /><br />Out in its garden, player can collect clover, the primary currency in the game. You collect 20 clovers once every three hours simply by swiping across the garden, or you buy them with real money if you are too impatient to wait for them to grow.<br /><br />But the most curious feature of the app is that beyond that, players have very little control of the frog. It will frequently leave its home and travel around Japan on a whim.<br /><br />Players never know when the frog sets off, when it will get back nor what it will bring on its return. Sometimes the frog goes home within a few hours; sometimes it could be gone for as long as four days.<br /><br />It might send postcards, clovers, souvenirs - or might do absolutely nothing for its owner.<br /><br />There is no way for the owner to control or interact with the frog.<br /><br />Players never know when the frog sets off, gets back or what it brings back upon its return.<br /><br />The only thing that players can do is to prepare food, tools and amulets for the wandering frog.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Taste of parenthood</span><br /><br />&quot;I like the game because the frog does whatever it likes and I don't have to spend a lot of energy on it,&quot; 27-year-old Shen told the BBC.<br /><br />Xian told the BBC she became a frog keeper a week ago, when she saw her friends share photos on WeChat, the Chinese equivalent of Facebook.<br /><br />&quot;I check my frog almost every 10 minutes at work, because my job is boring. I marvel at the photos that it sends to me from its adventures,&quot; said the 25-year-old.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The frog travels and sends photos to the owner</span><br /><br />&quot;My mother longs for my return home when I am away, but she wants me to go out when I am home. That's my exact feeling towards my frog,&quot; Xian said.<br /><br />&quot;But I feel desperate when I keep receiving photos of itself: it is so antisocial and doesn't make friends!<br /><br />&quot;Today, it posed together with a rat, I almost cried with joy, it finally has friends!&quot; Xian said.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The frog could be gone for as long as four days</span><br /><br />According to the latest data obtained by the BBC, via US-based App Annie, Travel Frog has been downloaded more than 3.9 million times in Apple's App Store in China since its launch in December.<br /><br />Chinese players have spent more than $2m (£1.4m) on in-app purchases for their frog babies.<br /><br />In Japan, however, it's been downloaded a mere 400,000 times on the App Store and Google Play combined, with users spending only $100,000.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">So what's the appeal?</span><br /><br />&quot;It really suits the post-90s generation, because we are overwhelmed with work,&quot; said Shen.<br /><br />When he saw the game going viral on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, he downloaded it instantly and now checks his phone frequently for frog updates.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">It is very rare for owners to receive photos of the frog with a bunch of friends</span><br /><br />&quot;Every time I open it, I am full of expectations. I want to know whether my frog is travelling, and what photos it has sent to me. I feel it is my son.&quot;<br /><br />When the frog is travelling, Shen finds another way to kill time.<br /><br />He has created a WeChat group called &quot;Post-90s Empty Nester Huddle Together for Warmth&quot;. Young people share feelings of parenthood in the group, to while away their frogless hours.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Many players have received photos of the frog camping with a butterfly</span><br /><br />&quot;The travelling frog is like everyone away from home,&quot; it posted on Weibo.<br /><br />&quot;What's the feeling of waiting for your kid? Please remember to visit your parents, all wandering frogs.&quot;<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />Q1: Do you want to play the game, Travel Frog, or not? Do you think that the game, the frog, which you can't control but just waiting it comes home, is fun/boring?<br />Q2: Why Travel Frog can become very popular in China and Taiwan, even with language barriers. <br />Q3: Is this game similar with parenthood? <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Session II</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">How IKEA has changed the way we shop </span><br /><br /><a href="http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20180201-how-ikea-has-changed-the-way-weshop" class="postlink">http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20180201-how-ikea-has-changed-the-way-weshop</a><br /><br />Ingvar Kamprad, who started Ikea as a teenager, died last week at the age of 91. He started with stationery and stockings, but went on to build one of the world’s biggest furniture companies. And the way he did it has revolutionised how retailers operate.<br /><br />There are two facets of modern life that we have Ikea to thank for: flat-pack furniture and a shop layout that gets you buying more of its products than you initially intended to. Both are principles that a number of other companies have put to good use.<br /><br />Ikea first brought out its now signature style of flat-pack furniture in the 1950s. Whether you love or loathe this concept, it was a stroke of genius and a effective way of making the masses value the brand. There are the obvious aspects of cost efficiency and the practicality of shipping. But flat-pack furniture also has an important subconscious influence on consumers.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The simple act of touching products can increase your overall perceived value of the product</span><br /><br />When Ikea made the switch away from selling furniture that was already assembled, it was most likely unaware of how it would influence its consumers. Yet scientists have since managed to pinpoint why consumers simply can’t get enough of building their own furniture. The simple act of touching products (and what better way to ensure touch based interaction than through assembling a piece of furniture) can increase your overall perceived value of the product. Couple this with the fact that the more effort a consumer has to put into building something the more they like it – you have an undoubtedly winning formula.<br /><br />Tests have shown that the actual act of putting something together (even though there may be sweat, swearing and tears involved) so that it becomes a complete object generates a much more favourable perception of that object than it would purchasing it in a completed form. The phenomenon is known as the Ikea effect.<br /><br />This effect is further enhanced by the fact that touch itself is neurologically coupled with emotion. This means that when we touch something the emotive part of our brain is activated so that we experience a close connection with the product. Touch creates feelings of ownership and increases the perceived value we have of items. Thus the happy assembler of the flat pack will, once finished, feel proud of their achievement and experiencing feelings of being closely connected to the item.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Round and round in circles</span><br /><br />The layout of the Ikea stores has also paved the way for a more creative way of thinking about how to guide shoppers. If you have ever visited one of its huge warehouse stores, you may have gone in thinking you were only buying a few items, to find yourself coming out of the store with a trolley full of things. This is because of its circular design and one-way system.<br /><br />This design means you often can’t see what is coming next and fear you’ll miss something you need if you don’t continue all the way along the path. There are potential escape points throughout the store, but that would mean that you will miss several of the sections and rarely consumers are prepared to take that risk.<br /><br />Because you know it may be tricky to revisit a particular item later on, you are inclined to pick it up when you see it and put it in your big trolley. This ensures that the customer touches the product, which in turn again generates a psychological sense of ownership over it and decreases the likelihood that it will be put down en route to the tills.<br /><br />The fact that you can’t see around the next corner also creates a subconscious sense of mystery, which draws the customer gradually further into the store<br /><br />The fact that you can’t see around the next corner also creates a subconscious sense of mystery, which draws the customer gradually further into the store. Environments perceived to be mysterious usually generate an overall stronger liking and so encourage shoppers to keep walking through the store. And the more you do this, the more likely you are to buy something – especially all the smaller items on display such as candles, napkins and picture frames as they seem cheap compared to the larger more expensive items.<br /><br />Ikea’s creative ability to tap into the unconsciousness of consumers is undoubtedly a big part of its success – and also why it’s been copied by many other companies. Even though Ingvar Kamprad is no longer with us, Ikea has inherited from him an ethos of thinking outside of the box to communicate with consumers. It will be interesting to see what follows next.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />Q1:Do you like to shop at IKEA, or not? What do you think about this world’s biggest furniture company? Cheap with quality?<br />Q2: Do you love or loathe the concept of “flat-pack” furniture? Have you competed any of that before? <br />Q3: What do you think about the a shop layout of IKEA? Do you find it really can make consumers buy more stuff than they intended to? <br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:05pm discussion session (35 mins)<br />8:05 ~ 8:20pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:20 ~ 8:25pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:25 ~ 8:35pm Taking a 10 minutes break (Intermission)<br />8:35 ~ 9:10pm discussion session (35 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~ 9:30pm Concluding remarks/feedback from newcomers<br />The meeting place of Thursday:<br /><span style="color: #FF0040">丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第一區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$90元<br /></span>最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
