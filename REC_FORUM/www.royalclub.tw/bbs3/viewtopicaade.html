			<div class="content">Mayday rocks Daan Forest Park, The China Post news staff  Thursday, March 30, 2017, 12:02 am TWN<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/arts-leisure/2017/03/30/494582/Mayday-rocks.htm">http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/arts ... -rocks.htm</a><!-- m --><br />TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Mayday (五月天), one of the most popular rock bands in the Chinese-speaking world, came back to the venue where they first started 20 years ago to put on a free concert for fans. Tens of thousands of people swamped the Daan Forest Park (大安森林公園) on Wednesday evening for the concert. According to figures provided by the Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation, the number of passengers exiting the Daan Forest Park Station as of 7 p.m. — the opening time of the concert — had surged from the weekday average of 8,000 to 38,000. Ashin (阿信), lead vocal of the band, thanked Mayday's fans for their over two-decades of support at the beginning of the concert. &quot;Thank you all, (it has been) 20 years, let's keep on singing,&quot; he said. &quot;No matter where tomorrow takes us, let's march towards the next 20 years together.&quot; Mayday performed 14 songs at the concert, which ended at around 9 p.m. They also invited indie pop star Cheer Chan (陳綺貞) and members from fellow rock bands Quarterback (四分衛) and TOLAKU (脫拉庫) to be special-guest performers at the concert. <br />The seating area in the park's performance area can accommodate no more than 800 people, in which 400 seats were reserved as priority seats, officials said. Those who could not enter the seating area watched the concert in other places in the park, where big LED screens had been set up. According to local media, many fans camped overnight in hopes of securing one of the 400-available seats. Among the campers were a couple in their seventies, who told reporters that they admired the sincerity of the band. B' In Music, Mayday's agency, opened the venue to fans at around 1 p.m. The crowd at the park were largely orderly on Wednesday afternoon. The company had earlier urged fans not to queue overnight, saying that the concert was meant to bring happiness for fans and not frustration. It was not only Mayday fans that were prepared for the concert, the Taipei City Government was fully prepared as well. The local government predicted as many as 20,000 had turned out for the gig. Five hundred staff and officers were deployed around the park in order to ensure public safety and smooth traffic. The Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation implemented an emergency adjustment to the train schedules. Previously these plans had only been applied on New Year's Eves. Trains on the red line, traveling from Tamsui to Xiangshan, and stopping at the Daan Park station departed every 3 minutes and 10 seconds after office hours. Taipei Metro claimed to have been able to commute as many as 3,000 passengers per hour. Some police officers suggested that that the concert was even harder to handle than demonstrations in terms of security. <br />Discussions :<br />a)	According to the report, tens of thousands of people swamped the Daan Forest Park on 3/29 evening for the concert of Mayday. Did you join this concert and how did you feel it ?<br />b)	&quot;No matter where tomorrow takes us, let's march towards the next 20 years together.&quot; 阿信said. For what reasons Mayday keeps so popular for the past 20 years? <br />c)	It may be the proud of Mayday’s fans because the crowd at the park was largely orderly at that night. Can we also keep orderly in other gatherings ? <br />d)	Some of you may be the loyal fans of Mayday. Can you sing their songs and which songs you like the best?  <br />Doing Small Things to Make Your Life Happier,   by Remez Sasson<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.successconsciousness.com/blog/tips-for-life/doing-small-things-to-make-your-life-happier/">http://www.successconsciousness.com/blo ... e-happier/</a><!-- m --><br />You can make your life happier and fill them with joy, by doing small, simple acts everyday. You don’t achieve great goals every day, nor do big things. Happiness is here and now, in the small things of life and you don’t need to seek it far. You can do small things that are within your reach to bring happiness into your life. Though small and simple, these acts will bring happiness into your life and make your day more enjoyable. Even if you are under pressure and strain, or if you have problems and difficulties, there are many little, simple actions that can make you feel happy. This happiness might not be strong and deep, and often is of short duration, but it certainly can improve the way you feel. Below, you will find a few suggestions for bringing small moments of happiness into your daily life. With some creative thinking you can find more ideas, which might be more suitable to your life and circumstances.<br />Small Things to Make Your Life Happier<br />1. Wake up 10 minutes earlier in the morning and go stand by the window. You may also go out to the yard or garden, if you have one. Look around you, and for a few moments enjoy the quietness and splendor of the morning. So may people overlook this splendor, when the world is awakening in the morning.<br />2. Arrange it so that you have a few spare minutes in the morning to make yourself a cup of coffee. Getting up a little earlier in the morning allows you to have enough time, before you go to work, to drink your coffee calmly and enjoy it.<br />3. Eat something you enjoy eating. It could be just a small piece of cake or a fruit.<br />4. Call up a friend you like, which you haven’t talked with for a long time and have a nice conversation.<br />5. Once in a while, buy yourself flowers.<br />6. Once in a while, buy yourself a book.<br />7. Once in a while, buy yourself a magazine about topics that you enjoy reading about.<br />8. Have a nap in the afternoon. This will relax you and renew your energies for the rest of the day.<br />9. Do something you like doing, but which you usually don’t have the time to do. This might need some arrangement beforehand.<br />10. Take some time out during the day and read a few pages of a book. You can do so before going to work, on the way to work, if you are traveling buy bus or train, at lunchtime, in the evening, or before going to sleep.<br />11. Close your eyes and rest your body and mind just for a few moments, even when you are very busy.<br />12. Take a break and go out to walk for a short walk, even if it is only for ten minutes.<br />I am sure there are other, small things that can make you happy, which relate specifically to your life. Add them to this list. This could be going to the movies, going to the theater, eating out, playing with your children, going to the swimming pool and many more. As you can see, happiness can be found in the small things of your everyday life.<br />Discussions :<br /><br />a.	Will you do some small things to make you happier ? Except the things mentioned as the above, what else can make you happier ? <br />b.	Do you think by doing a small thing to make you happier everyday is very important ?<br />e.  Do you agree or disagree for “ Money can buy the happiness? “<br />c.	Have you even felt unhappy because of 10 min late to wake up and missed the train or arrived the office late ? Show your experiences.<br /><br />Saturday's meeting place: <br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />tel: 2255-8132<br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
