Article I : Your letters：We need to learn ASEAN languages<br />The Jakarta Post<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/01/16/your-letters-we-need-learn-asean-languages.html">http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015 ... uages.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />NOTE：<br />The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, was established on 8 August 1967 in Bangkok, Thailand, with the signing of the ASEAN Declaration (Bangkok Declaration) by the Founding Fathers of ASEAN, namely Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Brunei Darussalam then joined on 7 January 1984, Viet Nam on 28 July 1995, Lao PDR and Myanmar on 23 July 1997, and Cambodia on 30 April 1999, making up what is today the ten Member States of ASEAN.<br /><br />Despite the discussion on the development of infrastructure and bureaucratic administration, understanding the language of ASEAN countries is another issue that plays an important role in promoting connectivity. Language, to some extent, has the power to unite people, which further triggers a sense of belonging to one community. <br /><br />The goal of the ASEAN Community 2015 is to create integration among 10 member states in Southeast Asia. The integration can be understood as an activity whereby people, goods and services can mobilize more freely; hence connectivity does matter in promoting the ASEAN community.<br /><br />Connectivity, in this case, is not merely about how people can move freely from one place to another. People are well-connected if they can engage with the locals and their culture. In doing so, understanding language could help people adapt to a new environment, and therefore, connecting people through language will be necessary.<br /><br />English is currently the official language in ASEAN. At the state level, English is commonly used by leaders as a working language in meetings and any decision-making process. <br /><br />English is also used in countries that recognize it as their official national language, such as Singapore, as well as Malaysia and the Philippines, which widely use English as their working language. <br /><br />The rest use their national language and rarely speak English on a daily basis, and some are even not very familiar with English.<br /><br />Recently, there has been a notion to propose Malay as the official language of ASEAN. The rationale lies on Indonesia' demographic power as the largest ASEAN population, in that Indonesia has a population of over 250 million that accounts for one third of the total ASEAN population. Moreover, Bahasa is known in several countries other than Indonesia, such as Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei Darussalam. <br /><br />Nevertheless, there is not much impact on promoting one of the ASEAN languages as the working language applicable to all ASEAN countries. <br /><br />Practically, this idea is similar to promoting English as the working language in ASEAN; English is taught in all the countries, but many are still unfamiliar with it.<br /><br />Although promoting English or one of the ASEAN languages is not yet having a significant effect, it does not necessarily mean that promoting such languages is not effective. <br /><br />It does not suggest people learn all the ASEAN languages, although it could be advantageous if they are able to do so. When choosing to learn a new language, people should understand the reason for choosing it. In other words, learning a new language is usually a motive-based activity.<br /><br />Communicating in the same language is necessary to bridge cultures and form one community. <br /><br />A framework under the ASEAN Economic Community, namely the Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA), morally requires expertise to master the language of a country where someone resides to ensure effective communication with local people at work.<br /><br /><br />DISCUSSION:<br />Q1 : Have you ever been to any country of ASEAN? Which country among them is your favorite one, and why?<br />Q2 : ASEAN among one another has very large differences in culture, foods, belief, the way of life and so on... What culture shock have you ever experienced? Which thing impresses you very much?<br />Q3 : English might be their common language for communication. But, except for English, have you learnt any of their language? What are the features of its language?<br />Q4 : Nowadays, ASEAN is growing up fast in economy, are you interested or willing to relocate there to develop your career if you get an opportunity (but, of course, with unpredictable challenge)? <br /><br />==========================================================================================================================<br />Article II : Kai-fu Lee：Find future opportunities from the weaknesses of the machine and let AI artificial intelligence be your「toolbox」<br />Author: Anqi Yang  April 21st, 2017<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://technews.tw/2017/04/21/ai-is-coming-by-kai-fu-lee/">https://technews.tw/2017/04/21/ai-is-co ... ai-fu-lee/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Since Google’s artificial intelligence (AI) system AlphaGo defeated South Korean Go players, the discussion about &quot;artificial intelligence is better than the human brain&quot; has once again reached a new peak. People can't help but worry that the science fiction movie plot will come true, and worry that AI will take a lot of work and even attack humans. But on the other hand, thinking about what we can do with AI and what opportunities we can find, maybe it is the focus that is more worthy of attention now.<br /><br />The AI era is a subversive one, with 50% of work facing transformation<br /> “Artificial intelligence is the tool which is extremely rational and grows up with data.” Kaifu Lee, Chairman and CEO of Innovation Works, mentioned many times during his interview : “By throwing in a single field and a large amount of objective data with clear annotations, artificial intelligence will learn quickly, and then predict, judge, classify, and make decisions.”<br /><br />Kai-Fu Lee believes that AI will replace 50% of work in the next decade, especially work with high repeatability, work quantifiable into numbers, and thinking time of no more than 30 seconds; In terms of industry, the financial industry with natural digital data will be the fastest welcoming field for AI transformation, followed by medical and education fields, and will also face AI impact.<br /><br />For Kai-Fu Lee, it is better to say that AI is to &quot;transform&quot; into a new form, rather than saying that AI will &quot;replace&quot; us and take away our work. He believes that all epoch-making technologies in history will inevitably lead to changes in people's lifestyles, accelerate the promotion of human development and improve people's quality of life. Although there will be a certain degree of pain, in the long run, social structure and economic order will be re-adjusted.<br /><br />The weakness of the machine is our opportunity<br />AI has powerful capabilities in most areas, but it doesn't mean that today's AI is omnipotent. Kai-fu Lee believes that AI has no empathy, no emotions, no understanding of beauty, no care for others, and no understanding of cross-disciplinary, common sense and abstract things. At this stage of AI development, it is still too early to think like people.<br /><br />People can find new opportunities or transform their work from areas that the machine can't. For example, Kai-Fu Lee, in the future, AI will be better at seeing a doctor than doctors, and it can diagnose diseases more objectively and accurately. The importance of doctors is to consider the mood of patients and their families, and to explain the condition in a more appropriate way. It is not as cold as a machine to Inform the situation to cause a blow.<br /><br />In the future, when all industries are moving towards human-machine integration, the liberal arts field is also a developmental path, such as art, philosophy, history, photography, painting, creation, etc., these abilities are not easily replaced by AI. In addition, jobs such as service industry and volunteers need to communicate with people and care type, are also opportunities in the AI era.<br /><br />Artificial intelligence like a toolbox, everything in it<br />Artificial intelligence is a convenient tool that can make a huge difference for human beings. &quot;AI should be a toolbox. There are a lot of tools out there to solve.&quot; In order to let more people come into contact with AI and promote the development of AI, Kai-fu Lee believes that technology alone is not enough. After all, AI is growing up with data, and must open the data. Therefore, the Innovation Workshop hopes to challenge the black hole enterprises in an open way, try to find some companies that are willing to share data, and work together to build an open database platform.<br /><br />With the help of AI technology, people can save time for unnecessary work, and then gain freedom and value, and get happiness from it. The AI era will come at a fairly fast pace. Instead of worrying about job being replaced and being unemployed, or speculating that AI is against humanity, ruling or even exterminating human beings, perhaps we should seize the opportunity to face challenges and actively seek new opportunities for self-realization.<br /><br />DISCUSSIONS : <br />Q1 : What do you think artificial intelligence technology? How is it influencing our life in the world? Do we need artificial intelligence?<br />Q2 : What are the typical jobs related to artificial intelligence? And which jobs will be easily and quickly replaced by it? And which jobs will not?<br />Q3 : Do you think that artificial intelligence will cause unemployment, the gap between rich and poor, and threaten human security?<br />Q4 : Do you like artificial intelligence? And how could you apply artificial intelligence to improve your life?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=48">dora</a> — Thu Nov 08, 2018 2:19 am</p><hr />
