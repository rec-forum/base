Please watch the film carefully before you think up questions to ask others and reply someone's question.<br />2. Your question can't be similar or the same as the others'. So, figuring out more questions is highly appreciated.<br />3. The host ( 1st person) will start by asking &quot;<br />one&quot; question that concerns the short film &quot;alternative math&quot;  and point at 2nd person at random to answer it. After answering it, the 2nd person can ask another question, and he has the right to point the 3rd person to answer his question. But the 3rd person has to ask the 3rd question  I offered to the 4th person. After the 4th person replies, he can ask the 5th person his own question about alternative math. And then continue. So, each participant is supposed to prepare some questions in his mind except he is 3rd, 6th, 9th,12th,15th person... <br />4. Speaking time will be strictly controlled. Each answer is for 2 minutes only.<br /><br />Questions for discussion:<br />Q1.<br />Q2.<br /> Q3. Education is a conscientious [͵kɑnʃɪˋɛnʃəs]career and tiring job but it's an honorable and sacred mission in Confucian society. Do you choose to survive or safeguard the truth if you are the math teacher in the US?<br />Q4.<br />Q5.<br />Q6. How to educate a free thinker?<br />Q7.<br />Q8.<br />Q9.  If you could teach math in the US, how to score your students? <br />Q10.<br />Q11.<br />Q12. We have watched some clouds inside the American education from the short film but every cloud has a silver lining. What silver lining do you find?<br />P.S.<br />1.因疫情關係，聚會方式改為線上遠距。<br />2.參加三次後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />3.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~</div>
