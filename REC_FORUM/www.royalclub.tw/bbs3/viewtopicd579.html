We're definitely being watched.”<br /><br />The family soon figured out that the camera was hidden on what they believe to be a smoke detector. The couple, who was traveling with their four children and niece, contacted Airbnb, which doesnʼt allow hidden cameras.<br /><br />&quot;Airbnb had no advice for us over the phone,&quot; Nealie Barker told NBC News, adding that the representative didnʼt seem to understand the severity of the situation.<br /><br />Feeling Airbnb was unhelpful, they called the host themselves. As he denied their questions about cameras on the property, she said, her husband asked, &quot;Well then why am I [looking] at a livestream of myself?&quot;<br /><br />The host hung up but called back later, saying there was only one hidden camera. <br />&quot;We totally lost his trust at this point,&quot; Nealie Barker said.<br /><br />The family soon found other accommodations. A few weeks later, they learned Airbnb exonerated the host, saying there was no proof of their claims. The result left the couple, who took photos of the hidden camera, infuriated.<br /><br />Then on April 5, Airbnb told them they re-investigated the claims and the host was removed from the platform. In a statement, Airbnb said its initial handling of the incident “did not meet the high standards we set for ourselves, and we have apologized to the family and fully refunded their stay.”<br /><br />The Barkers, who saved for 10 years to make the 14-month trek through Europe, said theyʼve relied on Airbnb throughout their trip, and are disappointed in how their complaint was handled.<br /><br />“We've had a lot of great experiences,” Nealie Barker said.&quot;We're going to take a different approach now.”<br /> Now, when her family stays in an Airbnb, they look for hidden cameras and scan the Wi-Fi network. They recommend others do the same.<br /><br />&quot;We won't be happy until there's some real policy change in how they deal with [situations like] this,” she said.<br /><br /><br />Discussion<br /><br />1.

The researchers say seniorsʼ increasingly active lifestyles may be the biggest factor, because dog ownership among older adults has remained stable over the past decade.<br /><br /><br />A LIVE DOG IS AMONG THE 50 STRANGEST THINGS LEFT IN UBERS<br /><br />Hip fractures are among the most common injuries, the study says, and nearly 80 percent of the patients have been women, whose generally lower bone density than that in men may be a factor.<br /><br />Susan Bush, 69, says she has been injured multiple times while walking her dogs – including suffering a broken leg while trying to prevent her dog from chasing a bear that came out of the woods near her Pennsylvania cottage.<br /><br />But despite surgery and rehab, she refuses to give up her pets.<br /><br />“Old people need our dogs,” she told the Associated Press. “We need our soulmates.”<br /><br />“Old people need our dogs. We need our soulmates.” — Susan Bush, 69, Pennsylvania dog owner<br /><br />Some seniors may be underestimating the physical risks involved in walking a dog every day, said Dr. Jaimo Ahn, an orthopedic surgeon and a lead author of the study.<br /><br />In most cases, Ahn blames what he called a “small person/big dog” scenario, in which a pet is simply mismatched with its ownerʼs ability to handle it, according to Philly.com.<br /><br />He also says that some seniors might not be as prepared to handle a pet as they should be.<br /><br />“Some of them are really well-trained, but others are really poorly trained,” he told the news outlet.<br /><br />The good news: Injuries resulting from dog-walking account for fewer than 1 percent of fractures among older adults, the research shows.<br /><br />The Associated Press contributed to this story.<br /><br /><br />Discussion<br /><br />1.Should seniors think carefully about taking a dog for a walk?<br />2.What other injuries can dogs cause?<br />3.How can seniors protect themselves while walking the dog?<br />4.What kind of exercise do you get?<br />5.Should old people be educated about walking the dog?<br />6.How beneficial is it to walk a dog?<br /><br /><br />//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////<br /><br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00 ~ 7:30 pm greetings &amp; free talk <br />7:30 ~ 8:15 pm guests introduced &amp; first session discussion <br />8:15 ~ 8:45 pm presentation, sharing the article &amp; other experiences <br />8:45 ~ 9:30 pm second session discussion<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />a minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文</div>
