Warning: More than half of all resolutions fail, but this year, they don’t have to be yours. Here’s how to identify the right resolution to improve your life, create a plan on how to reach it, and become part of the small group of people that successfully achieve their goal.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Pick the Right Resolution</span><br /><br />You’ll give yourself your best shot at success if you set a goal that’s doable — and meaningful too.<br /><br />According to the time management firm FranklinCovey, one a third of resolutioners don’t make it past the end of January.<br /><br />A lot of these resolutions fail because they’re not the right resolutions. And a resolution may be wrong for one of three main reasons:<br />•It’s a resolution created based on what someone else (or society) is telling you to change.<br />•It’s too vague.<br />•You don’t have a realistic plan for achieving your resolution.<br /><br />Your goals should be smart — and SMART. That’s an acronym coined in the journal Management Review in 1981 for specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound. It may work for management, but it can also work in setting your resolutions, too.<br /><br />•<span style="font-weight: bold">Specific.</span> Your resolution should be absolutely clear. “Making a concrete goal is really important rather than just vaguely saying ‘I want to lose weight.’ You want to have a goal: How much weight do you want to lose and at what time interval?” said Katherine L. Milkman, an associate professor of operations information and decisions at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. “Five pounds in the next two months — that’s going to be more effective.”<br /><br />•<span style="font-weight: bold">Measurable.</span> This may seem obvious if your goal is a fitness or weight loss related one, but it’s also important if you’re trying to cut back on something, too. If, for example, you want to stop biting your nails, take pictures of your nails over time so you can track your progress in how those nails grow back out, said Jeffrey Gardere, a psychologist and professor at Touro College of Osteopathic Medicine. Logging progress into a journal or making notes on your phone or in an app designed to help you track behaviors can reinforce the progress, no matter what your resolution may be.<br /><br />•<span style="font-weight: bold">Achievable</span>. This doesn’t mean that you can’t have big stretch goals. But trying to take too big a step too fast can leave you frustrated, or affect other areas of your life to the point that your resolution takes over your life — and both you and your friends and family flail. So, for example, resolving to save enough money to retire in five years when you’re 30 years old is probably not realistic, but saving an extra $100 a month may be. (And if that’s easy, you can slide that number up to an extra $200, $300 or $400 a month).<br /><br />•<span style="font-weight: bold">Relevant</span>. Is this a goal that really matters to you, and are you making it for the right reasons? “If you do it out of the sense of self-hate or remorse or a strong passion in that moment, it doesn’t usually last long,” said Dr. Michael Bennett, a psychiatrist and co-author of two self-help books. “But if you build up a process where you’re thinking harder about what’s good for you, you’re changing the structure of your life, you’re bringing people into your life who will reinforce that resolution, then I think you have a fighting chance.” <br /><br />•<span style="font-weight: bold">Time-boun</span>d. Like “achievable,” the timeline toward reaching your goal should be realistic, too. That m<br />eans giving yourself enough time to do it with lots of smaller intermediate goals set up along the way. “Focus on these small wins so you can make gradual progress,” Charles Duhigg, author of “The Power of Habit” and a former New York Times writer, said. “If you’re building a habit, you’re planning for the next decade, not the next couple of months.”<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />1.According to the article, a lot of resolutions fail because of one of the three main reasons: (1) it’s a resolution created based on what someone else (or society) is telling you to change; (2) it’s too vague; (3) You don’t have a realistic plan for achieving your resolution.<br />Do you agree with the author’s perspective when making resolutions for 2018?<br />2.According to the author your goals should be SMART-- Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound. Which one or ones do you think would be more important to make your goals doable and meaningful.<br />3.What are your resolutions for 2018? Compared with your former goals for past few years, are this year’s resolutions more special or meaningful to you? <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Section II</span><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">North Korea calls latest UN sanctions 'an act of war' </span><br /><a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2017/12/24/politics/north-korea-un-resolution-response/index.html" class="postlink">http://edition.cnn.com/2017/12/24/politics/north-korea-un-resolution-response/index.html</a><br /><br />(CNN) A new round of United Nations sanctions against North Korea are an &quot;act of war,&quot; Pyongyang said Sunday, adding that the US and other nations which supported the strict measures will pay a heavy price. <br /><br />The UN Security Council unanimously adopted US-drafted sanctions against North Korea last week, following a November intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test experts said was Pyongyang's most advanced yet. <br /><br />Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, said the new sanctions will strangle North Korea's energy supplies and tighten restrictions on smuggling.<br /><br />The resolution cuts exports of gasoline, diesel and other refined oil products by a total of 89%. It also bans the export of industrial equipment, machinery, transportation vehicles and industrial metals to North Korea, and requires countries currently hosting North Korean migrant workers to repatriate them within 24 months. <br /><br />Around 100,000 North Koreans work overseas, according to the UN, many of them in &quot;slave-like&quot; conditions. Most of their wages are sent back home, raking in an estimated $500 million each year for Kim Jong Un's regime. <br /><br />The new UN resolution also prohibits countries from smuggling North Korean coal and other prohibited commodities by sea and authorizes member states to inspect, seize and impound any vessels in their territorial waters found to be transporting prohibited items. <br /><br />Earlier this month Washington asked the UN to ban 10 ships from entering ports across the world over alleged dealings with North Korea. <br />The latest round of sanctions come just three months after the UN passed a US-drafted resolution described by Haley at the time as &quot;by far the strongest measures ever imposed on North Korea.&quot;<br /><br />The previous measures, unanimously adopted in September, had been designed to accomplish six major goals: cap North Korea's oil imports, ban textile exports, end additional overseas laborer contracts, suppress smuggling efforts, stop joint ventures with other nations and sanction designated North Korean government entities, according to a US official familiar with negotiations.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Complete economic blockade</span><br /><br />In a statement on its official KCNA news agency, North Korea's foreign ministry lashed out against the latest sanctions, saying the US is intimidated by the nation's nuclear power. <br /><br />&quot;The United States, completely terrified at our accomplishment ... is getting more and more frenzied in the moves to impose the harshest-ever sanctions and pressure on our country,&quot; the statement said.<br /><br />North Korea warned that if the United States &quot;wishes to live safely, it must abandon its hostile policy&quot; toward North Korea.<br /><br />&quot;We define this 'sanctions resolution' rigged up by the US and its followers as a grave infringement upon the sovereignty of our Republic, as an act of war violating peace and stability in the Korean peninsula,&quot; the statement said.<br /><br />It described the new resolution as a &quot;complete economic blockade&quot; and threatened nations that helped pass it.<br /><br />&quot;Those countries that raised their hands in favor of this 'sanctions resolution' shall be held completely responsible for all the consequences to be caused by the 'resolution' and we will make sure for ever and ever that they pay heavy price for what they have done,&quot; the statement said.<br /><br />It said the US should &quot;wake up from its pipe dream of our country giving up nuclear weapons.&quot; <br /><br />The US State Department said Sunday it had no comment on North Korea's latest rhetoric, citing its past condemnations of the regime. The White House and National Security Council did not immediately respond to requests for comment.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">November missile test</span><br /><br />Last month, North Korea said it successfully tested a new type of ICBM, which it claimed was topped with a &quot;super-large heavy warhead&quot; and capable of striking the US mainland.<br /><br />The Hwasong-15 missile reached the highest altitude ever recorded by a North Korean missile.<br /><br />The country launched it despite repeated warnings from US President Donald Trump. Commenting on the missile test, US Defense Secretary James Mattis said it demonstrated North Korea had the ability to hit &quot;everywhere in the world.&quot; <br /><br />Photos of the weapon released by North Korean state media showed a large, tall missile that appeared to be significantly wider than the Hwasong-14, previously Pyongyang's most-advanced missile. <br /><br />Experts said it seemed to be a significant advancement, adding North Korea's claims about the Hwasong-15's range and carrying capability should be taken seriously. Some even compared it to Titan II, the largest and heaviest missile ever built by the US, during the Cold War. <br /><br />Following the launch, a North Korean official told CNN Pyongyang was not interested in diplomacy with the US until it had fully demonstrated its nuclear capabilities.<br /><br />Reiterating remarks made in the past, the official said one step in this process was to conduct an above-ground nuclear detonation or &quot;large-scale hydrogen bomb&quot; test. The other was the &quot;testing of a long-range ICBM,&quot; the implication being this had been achieved with the most recent launch.<br /><br />A government statement said the Hwasong-15 &quot;is the most powerful ICBM which meets the goal of the completion of the rocket weaponry system development set by (North Korea).&quot;<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />Some Key background information:<br /><br />•Over the summer of 2017, North Korea grew increasingly provocative, threatening the US Pacific territory of Guam and Japan. Donald Trump responded by saying the US was ready to respond militarily if it was forced to defend itself or its allies. <br /><br />•On November 29, 2017, North Korea said it successfully tested a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), which it claimed was topped with a &quot;super-large heavy warhead&quot; and capable of striking the US mainland.<br /><br />•On December 4, 2017, the United States and South Korea started the largest-ever joint air military exercise. North Korea condemned the exercise as a &quot;dangerous military provocation,&quot; and pushed the Korean Peninsula toward the &quot;edge of nuclear war.&quot;<br /><br />•On December 24, 2017, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted US-drafted sanctions against North Korea . The sanctions will further strangle its energy supplies and tighten restrictions on smuggling and the use of North Korean workers overseas. Pyongyang responded that the UN sanctions against North Korea are an &quot;act of war,&quot; adding that the US and other nations which supported the strict measures will pay a heavy price. <br /><br />•On December 26, 2017, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Russia is ready to serve as a mediator between North Korea and the United States if both sides agree. <br /><br />•Trump tweeted on December 29, 2017: “Caught RED HANDED - very disappointed that China is allowing oil to go into North Korea. There will never be a friendly solution to the North Korea problem if this continues to happen!”<br /><br />1.Why does North Korea want to demonstrate its capabilities in nuclear weapons through nuclear and ICBM tests?<br />2.As China has close tie with North Korea, why it doesn’t want to rein in North Korea?<br />3.Until recently, the US and North Korea are exchanging words of war. Do you think there’s going to be a war between these two countries? Or, do you think they will go to the negotiation table to solve the problems?<br />4.What’s the worst-case scenario would be, if the tensions between US and North Korea as well as in Korean Peninsula continue to escalate? What’s the impact on the world economy (including stock markets) and geopolitical stabilities? Do you think this will become one of the black swan events in 2018?<br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:05pm discussion session (35 mins)<br />8:05 ~ 8:20pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:20 ~ 8:25pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:25 ~ 8:35pm Taking a 10 minutes break (Intermission)<br />8:35 ~ 9:10pm discussion session (35 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~ 9:30pm Concluding remarks/feedback from newcomers<br />The meeting place of Thursday:<br />摩斯漢堡明曜店 (明曜百貨後面第二條巷子地下室)<br />台北市大安區仁愛路四段151巷37號B1樓<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運 - 板南線 - 忠孝敦化站 (步行約5分鐘)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.帶著開放與熱情來學英文<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=827">Jason Tang</a> — Sun Dec 31, 2017 12:50 pm</p><hr />
