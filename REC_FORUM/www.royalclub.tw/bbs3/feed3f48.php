<span style="color: #FF0000">Thursday gathering of Royal Club is relocated to Ikari 怡客咖啡, 台北市衡陽路116號</span><br /><br />Session I: Mid-Autumn Festival<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.visitsingapore.com/festivals-events-singapore/cultural-festivals/mid-autumn-festival/">https://www.visitsingapore.com/festival ... -festival/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />One of the loveliest Chinese festivals, the Mid-Autumn Festival in Singapore celebrates the end of the autumn harvest with family gatherings, lanterns and mooncakes.<br />Marking the end of the autumn harvest, the Mid-Autumn Festival was traditionally a time to give thanks to the gods.<br />It is also a time of year that the moon is at its brightest, which is why lunar legends have always been attached to the celebration. One of the most notable is the story of Chang Er, the wife of a merciless king who downed the elixir of immortality he had intended to drink, so as to save her people from his tyrannical rule.<br />The tale goes that she ascended to the moon upon her brave act, and has been worshipped by the Chinese as a Moon Goddess ever since.<br />When dusk falls<br /><br />Since the Mid-Autumn Festival is about lunar appreciation, celebrations go into full swing once the sun goes down.<br />Moon-viewing parties are a popular way to enjoy the occasion, as family and friends sit in gardens lit by the soft glow of paper lanterns, sip tea, nibble on mooncakes, and if so inspired, compose poetry in venerable Tang Dynasty fashion.<br />Lanterns all a-glow<br />Children love this festival because they get to tote lanterns. The traditional lanterns with wax candles are made from paper and shaped into everything from cars to cartoon characters. As a sign of the times, there are also plastic, battery-operated versions.<br />You’ll get to examine the former up close at some of the celebrations around the island, particularly in Chinatown where large beautiful lanterns will be on display—marvels of creativity, artistry and traditional craftsmanship.<br />Mad about mooncakes<br /><br />Without a doubt, mooncakes are the main highlight of the Mid-Autumn Festival. Legend has it that they helped to free Yuan China from Mongol rule, after rebels organised an uprising by passing messages hidden in these seasonal pastries.<br />Today, you’ll find them in many varieties, from traditional flavours with lotus seed paste and egg yolk, to snowskin versions filled with everything from chocolate to champagne truffle. They are best enjoyed with a strong, palate-cleansing cup of Chinese tea.<br /><br />Festival goes virtual<br />The Mid-Autumn Festival in 2020 goes virtual with new digital activities and experiences for the family and loved ones. Held from 19 September to 16 October 2020, the festival will stream the light-up to audiences on social media.<br />In addition, families can participate in online activities such as mooncake making and lantern painting. The former includes tutorial videos featuring Tai Thong Cake Shop while the latter provides DIY lantern kits for families to download and paint.<br /><br />Another highlight includes Zoom Escape Room: Chronicles of Chinatown where up to 60 registered participants will travel back in time to the 19th century and uncover the history of Chinatown through puzzles.<br /><br />Discussion:<br />1. There are many kinds of moon cake. What is your favorite flavor? Do you still present moon cake gift sets to persons meaningful to you? Why/Why not? <br />2. After Mr. Armstrong stepping on the Moon I wonder what the significance is about moon festival to you. Do you forget Chang’e, the Moon Goddess of Immortality?  <br />3. The traditional activities of moon festival are fading away. Were there any folk customs you do on this moon festival? <br />4. One moon cake contains 500 to 1,000 calories and equal to two bowls of white rice. How do you enjoy moon cake without gaining weight / high blood sugar? Do you eat with enough vegetables?<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Session II: Berlin Film Festival to make acting prizes gender neutral<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/lang/archives/2020/08/31/2003742547">https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/lang/a ... 2003742547</a><!-- m --><br /><br />The organizers of the Berlin International Film Festival (aka Berlinale) said last Monday that they will stop awarding separate acting prizes to women and men beginning next year, and the performance awards will be defined in a gender-neutral way at next year’s festival, for which a physical event is planned.<br />The festival awards a Golden Bear for the best film and a series of Silver Bears, which until this year included best actor and best actress honors. Organizers said those prizes will be replaced with a Silver Bear for Best Leading Performance and a Silver Bear for Best Supporting Performance.<br /><br />In a statement, the co-heads of the festival, Mariette Rissenbeek and Carlo Chatrian, said “not separating the awards in the acting field according to gender comprises a signal for a more gender-sensitive awareness in the film industry.”<br />The festival’s Golden Bear is one of the most prestigious awards in Europe, together with the Palme d’Or of the Cannes festival in France and the Golden Lion award of the Venice Film Festival. Cannes still singles out a best actor and actress, while Venice awards a Volpi cup to actors of each sex.<br /><br />At the same time, the Alfred Bauer Prize, which is named after the festival’s founding director, will be permanently retired. The prize was suspended this year due to revelations about Bauer’s role in the Nazis’ moviemaking bureaucracy.<br />Commenting on the decision to hold a physical event next year, despite uncertainties due to the coronavirus pandemic, the two directors stressed the need for a “lively relationship with the audience.” “In times of the corona pandemic, it has become even clearer that we still require analogue experience spaces in the cultural realm,” they said, noting that other festivals have also resumed holding physical rather than virtual events. The 2021 festival is scheduled for Feb. 11-21.<br /><br />Discussion:<br />1. Are you a father / mother who regards sons as superior to daughters? Why/why not?<br />2. What is gender sensitive? How would you tell / educate your children to have gender sensitive awareness? <br />3. The Berlin International Film Festival will only have prizes for Best Leading Performance and Best Supporting Performance next year. There will be no more best actor and best actress honors.<br />How do you feel about the change?<br />4. Which best actor / best actress you admire most? Tell the reasons.<br />5. What kind of movie you like more? Can you recommend some films you like?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=25437">Michael</a> — Sat Oct 03, 2020 10:41 pm</p><hr />
