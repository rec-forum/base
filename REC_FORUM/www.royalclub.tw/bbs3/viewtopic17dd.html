Russian is the biggest natural gas exporter and second-largest for oil, also the biggest exporter of wheat in the world. The war will trigger the inflation dramatically. Do you make any preparation to face it? <br /><br />2.Noted that Russia and Ukraine together produce 70% of the world’s neon, critical in the making of semiconductors. Both countries account for 30% of the world’s exports of wheat, 19% of corn and 80% of sunflower oil, which is used in food processing. The price surge will definitely devastate poor countries and the world.   Will the price shift and material shortage affect the world? <br /><br />3.Global financial markets have been thrown into turmoil by the invasion. Economists expect the conflict will complicate decisions for global central banks to raise interest rates. Where to put your money and what’s your investment strategy?<br /><br />4.Do you know what is “SWIFT”?  Why did the world impose” SWIFT” sanction to Russian?<br /><br /><br />Articles 2: Life is easy.

Are you willing to go back to the simple life and move to the countryside?<br />3.In order to buy a house in the city, it may take you 30-40 working years to afford it. But why most people still chose to live in Northern Taiwan?  <br />4.What is the meaning of your life?  To work hard, earn money to buy a luxurious car, clothes and big houses.</div>
