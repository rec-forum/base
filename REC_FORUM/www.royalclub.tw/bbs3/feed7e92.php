02/16 “Chinese New Year 2019”&amp;”If the factory closes what could I afford to eat?”(host: Ivonne Sung)<br /><br />Article I: Chinese New Year 2019<br />LINK: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.history.com/topics/holidays/chinese-new-year">https://www.history.com/topics/holidays ... e-new-year</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Chinese New Year is the most important holiday in China. In 2019, Chinese New Year begins on February 5 and marks the beginning of the Year of the Pig. Tied to the Chinese lunar calendar, the holiday was traditionally a time to honor household and heavenly deities as well as ancestors. It was also a time to bring family together for feasting. With the popular adoption of the Western calendar in 1912, the Chinese joined in celebrating January 1 as New Year’s Day. China, however, continues to celebrate Chinese New Year with the traditional greeting, “Kung hei fat choi.”<br /><br />Lunar New Year<br />The ancient Chinese lunar calendar, on which Chinese New Year is based, functioned as a religious, dynastic and social guide. Oracle bones inscribed with astronomical records indicate that the calendar existed as early as 14th century B.C., when the Shang Dynasty was in power.<br /><br />The calendar’s structure wasn’t static: It was reset according to which emperor held power and varied from one region to another.<br /><br />The Chinese calendar was a complex timepiece. Its parameters were set according to the lunar phases as well as the solar solstices and equinoxes. Yin and yang, the opposing but complementary principles that make up a harmonious world, also ruled the calendar.<br /><br />Chinese New Year typically begins with the new moon that occurs between the end of January and the end of February, and it lasts about 15 days, until the full moon arrives with the Festival of Lanterns.<br /><br /><br />Chinese New Year Animals<br />The Chinese calendar also included the Chinese zodiac, the cycle of twelve stations or “signs” along the apparent path of the sun through the cosmos.<br /><br />Each new year was marked by the characteristics of one of the 12 zodiac animals: the rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog and pig.<br /><br />Chinese New Year Traditions<br />The traditional Chinese New Year was the most important festival on the calendar. The entire attention of the household was fixed on the celebration. During this time, business life came nearly to a stop. Home and family were the principal focuses.<br /><br />In preparation for the holiday, houses were thoroughly cleaned to rid them of “huiqi,” or inauspicious breaths, which might have collected during the old year. Cleaning was also meant to appease the gods who would be coming down from heaven to make inspections.<br /><br />Ritual sacrifices of food and paper icons were offered to gods and ancestors. People posted scrolls printed with lucky messages on household gates and set off firecrackers to frighten evil spirits. Elders gave out money to children.<br /><br />In fact, many of the rites carried out during this period were meant to bring good luck to the household and long life to the family—particularly to the parents.<br /><br />Chinese New Year Food<br />Most important was the feasting: On New Year’s Eve, the extended family would join around the table for a meal that included as the last course a fish that was symbolic of abundance and therefore not meant to be eaten.<br /><br />In the first five days of the New Year, people ate long noodles to symbolize long life. On the 15th and final day of the New Year, round dumplings shaped like the full moon were shared as a sign of the family unit and of perfection.<br /><br /><br />Spring Festival<br />The Western-style Gregorian calendar arrived in China along with Jesuit missionaries in 1582. It began to be used by the general population by 1912, and New Year’s Day was officially recognized as occurring on January 1.<br /><br />Beginning in 1949, under the rule of Chinese Communist Party leader Mao Zedong, the government forbade celebration of the traditional Chinese New Year and followed the Gregorian calendar in its dealings with the West.<br /><br />But at the end of the 20th century, Chinese leaders were more willing to accept the Chinese tradition. In 1996, China instituted a weeklong vacation during the holiday—now called Spring Festival—giving people the opportunity to travel home and to celebrate the new year.<br /><br />Did you know? San Francisco, California, claims its Chinese New Year parade is the biggest celebration of its kind outside of Asia. The city has hosted a Chinese New Year celebration since the Gold Rush era of the 1860s, a period of large-scale Chinese immigration to the region.<br /><br />In the early 21st century, many Chinese families spent a significant amount of their discretionary income celebrating the Spring Festival with traditional symbols and food. They also spent time watching the televised Spring Festival Gala: an annual variety show featuring traditional and contemporary singers, dancers and magic demonstrations.<br /><br />Although the rites of the holiday no longer had religious value, people remained sensitive to the zodiac animals to the extent that they considered what, for example, a Year of the Pig in 2019 might mean for their personal fortunes or for a child born at that time.<br /><br />A change in attitude toward the Spring Festival has occurred in China’s young people, with Chinese college students reporting that they prefer surfing the Internet, sleeping, watching TV or spending time with friends over celebrating with family. They also reported not liking traditional New Year food such as dumplings and glutinous rice pastry.<br /><br />With its change of name from Chinese New Year to Spring Festival, for some members of the younger generation the holiday has evolved from an opportunity to renew family ties to a chance for relaxation from work.<br /><br />Discussions~<br />1.

Mr Loo says that the industry employs more than 700,000 people, 85% of whom are women.<br /><br />Meanwhile, official EU figures show that Cambodian clothing exports to Europe reached €3.8bn ($4.3bn; £3.4bn) in 2017. That is 44% of all Cambodia's $9.6bn exports last year.<br /><br />No wonder then that there are fears over the possibility of significant factory closures and job losses, not only if the EU does end Cambodia's tariff-free status, but simply as a result of the threat.<br /><br />George McLeod, an economic and political risk analyst based in Bangkok, says that Western clothing firms could easily switch production to Bangladesh, Vietnam or Indonesia.<br /><br />For Sao Run, who has a three-year-old son to support, this is now a real concern. &quot;The local union in our factory told us that the factory could close if the [EU] taxes are high,&quot; she says.<br /><br />&quot;For me, if the factory closes, what could I afford to eat?&quot;<br /><br />Another clothing industry factory worker, Yon Chansy, 24, says that she found out about the EU's threat via Facebook, and that she is also now worried she may lose her job.<br /><br />&quot;I could consider migrating to Thailand if the situation in our country is very bad,&quot; she says.<br /><br />For its part, the Cambodian government may now be prepared to compromise, but whether it does enough remains to be seen.<br /><br />Last week the country's parliament (in which the government holds all the seats) said it would review a ban on more than 100 members of the opposition CNRP, but no timetable was given. Nor was there any indication of whether fresh elections would be held, or if the leader of the CNRP would be released from house arrest.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the government has been downplaying the importance of the EU market. Ministry of Industry and Handicraft spokesperson Oum Sotha told the BBC: &quot;The market of Cambodia does not solely depend on Europe, we have a lot of markets.&quot;<br /><br />Sebastian Strangio, journalist and author of a book called Hun Sen's Cambodia, says the Cambodian government faces a real dilemma over the EU issue.<br /><br />&quot;The problem is that the 'clear and demonstrable improvements' the EU is demanding would, almost by definition, weaken Hun Sen's hold on power,&quot; he says.<br /><br />&quot;This he will never accept. It is therefore hard to see how the two sides will find common ground. Any concessions the Cambodian government makes will fall short of meaningful democratic reforms.<br /><br />&quot;Whether or not the EU will accept something cosmetic remains to be seen.&quot;<br /><br />A source at the European Commission says the announcement that the ban on the Cambodian opposition might be lifted was &quot;a first positive step&quot;.<br /><br />&quot;However, this needs to produce concrete and substantial results to alleviate the EU's serious concerns. The implementation of this announcement and concrete changes on the ground would be among the deciding factors,&quot; she added.<br /><br />Tieng Ratana, a mother-of-three who works at a clothing factory to the west of Phnom Penh, says she hopes that the Cambodian government will think of people like her.<br /><br />&quot;We work very hard, so I really want our leaders to think about the workers first,&quot; she says.<br /><br />Discussions~<br />Q1) what point have you learned from this article?<br /><br />Q2)if the government did not improve political freedom and human rights in the country, the EU withdrew Cambodia’s preferential tariff regime? why?<br /><br />Q3)Do you have any real concern about Taiwan economy?<br /><br />Q4)How much do you know about Cambodia?<br /><br /><br /><br />Agenda<br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:25pm discussion session <br />8:25 ~ 8:30pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:30 ~9:30pm discussion session<br />(Session III)<br />9:30pm Free talk<br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=12531">Danny Lin</a> — Tue Feb 12, 2019 11:21 pm</p><hr />
