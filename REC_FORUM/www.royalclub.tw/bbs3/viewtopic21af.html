Do you think there is a ceiling on how long human beings can live?  Do you agree that there is a &quot;mortality plateau&quot; as mentioned in the first article?<br />2.      If possible, to what age do you wish to live?  Why?<br />3.      Do your goals and desires change at different stages of your life? What life goals do you think you would have if you can live very long?<br />4.      If you could wish for just one thing, would it be happiness or a long life?<br />5.

Do you think taste is innate or acquired?  If acquired, can you acquire a taste for anything?<br />2.      Do you love or hate the following foods: black coffee, blue cheese, sushi, dark chocolate, oysters, pickles, kimchi, liver, and cilantro?  Do you think they are simply good, truly bad, or actually an acquired taste?<br />3.      What kind of new foods have you tried recently?  What is the most bizarre food you have ever tried?  What is a food that you hated as a child but now love to eat?<br />4.      Do you love to try creative or exotic foods (say, Domino's bubble milk tea pizza), or do you have a distinctive fixation on food and just want your food to “taste good”? What type of food do you like most?<br />5.      How would you describe Taiwanese food culture?<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">P.S.<br />1.因聚會地點是在咖啡店內，所以有低消80元喔。<br />2.參加三次後，只要繳交1,000元(學生500元)，即可成為ROYAL終身會員!<br />3.請帶著開放與熱情來參加自由的全英文會話聚會~</span></div>
