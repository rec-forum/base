<span style="font-weight: bold">Session I: Outrage in China over thousands of faulty vaccines for children</span><br /><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/07/23/asia/faulty-vaccine-china-intl/index.html" class="postlink">https://edition.cnn.com/2018/07/23/asia/faulty-vaccine-china-intl/index.html</a><br /><br />(CNN) — Hundreds of thousands of vaccines provided for Chinese children have been found to be faulty, inciting widespread fury and prompting the country's President, Xi Jinping, to describe the incident as &quot;vile and shocking.&quot;<br /><br />China's Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) has launched an investigation into vaccine manufacturer Changchun Changsheng Biotechnology, revoking its license for human rabies vaccines and beginning a recall of all unused vaccines produced by the company.<br /><br />Five senior executives of the company, including the chairwoman, were taken into custody for questioning by Changchun police, who announced they had begun an official criminal investigation into the company.<br /><br />In Chinese, the term Changsheng is a play on words meaning &quot;long life.&quot;<br /><br />Online message boards have been inundated with hundreds of thousands of comments since the news broke Sunday, with parents and consumers using the hashtag &quot;#Changsheng bio-tech vaccine incident,&quot; to post reactions on Weibo, a Chinese platform likened to Twitter. <br /><br />&quot;My home country, how can I trust you? You just let me down again and again,&quot; one user said. &quot;Our trust has been overdrawn again and again, it's so irresponsible for everyone's life,&quot; said another.<br /><br />Many of the defective vaccines were already on the market and being given to Chinese children, as part of the mandatory national vaccination program. A number have now been recalled, but there is no information at this stage as to how they could affect the health of those children who have already been injected.<br /><br />One mother, surnamed Zhen from Baoding, Hebei province, told CNN she had found out since the announcement her six-year-old daughter was vaccinated with a Changsheng product.<br /><br />&quot;I'm kind of at loss. I have to wait for official conclusions,&quot; she said over Wechat.<br /><br />Zhen said she'd been supportive of products made in China, unlike a number of her contemporaries who &quot;worship&quot; foreign products.<br />&quot;But this incident ... it also made me deeply concerned. It will be really hard to rebuild people's confidence in our national brands. After all, children are parents' lifeblood,&quot; she said.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">'Thorough' investigation promised</span><br /><br />At least two different vaccines -- rabies, and diphtheria and tetanus (DPT) -- manufactured by Changchun Changsheng Biotechnology are known to be defective. <br /><br />State-run Xinhua news agency reports that at least 113,000 doses of the company's rabies vaccine are affected. <br /><br />In a statement, the Jilin Provincial Food and Drug Administration said a total of 253,338 doses of Changsheng's DPT vaccine were faulty. This batch was sold to the Shandong Provincial Disease Prevention and Control Center.<br /><br />It follows an earlier incident, in November 2017, when at least another 400,000 doses of the same vaccine, produced by a different, second company, the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products, were found to be substandard.<br /><br />Eight provinces or cities immediately announced they would be stopping or suspending the use of human rabies vaccine from Changsheng, while another four claimed they had never used it.<br /><br />It is not known whether other regional disease control agencies have been affected.<br /><br />The Changsheng vaccine issues first became public following an official government inspection of the company's facilities on July 15, in which authorities found that the company had fabricated production and testing records, falsified production specifications and equipment, CFDA officials said in a briefing on Sunday. <br /><br />Despite being overseas on Monday on a visit to Africa, President Xi was briefed on the vaccine crisis and said ensuring the safety of drugs was the responsibility of the government and the Communist Party.<br /><br />He called for authorities to &quot;scrape the poison off the bone&quot; in their efforts to rectify the vaccine problems.<br /><br />On Sunday, Premier Li Keqiang, the country's number two leader, announced a &quot;thorough&quot; investigation of China's vaccine production and sales process, saying the incident had &quot;broke people's moral bottom line.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Those involved will be resolutely punished with zero tolerance. (The government) will resolutely crack down on all illegal and criminal acts that endanger the safety of people's lives,&quot; a statement released by China's Central Government said.<br /><br />The vaccine crisis will undermine attempts by authorities to rebuild the public's trust in Chinese food and medicines after a series of wide-scale controversies in the past decade.<br /><br />In a statement released to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, the management of Changsheng said it felt &quot;very ashamed and guilty&quot; over the vaccines.<br /><br />&quot;The company will learn a lesson and take practical corrective measures and rectify thoroughly,&quot; the statement said.<br />For their mistake, Changsheng was fined 3,442,887 yuan ($507,843) by the Chinese government.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">'A test of a modern country's governance'</span><br /><br />State-run tabloid the Global Times said in an unusually blunt editorial Sunday the provision of safe vaccines for the population was &quot;a test of a modern country's governance.&quot;<br /><br />Another state media publication, China Daily, said in an editorial the same day transparency was needed if the public was going to be satisfied.<br /><br />&quot;The authorities need to release whatever information they know about the incident to the public as soon as possible,&quot; the article said.<br /><br />The vaccine scandal is just the latest in a series of controversies surrounding fake or defective products produced in China.<br /><br />In 2008, about 300,000 Chinese infants became sick after drinking tainted milk formula, triggering a countrywide rush to buy internationally-produced baby products in Hong Kong and abroad.<br /><br />Years later, almost half of Chinese food-processing plants still failed to meet internationally acceptable standards, according to a 2015 report. <br /><br />Even condiments such as soy sauce and spice mix haven't escaped the fake goods scares, after authorities in northern China busted several factories making counterfeit versions of the popular products in 2017.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />1.Outrage in China over thousands of faulty vaccines for children in recent years. Please share your comments with your team members.<br />2.Fake vaccine scandal in China is causing a crisis of confidence. Do you agree or not? Why?<br />3.If your six-year-old daughter was vaccinated with a Changsheng product. What do you take actions?  <br />4.Please share you or your family vaccination experience or opinion at your table. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Session II: 10 Key Andy Grove Quotes on Leadership from High Output Management</span><br /><a href="https://getlighthouse.com/blog/andy-grove-quotes-leadership-high-output-management/" class="postlink">https://getlighthouse.com/blog/andy-grove-quotes-leadership-high-output-management/</a><br /><br />Andy Grove Quotes Andy Grove is one of best CEOs ever. He co-founded Intel and grew it to over $20 Billion in revenue over a 30 year run as CEO. His approaches to leadership and management are legendary. He’s shared many of his ideas in a series of books, including the management guide, High Output Management.  I highly recommend the book for any manager, as do others:<br /><br />The following Andy Grove quotes are my favorites from the book, which has a lot more depth and ideas well worth learning for any manager.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">1) You can be a great manager regardless of your situation.</span><br /><br />“As a middle manager, you are in effect a chief executive of an organization yourself….As a micro CEO, you can improve your own and your group’s performance and productivity, whether or not the rest of the company follows suit.”<br /><br />Be great no matter what’s happening in the rest of your company. Don’t use the failings of those around you as an excuse; great management will make your team follow you anywhere you go.<br /><br />Especially in larger organizations, you may not be able to change or fix everything, but you can do a lot to help shield your team and make their lives better.<br /><br />If you produce solid results (and good management will help you do so), in most cases your company well give you leeway to continue what you’re doing, even if it’s not standard in the company. Don’t wait for permission to be a good manager for your team; take the initiative yourself. Your team will thank you.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">2) Fix Problems when they’re small</span><br /><br />“A common rule we should always try to heed is to detect and fix any problem at the lowest-value stage possible.”<br />It bears repeating: Fix problems when they’re small! As a manager, you have plenty of tools to detect them if you just listen to your team.<br /><br />Don’t wait until you have a major crisis on your hands.  By then, it will take a ton of your time to address and it risks putting you into a reactive management mode that is hard to break out of.<br /><br />This is where one-on-ones can help (more on this later) as well as surveys and open communication with your team. The key is to be sure you’re asking the right questions, and following through on what you hear.  If you don’t ask, you won’t know, and if you don’t follow through, your team will stop telling you about things you need to know.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">3) Measure what’s important and set a standard</span><br /><br />“Measurement against a standard makes you think through WHY the results were what they were.”<br />You manage what you measure. The act of planning and then creating a way to measure the result: a number, a deadline, etc will have many benefits beyond just the assigned task.<br /><br />Measurement also makes you think in ways you may not always think if you’re rushing around all the time. It sets the expectations for your people on what they must do and how their work will be evaluated.  As Dale Carnegie recommends, “Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to” and with the right measure, you might just be surprised the results you will get.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">4) Time is your scarcest resource as a manager</span><br /><br /> “The single most important resource that we allocate from one day to the next is our own time.”<br />Managers must ruthlessly manage their time. Consider it an investment (Grove, even in writing the book in 1983, valued a manager’s time at $100/hr). Avoid being in constant, reactive management and focus on priority management not time management.<br /><br />As Grove puts it, ‘When you say “yes” to one thing, you are inevitably saying “no” to another.”<br /><br />You can find yourself in meetings all day every day if you’re not careful, but that’s no way to be effective and keeps you from many other important activities.  Budget your time and invest in yourself by blocking off time for big picture thinking and not shortchanging the investment in your people with regular time for one-on-ones. <br /><br />Further Reading: Need to find more hours in the day? Learn how to better budget your time via priority management here.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">5) Leading by example trumps everything else</span><br /><br />“Values and behavioral norms are simply not transmitted easily by talk or memo, but are conveyed very effective by doing and doing visibly.”<br /><br />Lead by example. What you do is what your team will emulate and believe is expected and valued. Ask yourself: What is your team emulating from you…both good and bad? Grove believes, “The responsibility for transmitting common values rests squarely with the supervisor.”<br /><br />In Ben Horowitz’s book, The Hard Thing About Hard Things, one of the stories he recalls is that his swearing was picked up by the rest of his team. It ended up becoming a big issue and he had to explain to the whole company exactly the kind of swearing that would and would not be acceptable at the company and set his own example to follow it.<br /><br />Even simple things are noted by your team.<br /><br />This is especially true and important when considering promotions. When you promote someone, it signals to the rest of the organization what is valued most (promotions are a huge reward with many benefits after all).<br /><br />Someone who lives a value and is promoted will set an example for others, while someone who is not a good example, but was promoted anyways, says that behavior is not just tolerated, but rewarded.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">6) Delegate what you know best</span><br /><br />“Because it is easier to monitor something with which you are familiar, if you have a choice you should delegate those activities you know best.”<br /><br />This may seem counter-intuitive. It was to me when I first read it, but Grove’s case makes a lot of sense.<br /><br />If you’re familiar with a task, it’s easier to tell if someone else is well-qualified to take it on.  Also, once they’re doing the task, you’ll need less oversight to tell if things are going well or not.  This helps everyone win, as you’re less likely to make a hiring mistake, and won’t be as likely to need to micro-manage.<br /><br />Now, don’t confuse delegation with abdication; you still need to monitor work to maintain quality and to make your team feel connected and appreciated. The best way to do that is to look at rough drafts, so you catch problems while they can still be privately fixed as well as give specific feedback that will shape the outcome you desire.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">7) Regular one-on-ones are a high value investment</span><br /><br />“Ninety minutes of your time can enhance the quality of your subordinate’s work for two weeks, or for some eighty-plus hours.”<br />One-on-ones matter. A lot. Ben Horowitz was willing to fire over someone not having one-on-ones. If you’re not having them, get started now and if you’re canceling one-on-ones a lot now, get committed.<br /><br />This is a meeting that’s an investment in your team. They’re humans, not robots.<br /><br />You will have different situations to always handle and fix, and as we discussed in #2, you want to catch problems when they’re small. That’s where one-on-ones come in because they’re lower pressure than coming to your office or interrupting you, no matter how open your open door policy is.<br /><br />Remember, one-on-ones are about them as Grove writes,“the most important criterion governing matters to be talked about is that they be issues that preoccupy and nag the subordinate.” <br /><br />Having these discussions every week or two ensures no problem goes too long without being addressed.<br /><br />Want to have awesome 1 on 1s like Andy Grove? Then sign up for a free trial of Lighthouse, because it’s based on many of the principles in High Output Management.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">8) When your team member shares something important, write it down</span><br /><br />“Equally important is what “writing it down” symbolizes…the act implies a commitment, like a handshake, that something will be done. The supervisor, also having taken notes, can then follow up at the next one-on-one.”<br /><br />Don’t take notes in your one-on-ones? You should. They WANT you to.<br /><br />If a team member takes the time to bring it up, it matters to them. They want you to take action, not just talk about it. So take your notes and set some action items by the end of your one-on-ones and other critical meetings.<br /><br />With how busy the average manager is, it’s a mistake to assume you’ll remember something later. Even if you can remember, you’re stressing your brain to juggling that and the many other items competing for your attention each day.  It shouldn’t be surprising that things are easily forgotten when that is the case.  Fortunately, an app like Lighthouse can help you stay organized and manage those action items for you and your team member for those crucial one-on-one discussions.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">9) Your team often has more perspective than you</span><br /><br />“We managers get a little more obsolete every day.”<br /><br />As you rise in the ranks and spend more time managing, realize you become disconnected from the experiences you have as an individual contributor. Be careful to not lose touch. Trust your people to help you stay grounded.<br /><br />This is why the Toyota Total Production System is focused on getting insights from the front lines. There they train their managers to get feedback and insights directly from people on the assembly line. Tap your team for insights when you can and reward candor. You need the harsh truth before you get blindsided.<br /><br />This is why Grove challenges managers to Ask: “What do I have to do today to solve — or better, avoid — tomorrow’s problem?”<br />If you’re always thinking about that, you’ll likely ask the right questions of your team to find out.<br /><br />Further Reading: Do you have managers reporting to you? If so, consider asking these questions in manager one on ones, and use skip level one on ones from time to time to get more direct feedback from the front lines of your company.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">10) Only you can save your team member from quitting</span><br /><br />“In almost all cases, the employee is quitting because he feels he is not important… If you do not deal with the situation right at the first mention, you’ll confirm his feelings and the outcome is inevitable.”<br /><br />If you’re at risk to lose someone from your team, you must act immediately. A lot has to happen for someone to want to interview and change jobs and so the status quo will not keep them. Grove outlines 5 key steps to save a lost employee:<br />   1.Drop what you’re doing. Sit down and ask why they’re quitting.<br />   2.Listen to everything they have to say, and ask questions to clarify.<br />   3.Don’t try to change their mind at that moment. Instead, look for opportunities to change things in the ways they want.<br />   4.You MUST follow through on whatever you commit to doing. You become the Project Manager of the solution to keeping them.<br />   5.Even if you will lose them to another department, you owe it to the company to keep them in the company. Karma will pay you back some day.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Questions:</span><br />1.According to 10 Key Andy Grove Quotes on Leadership from High Output Management, please share 3 points with your team members.<br />2.“Fix Problems when they’re small.” Please share your comments and experiences.<br />3.Do you agree with “Regular one-on-ones are a high value investment”? Why or Why not?<br />4.If you’re at risk to lose someone from your team, what do you do immediately based on your experience or share some stories.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Agenda</span><br />7:00-7:25 Greetings and free talk<br />7:25-7:30 Opening remarks/ Newcomers self-introduction/ Grouping<br />(Session I)<br />7:30 ~ 8:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />8:10 ~ 8:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />8:25 ~ 8:30pm Regrouping<br />(Session II)<br />8:30 ~9:10pm discussion session (40 mins)<br />9:10 ~9:25pm summarization (15 mins)<br />9:25 ~9:30pm Concluding remarks/feedback from newcomers<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">The meeting place of Thursday:</span><br />丹堤咖啡寶慶店：台北市延平南路107號2F (上樓右邊第一區塊)<br />捷運資訊： 近台北捷運–西門站 (4號出口步行約2分鐘，康是美隔壁)<br />丹堤低消: NT$80元<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500，帶著開放與熱情來學英文<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=827">Jason Tang</a> — Sat Aug 04, 2018 9:56 pm</p><hr />
