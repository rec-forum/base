Do you think that shame is a negative thing, why or why not?<br />Q2. Is there a positive side to shame?<br />Q3. What are we ashamed of?<br />Q4. What makes you feel shame? How about your story?<br />Q5. What is a modern concept of shame? Does it have anything to do with social media?<br />Session II<br />Top 2 Tips on Reading English the Easy Way<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.eslpod.com/eslpod_blog/2019/07/02/top-2-tips-on-reading-english-the-easy-way/">https://www.eslpod.com/eslpod_blog/2019 ... -easy-way/</a><!-- m --><br />Listen and reading are the two main (most important) ways to improve your English.<br />Listening is important, but reading is also VERY powerful!<br />Reading will actually improve your English listening and speaking, as well as reading and writing.<br />To get the most out of (to take maximum advantage of) your reading, you need to<br />(a) pick English books or magazines that you mostly understand (more than 90%) AND<br />(b) pick books that you actually like reading, that you enjoy.<br />How do you do this? Here are two simple tips to help you:<br />TIP 1: Read the types of things you already read in your own language and on topics you’re already familiar with.<br />Knowing something about a topic will it make much easier to read about it in English.<br />For example, I read the news in English every day. You could call me a news junkie (someone who likes something a lot, perhaps too much).<br />When I read the news in French, especially on topics I already know something about, the French is much easier to understand.<br />If I read a story in French (or Italian or Spanish) about the United States, I can understand it very easily, since I already know something about the topic or subject.<br />And because I have read the news nearly every day of my adult life, I’m familiar with the format (organization) of newspapers. I know how news stories are organized. This experience makes reading the news in another language much easier.<br />If you don’t like to read in your own language, no problem. Consider what kinds of things you like to do instead.<br />Like soccer? Read books and articles about soccer.<br />Like playing video games? Read books and magazines about video games.<br />Like watching romantic comedies? Read romances in English!<br />TIP 2: Read what needs improving.<br />Here’s what I mean by that: If your goal is to improve your English conversation, read a lot of conversational English.<br />Pick fiction (made-up stories) that have a lot of dialogue rather than long descriptions.<br />The additional advantage of reading dialogue is that it is easier to understand, making it easier to read.<br />(Hint: Reading our lesson transcripts would be a good way to get that conversational English, of course!)<br />If you want to improve your English on a more specialized (on a smaller or more limited subject) topic, read things on that subject.<br />For example, if you want to do better business presentations, read more business books.<br />This type of reading is called “narrow reading,” reading on a limited topic.<br />Narrow reading will help you get the style and language you need.<br />Narrow reading works especially well for fiction books that are part of a series (books with the same characters), such as Harry Potter or Twilight or The Hunger Games.<br />I’m reading right now a series of young-adult novels (written for 8-12 year-olds) with a mystery and spy theme in French. The main characters in each book of the series are the same, so I already know something about them (see Tip 1).<br />If you read one Harry Potter book, the next one will be much easier to understand.<br />But remember that *all* reading on whatever topic is helpful, as long as you can understand 90%+ and you enjoy it.<br />If you pick your reading materials according to these tips, you are more likely to stick with it (continue) and not get bored, discouraged, and give up (stop trying).<br />So what are you waiting for? Start reading today!<br />~Jeff<br />P.S. It’s okay to “give up on” or stop reading a certain book if, after 20 pages or so, it seems too difficult or too boring. Just find another book<br /><br />Q1. Is reading a very powerful way to improve English?<br />Q2. What do you think about reading will improve your English listening and speaking, as well as reading and writing?<br />Q3. Does the article encourage you to read English? <br />Q4. If you want to start reading English, which book will you choose? <br />Agenda<br />7:00 ~ 7:30 pm greetings &amp; free talk <br />7:30 ~ 8:15 pm guests introduced &amp; first session discussion <br />8:15 ~ 8:45 pm presentation, sharing the article &amp; other experiences <br />8:45 ~ 9:30 pm second session discussion<br /><br />Position: Dante coffee Shop (丹堤咖啡), MRT板南線 - 新埔站2號出口, next to 7-Seven, <br />板橋民生路二段237 號, <br />Time: PM 7:00-9:30, <br />a minimum charge of Dante coffee for Royal English club attendant NT$80 (丹提低消80元)<br />最自由的全英文會話聚會,前三次不用交會費,加入會員終生會費NT$500.請帶著開放與熱情來學英文<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://www.royalclub.tw/bbs3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=89">AndrewWang</a> — Mon Jul 22, 2019 11:44 pm</p><hr />
