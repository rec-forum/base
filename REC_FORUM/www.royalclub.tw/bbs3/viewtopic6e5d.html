It usually gets better by changing your sleeping habits.<br /><br />Check if you have insomnia<br />You have insomnia if you regularly:<br /><br />find it hard to go to sleep<br />wake up several times during the night<br />lie awake at night<br />wake up early and cannot go back to sleep<br />still feel tired after waking up<br />find it hard to nap during the day even though you're tired<br />feel tired and irritable during the day<br />find it difficult to concentrate during the day because you're tired<br />If you have insomnia for a short time (less than 3 months) it’s called short-term insomnia. Insomnia that lasts 3 months or longer is called long-term insomnia.<br /><br />Sleep self-assessment<br />Do you have a sleep problem?<br />Most people experience problems with sleep in their life. In fact, it's thought that a third of Brits will have episodes of insomnia at some point. <br /><br />The causes can include physical conditions, psychological conditions (such as depression or anxiety) or a combination of both.<br /><br />This short test from Sleepio will give you a 'sleep score' plus practical tips and advice for improving your sleep.<br /><br />Start<br />More information<br />How much sleep you need<br />Everyone needs different amounts of sleep.<br /><br />On average:<br /><br />adults need 7 to 9 hours<br />children need 9 to 13 hours<br />toddlers and babies need 12 to 17 hours<br />You probably do not get enough sleep if you're constantly tired during the day.<br /><br />What causes insomnia<br />The most common causes are:<br /><br />stress, anxiety or depression<br />noise<br />a room that's too hot or cold<br />uncomfortable beds<br />alcohol, caffeine or nicotine<br />recreational drugs like cocaine or ecstasy<br />jet lag<br />shift work<br />Conditions and other things that can cause insomnia<br />How you can treat insomnia yourself<br />Insomnia usually gets better by changing your sleeping habits.<br /><br />Do<br />go to bed and wake up at the same time every day<br /><br />relax at least 1 hour before bed, for example, take a bath or read a book<br /><br />make sure your bedroom is dark and quiet – use curtains, blinds, an eye mask or ear plugs if needed<br /><br />exercise regularly during the day<br /><br />make sure your mattress, pillows and covers are comfortable<br /><br />Don’t<br />do not smoke or drink alcohol, tea or coffee at least 6 hours before going to bed<br /><br />do not eat a big meal late at night<br /><br />do not exercise at least 4 hours before bed<br /><br />do not watch television or use devices, like smartphones, right before going to bed, because the bright light makes you more awake<br /><br />do not nap during the day<br /><br />do not drive when you feel sleepy<br /><br />do not sleep in after a bad night's sleep and stick to your regular sleeping hours instead<br /><br />How a pharmacist can help with insomnia<br />You can buy tablets or liquids (sometimes called sleeping aids) from a pharmacy that may help you sleep better.<br /><br />Some contain natural ingredients (valerian, lavender or melatonin) while others, like Nytol, are an antihistamine.<br /><br />They cannot cure insomnia but may help you sleep better for 1 to 2 weeks. They should not be taken for any longer.<br /><br />Some of these products can have side effects, for instance, they may make you drowsy. This could make it difficult for you to do certain things like drive.<br /><br />Check with your doctor before taking anything for your sleep problems.<br /><br />Non-urgent advice:See a GP if:<br />changing your sleeping habits has not worked<br />you have had trouble sleeping for months<br />your insomnia is affecting your daily life in a way that makes it hard for you to cope.<br /><br />Discussion:<br />1. Do you know that there are other methods for insomnia besides taking medicine?<br />2. Are you suffering from insomnia due to external reasons? Or do you not know the reason?<br />3. Did you solve your insomnia problem later on ?<br />4. Is there a good way to provide people with insomnia ?<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Session 2: 7 Benefits Of Being A Vegetarian<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://youtu.be/7x2R3E3RyZM">https://youtu.be/7x2R3E3RyZM</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Discussion: <br />1.Do you think it's better to be vegetarian?<br />2.
